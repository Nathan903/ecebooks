<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch10" class="calibre6">Letters in the New Testament</a></p>
<p class="pf">Of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament, fully twenty-one appear in letter form, and two additional letters are found embedded within a narrative work (Acts 15:23–29 and 23:26–30). Since the Scriptures of the early church, the OT, contain no letters at all, such a large number of letters would be unusual were it not for the fact that the letter was a very common form of communication in the first-century Mediterranean world. The letters that have been preserved from that time deal with every phase of life — homes, schools, public markets, places of business, religious assemblies, philosophical debates, political forums, and the theater. So pervasive were letters that essays cast in letter form were used for the instruction of students and for other educational or literary purposes, and a favorite form of education was to have students write fictitious letters in the style of some famous orator or intellectual. Letters were therefore indispensable for domestic, cultural, and social life. So it is not at all surprising that the early church’s missionaries and congregations, needing to remain in contact with one another, would turn to the letter to do that.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch10ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch10ah01" class="calibre6">10.1. WRITING MATERIALS AND DELIVERY OF LETTERS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Some of the earliest letters that have been preserved were written on clay tablets with characters formed by pressing the sharp end of a stylus into the clay (cuneiform). Less bulky materials were also used for letters. Some, for example, were written on potsherds, usually on the concave side of pieces of jars (ostraca). Also used were flakes of limestone, pieces of wood, or pieces of parchment, vellum, or coarser leather. Sometimes letters were written on tablets of wood coated with wax, which could then be smoothed over and used again.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre8">By far the most common material for letters, however, was papyrus, used as early as 3000 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>. Papyrus (from which our word “paper” is derived) was made from a reed of the same name that grew abundantly in Egypt, where the “paper” was manufactured and exported to the whole Mediterranean world. There it found uses as widespread as our modern uses of paper, from writing material for philosophical treatises or orders from the king to notes from students to their parents asking for money, or even for wrapping fish.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Papyrus was made by taking the pithy interior of the reed, slicing it longitudinally, laying overlapping strips side by side horizontally (“recto”) with another layer laid vertically (“verso”), and then hammering or pressing it together. A kind of glue, frequently the muddy water of the Nile, was often applied to make the reeds stick together. When the finished papyrus was dry, it was polished to make <a id="pg273" class="calibre3"></a>the surface smooth. There were a variety of grades of papyrus, depending on size (widths from 15 to 32 cm.), whiteness, and smoothness. Normally twenty sheets of papyrus would be glued into a roll, from which pieces of desired length would then be cut. Writing was done with reed pens, pointed and split like quill pens of a much later time. Ink was kept in a dried cake and was dissolved for writing by being touched with the moistened pen. The best side on which to write was the recto, though if the letter were long enough it could be continued on the verso.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">On the Manufacture of Papyrus</p>
<p class="sbaft">Pliny the Elder was a prominent Roman statesman of the first century, perhaps best known for his multi-volume <em class="calibre5">Natural History,</em> which summarized all contemporary knowledge on nature. The following paragraph describes how the papyrus reed was used to make paper for writing (Pliny, <em class="calibre5">Natural History</em> 13.23.74).</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">The process of making paper from papyrus is to split it with a needle into very thin strips made as broad as possible, the best quality being in the center of the plant, and so on in the order of its splitting up. The first quality used to be called “hieratic paper” and was in early times devoted solely to books connected with religion, but in a spirit of flattery it was given the name of Augustus, just as the second best was called “Livia paper” after his consort, and thus the name “hieratic” came down to the third class.</p>

<p class="sbh">On “Taking a Letter”</p>
<p class="sbaft">Letter writing in Roman antiquity often involved the employment of a secretary (sometimes known as a scribe or amanuensis). The business of correspondence called for other roles as well, including the copyist, the letter carrier, and the one who would read the letter aloud to the addressee(s). In a given instance, the secretary might function in one or more of these additional roles, or in none of them.</p>
<p class="sbl">In the actual production of letters, the role of secretaries, and thus their potential contribution to the final product, varied widely. In some cases, the secretary essentially controlled some or all of the content of a letter. Accordingly, the secretary, whether named in the correspondence or not, functioned in roles that we might call coauthor or composer. Though the “author” took primary responsibility for the letter, the secretary spoke in the author’s voice and represented him or her to the addressee(s) with little or no substantive input from the author. In other cases, the secretary performed at the bidding of the author — serving more as a recorder or perhaps as an editor. As recorders, secretaries might work from their own notes taken from a hearing with the author, they might work with an almost word-for-word dictation, or they might work from the author’s own notes or explicit instructions.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">So important was papyrus for the smooth functioning of the Roman world that its sale appears to have been a state monopoly. The Roman author Pliny notes that shortages during the reign of Tiberius upset normal life to the extent that Roman senators were appointed as umpires to supervise the distribution of papyrus (<em class="calibre5">Natural History</em> 13.18.89). Because the better grades of papyrus were expensive, sheets of such papyrus were sometimes erased and reused; such a reused piece of papyrus is called a “palimpsest.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">For the most part, letters were dictated to a scribe, often a professional who <a id="pg274" class="calibre3"></a>was hired for that purpose. A scribe would be secured if the person wanting to send a letter was illiterate or simply did not want to take the time to write in his or her own hand. Sometimes the scribe would use a wooden tablet coated with wax to take the dictation, then transcribe the letter to a sheet of papyrus. There is evidence that a kind of Latin shorthand was in use by the first century, and there may have been a kind of Greek shorthand as well. The complete letter was then folded in such a way that space was left for the name and place of the person to whom it was addressed. The letter was then tied with string and sealed, often with a mud seal; envelopes were not used.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Delivery of personal letters in NT times was a rather difficult procedure, since postal service for private individuals did not exist as we know it. The first postal service was created by the Persians sometime around the fifth century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>, with an elaborate network of roads and relay stations for fresh horses. Classical Greece had no comparable service, but one was established in the eastern part of the Mediterranean world by Alexander the Great and his successors. The best system in antiquity was the Roman <em class="calibre5">cursus publicus,</em> reserved for military dispatches and official correspondence. It too had an elaborate system of relay stations placed (in Latin, “placed” is <em class="calibre5">positum,</em> from which our word “post” is derived) at appropriate intervals. While wealthy individuals and commercial enterprises could hire messengers to carry communications, there was no such service available to the ordinary person. He or she would have to entrust a letter to a friend for delivery, as evidently Paul did when he entrusted to Phoebe the letter he wrote to the Christians in Rome (Rom 16:1–2). Lacking that, one would have to find a traveler going to the destination of the letter to carry it along, obviously not an entirely reliable system.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Because of the fragile nature of papyrus, most of the papyrus letters that have survived to today were written or delivered in Egypt, where the papyrus was preserved from destruction by the dry climate. Indeed, almost all the papyrus letters that we have come from the drier area south of Alexandria and the Nile delta. The earliest period from which a large number of letters have been preserved was the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphos (282–246 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>). Most such letters are found in Egyptian cemeteries, either buried with the person there entombed, left there to communicate with the dead, discarded there, or put in tombs for safekeeping. Others have even been found used for stuffing the inside of mummified crocodiles.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch10ah02"><a href="part0002.html#rch10ah02" class="calibre6">10.2. DEVELOPMENT AND PURPOSE OF LETTERS</a></p>
<p class="pf">The Greek word meaning “letter” <em class="calibre5">(epistol<span class="dcrit">ē</span>)</em> derives from a verb meaning “give an oral order,” indicating that letters originally served military or diplomatic purposes. It was not long, however, before letters became much more widely used for <a id="pg275" class="calibre3"></a>communication among family members or friends. In fact most of the letters that have been preserved from antiquity deal with matters of household and friendship. Because of the highly stratified society in the Greco-Roman world, many letters deal with client-patron relationships (see <a href="part0006.html#ch02" class="calibre3">chapter 2</a> above, <a href="part0006.html#ch02ah03bh03" class="calibre3">section 2.3.3</a>), often as a client’s means of asking for particular favors from a patron.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Because a letter frequently dealt with matters that, but for distance, would have been conducted face to face, letters were regarded as a substitute for the presence of the person writing and hence as a less satisfactory means of communication. A letter for that reason would often mention a future meeting at which a more satisfactory conversation could be conducted. As a result, ancient stylists compared the letter to half of a spoken conversation and hence argued that the letter should be conversational in tone. A letter was thus not to be overly long or oratorical in tone and was not to contain the technical language of a treatise. Rather, it should, as part of a conversation, communicate the writer’s personality and reflect his or her moods (cf. Gal 4:20).</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch10ah03"><a href="part0002.html#rch10ah03" class="calibre6">10.3. ARAMAIC LETTERS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Because they were written within a highly stratified society, ancient letters, and even their forms, reflect the relative social status of the writer in relation to the receiver. That is true of Aramaic letters from as early as the fifth or sixth centuries <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>, where forms still evident in letters written centuries later and in other languages are used. So, for example, letters written from an inferior to a superior had one form, while those from superior to inferior had another, and those written between equals yet another. This led to highly stereotyped forms, which allow us even today to determine the relative social positions of the sender and receiver of ancient letters. The order of names at the beginning of a letter was one such indication of social position. When inferiors wrote to superiors, the receiver was named first, then the senders, followed by greetings and invocations to the gods on the addressee’s behalf. When a superior addressed an inferior or one wrote to a social equal, the sender was named first, then the receiver; sometimes the invoked divine blessing would also be omitted. Thus, when one wrote to a social superior, the form would be “To A from B, everyday we call on the gods to give you life, prosperity, and health.” To an equal or inferior, it would be “A to B, greetings, may the gods bless you richly.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">So an Aramaic ostracon from the sixth century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> begins: “To my lord Mikayah from your servant Gaddul; may you live long and well! I bless you by YHH and Khnum [names of gods],” or, again, an Aramaic papyrus of the same period from Elephantine begins: “To [name illegible] from [name illegible]; may the God of heaven bless my lords richly at all times, and may the God of heaven be <a id="pg276" class="calibre3"></a>merciful to you.” Here the addressee is the social superior of the writer. In another sixth-century Elephantine papyrus, the opening reads: “It is . . . the scribe Nakht who addresses the scribe Aau . . . . May Arsaphes [a god] help you and Ptah [another god] . . . gladden you with life. . . .” In this case writer and receiver are social equals. Again, a letter from a Persian official from the fifth century begins: “From Aratahaya to Nakhthor, I send you greetings and best wishes for your good health. . . .” Here the writer is the superior of the receiver. That is also the case with the letter quoted in Daniel 4, where the king’s name is given first, then the receivers; the invoked divine blessing is also omitted. Finally, in a letter written between equals, an early form reads: “It is the scribe Meh who greets the scribe Yey Junior: In life, prosperity and health and in the favor of Amon-Re, king of the gods. . . .” Here the opening form: “A to B, greetings” with a following blessing shows writer and receiver to be social equals.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch10ah04"><a href="part0002.html#rch10ah04" class="calibre6">10.4. HELLENISTIC LETTERS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Such stereotypical conventions of letter writings persisted, with some variations, right down to the Greco-Roman period, within which the NT letters were written, much as our conventional “Dear (Name)” and “Sincerely yours” as opening and closing have persisted from earlier times even when the one addressed is not particularly dear to the writer and the writer may be anything but sincere in intention in writing the letter. The Hellenistic letter consisted of three basic parts: letter opening, letter body, and letter closing.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">• The opening included identification of sender and receiver, a greeting, and sometimes a health wish and/or a prayer on behalf of the reader.</p>
<p class="blf">• The letter body consisted of</p>
<p class="sbul">– a body-opening usually giving the intention of the letter and providing a transition to the body-middle,</p>
<p class="sbul">– a body-middle where the intention was spelled out, and</p>
<p class="sbul">– a body-closing, which usually contained three elements:</p>
<p class="bl">– why the letter was written,</p>
<p class="bl">– how the readers should respond to it and</p>
<p class="bl">– a proposal of further contact by visit or another letter.</p>
<p class="blf">• The letter closing included some kind of wish for prosperity for the recipient, and occasionally greetings from third parties.</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">Not only were the forms stereotyped, but even the language used followed regular patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Because Hellenistic society was as rigidly hierarchical as the Persian and <a id="pg277" class="calibre3"></a>Egyptian societies of earlier times, the letter opening, as in the Aramaic letters, indicated the social superior by naming that person first. Thus, all petitions to the king and queen of Egypt in the Ptolemaic period (third century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> onward), and sometimes to other high officials, had the form: “To B (name in dative case) greetings (Greek <em class="calibre5">chairein</em>) A (name in nominative case)” meaning “it is to B that A sends greetings.” Jewish authors followed the same format, as is indicated by 2 Maccabees, which opens in the form of a letter. It begins with the addressees named first, but then contains two greetings (1:1), one the usual Greek <em class="calibre5">chairein,</em> the second the more Jewish wish for peace (Greek <em class="calibre5">eir<span class="dcrit">ē</span>n<span class="dcrit">ē</span>,</em> Hebrew <em class="calibre5">shalom</em>). There then follows a thanksgiving (1:11). The body of the letter was usually introduced by the petition itself, or, if addressed to an equal or an inferior, by some such phrase as “I want you to know,” “Do not think that,” or “I appeal to you.” The content was determined by the subject matter of the letter. The closing included the Greek word <em class="calibre5">eutychei</em> (sometimes <em class="calibre5">dieutychei</em>), meaning something like “good fortune,” and used in the sense of “farewell.” When the writer was of inferior status, as were the writers of letters of petition to the royal house, no familiar traits such as opening or concluding health wish, prayer of supplication on the recipient’s behalf, or greetings from third parties were included.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In more familiar letters, the opening formula was “A (name in nominative case) to B (name in dative case) greetings <em class="calibre5">(chairein)</em>” followed by a wish, sometimes in the form of a prayer to the god(s) for the health and prosperity of the recipient. Often attached to this was an assurance of the well-being of the sender. So a letter from the third century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> begins “Dromon to Zenon greeting. I give thanks to all the gods if you yourself enjoy good health. . . . I myself am also well. . . .” Another from the first century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> begins “Isadora to her brother Askias greeting and may you at all times enjoy good health, just as I pray. . . .”</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter closing in familiar letters regularly contained the Greek word <em class="calibre5">err<span class="dcrit">ō</span>so</em> (“be strong” in the sense of “farewell”), and, if greetings from third parties were conveyed, such greetings were expressed with some form of the Greek verb <em class="calibre5">aspazesthai</em> (“greet”), in the imperative if greetings were conveyed to someone (“Give greetings to A”), in the active if the greeting were being delivered by someone (“B greets A”).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Depending on the situation, any of the elements could be expanded: the sender could say more by way of self-identification or about his or her situation, and the recipient could be further identified or his or her situation described further. The health wish and/or prayer could also be expanded to conform to the particular circumstances of the receiver. As we shall see below, such expansion is often found in the NT letters, particularly those written by Paul.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch10ah05"><a id="pg278" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch10ah05" class="calibre6">10.5. LETTERS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</a></p>
<p class="pf">The letters contained in the NT do not resemble the common papyri from the lowest levels of Hellenistic culture, nor do they display the marks of those authors who had received formal rhetorical training. Rather, they fall somewhere between those two extremes, and show some additional influence of the Jewish subculture of the period. There was a time when NT scholars classified Hellenistic letters as either letters or epistles, with “letter” designating personal correspondence written in the style of common speech and “epistle” designating more formal correspondence written in a more high-flown literary style. New Testament letters were then put in the former category, as reflecting the more common speech of less educated people. Further analysis has proved that such a differentiation is too broad to account for the many different kinds of correspondence of the period. Current analysis looks at letters in terms of the social status of the writer and receiver and whether the content is of an official or a more familiar nature. In form, NT letters resemble more the familiar than the official letter, although they are longer than most contemporary letters of that type and period, showing the instructional intention of the authors.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A few of the letters in the NT do reflect the form of the typical Hellenistic letter, most specifically the letter between Roman officials embedded in Acts 15:23–29, where both opening and closing forms reflect normal conventions. A second letter in Acts (23:26–30) has a typical Hellenistic opening, but the closing is omitted. The same is true of James, 2 Peter, and Jude. Hebrews, by contrast, has a full epistolary ending but lacks an epistolary opening, and is closest in form in the NT to a treatise produced, partially at least, in the form of an epistle. 1 John, usually included among the “letters” in the NT, has what could be considered a letter-body but neither opening nor closing and so lacks two of the three typical components of the Hellenistic letter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While the majority of the letters in the NT identify only one sender (Acts 23:26; Rom 1:1; Eph 1:1; 1 Tim 1:1; 2 Tim 1:1; Tit 1:1; Jas 1:1; 1 Pet 1:1; 2 Pet 1:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1; Jude 1), which is typical of Hellenistic letters, others identify multiple senders (Acts 15:23; 1 Cor 1:1; 2 Cor 1:1; Gal 1:1–2; Phil 1:1; Col 1:1; 1 Thess 1:1; 2 Thess 1:1; Phlm 1), perhaps to identify the content as representing a broader Christian tradition rather than the views of one person. In contrast, only a few letters identify only one person as recipient (Acts 23:26; 1 Tim 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2; Tit 1:1; 3 John 1), while the majority indicate multiple recipients (Acts 15:23; Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 1:1; Gal 1:2; Eph 1:1; Phil 1:1; Col 1:2; 1 Thess 1:1; 2 Thess 1:1; Phlm 1–2; Jas 1:1; 1 Pet 1:1–2; 2 Pet 2:2; Jude 1), frequently the members of the Christian community located in the place to which the letter was sent. Typical for NT letters is the expanded form both of the identification of the sender (Rom 1:1–6; 1 Cor 1:1; 2 Cor 1:1; Gal 1:1–2; Eph 1:1; Col 1:1; 1 Tim 1:1; 2 Tim 1:1; Tit 1:1–3; <a id="pg279" class="calibre3"></a>Phlm 1:1; Jas 1:1; Jude 1:1) and of the recipients (1 Cor 1:2; Eph 1:1; 1 Thess 1:1; 2 Thess 1:1; 1 Tim 1:2; Tit 1:4; Phlm 1:1–2a; 1 Pet 1:1b-2; 2 Pet 1:1b; 2 John 1; Jude 1:1), such expansions composed with specifically Christian vocabulary, which shows the theological framework within which these letters were composed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is in the form of the greeting that the difference between the usual Hellenistic letter and the Christian letter begins to be even more apparent. While the normal Hellenistic greeting consists simply in the word <em class="calibre5">chairein,</em> the NT letters expand and change the greeting in a number of ways. While two Christian letters (Acts 15:23; Jas 1:1; Acts 23:26 represents itself as secular) do begin with the usual “greetings” (Greek <em class="calibre5">chairein</em>), other NT letters, in what may be a play on words, substitute the word “grace” (Greek <em class="calibre5">charis</em>) for the common <em class="calibre5">chairein,</em> thus immediately differentiating Christian from non-Christian letters. In addition to “grace,” some of the letters attributed to Paul (Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:3; 2 Cor 1:2; Gal 1:3; Eph 1:2; Phil 1:1; Col 1:2; 1 Thess 1:1; 2 Thess 1:2) and those attributed to Peter (1 Pet 2:1; 2 Pet 1:2) add “peace” (Greek <em class="calibre5">eir<span class="dcrit">ē</span>n<span class="dcrit">ē</span></em>), thus incorporating both Greek and Jewish greetings. Three letters, including two attributed to Paul (1 Tim 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2; 2 John 3), add a third word, “mercy” (Greek <em class="calibre5">eleos</em>) to “grace and peace.” Jude also uses three words in the greeting (v. 2), with the characteristic Christian word “love” <em class="calibre5">(agap<span class="dcrit">ē</span>)</em> in addition to “mercy” and “peace.” In all these instances, the expansion on the usual Hellenistic greeting formula embodies typically Christian concepts and immediately shows the different kind of cultural framework within which these letters were written.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The final element of the letter-opening in the Hellenistic letter, the health-wish with its occasional accompanying prayer, is also significantly altered in NT letters. While one NT letter does have a true prayer on behalf of its recipients (3 John 2), others refer to prayer on behalf of the recipients (Rom 1:10; Phil 1:4; Col 1:3; 1 Thess 1:2; Phlm 4). Others substitute a statement of either thanksgiving (Greek <em class="calibre5">eucharistein</em>) to God for some characteristic of the recipients (Rom 1:8; 1 Cor 1:4; Phil 1:3; Col 1:3; 1 Thess 1:2; 2 Thess 1:3; 2 Tim 1:3; Phlm 4) or blessing (Greek <em class="calibre5">eulog<span class="dcrit">ē</span>tos</em>), expressing some divine activity related to the situation addressed in the letter (2 Cor 1:3; Eph 1:3; 1 Pet 1:3).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Although the letter-openings of NT letters are thus expanded beyond the normal extent of Hellenistic letters, the form in which the greetings are cast, with the sender named first and then the recipients (“A to B, greetings”) shows that they fall in the category of familiar rather than formal letters. Formally, therefore, writer and readers are acknowledged to have the same status, reflecting socially the kind of contact typical between friends or members of the same family rather than the status of suppliants to a superior or the giver of instructions to an inferior. The equality among all Christians, formally expressed by Paul in Gal 3:28 (cf. 1 Cor 12:13; Col 3:11) is thus embodied in the very form of the letters that contain that message.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg280" class="calibre3"></a>The letter-body in Hellenistic letters was normally adapted to the situation addressed, and hence Christian letters display no startling distinctiveness by showing that characteristic. The thanksgiving of some NT letters serves as a body-opening in which the intention of the letter or the content to be discussed is given, and the body-closing often refers to a future visit by the author (Rom 15:24; 1 Cor 16:5; 2 Cor 13:1; Phlm 22; 2 John 12; 3 John 13; in Phil 1:26 such a reference occurs earlier in the letter), both characteristics of the body of the Hellenistic letter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The NT epistolary closings also show the formal characteristics of the Hellenistic letter. Greetings from third parties, also typical of familiar letters, are frequently included, with the characteristic word <em class="calibre5">aspazesthai</em> used for that purpose (Rom 16:2–16, 21–23; 1 Cor 16:19; 2 Cor 13:12; Phil 4:21–22; Col 4:18; 1 Thess 5:26; 2 Thess 3:17; 2 Tim 4:9–21; Tit 3:15; Phlm 23–24; Heb 13:24; 1 Pet 5:13; 2 John 13; 3 John 15). While the usual word for “farewell” (Greek <em class="calibre5">err<span class="dcrit">ō</span>sthe</em>) in the Hellenistic letter appears in only one NT letter (Acts 15:29), two other NT letters contain specifically Christian vocabulary serving the function of the farewell (1 Cor 16:24; Gal 6:24). In most instances, however, a benediction is placed where the farewell would occur in a Hellenistic letter (Rom 16:20; 1 Cor 16:23; 2 Cor 13:13; Gal 6:18; Eph 6:23; Phil 4:23; Col 4:18; 1 Thess 5:23, 28; 2 Thess 3:18; 1 Tim 6:21; 2 Tim 4:22; Tit 3:15; Phlm 25; Heb 13:25; 1 Pet 5:14; 2 John 15; Jude 24–25), showing again the extent to which Christians modified that epistolary form to conform to their own cultural self-understanding. The epistolary closing is adapted in some NT letters in a further way when the identification of the scribe who wrote the letter (as in Rom 16:22), often present in the Hellenistic letter, has in its place words written by the author in his own hand (1 Cor 16:21; Gal 6:11–18; Col 4:18; 2 Thess 3:17), perhaps in a further gesture of familiarity with the readers. A final adaptation of the epistolary closing is the admonition to the Christian recipients to greet one another with a “holy kiss” (Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 16:20; 2 Cor 13:12; 1 Thess 5:14; 1 Pet 5:14), a further indication of the self-understanding of Christians in terms of a family, since kisses were normally bestowed only on family or close friends.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If letters constitute the largest component of the NT, letters claiming Paul as their author constitute the largest component among the letters. Some thirteen letters bear the name of Paul as sender. Although some ancient lists included Hebrews as a fourteenth Pauline letter, it does not so designate itself, and its style and content are different enough from the other letters claiming Paul as author that such inclusion of Hebrews among the Pauline letters has fallen into disuse. The importance of letters in the early Christian movement is indicated by the fact that more letters were written than have been preserved. For example, a letter Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians (see 1 Cor 5:9–10) and one they wrote to Paul (7:1) have not been preserved, as also Paul’s letter to the Laodiceans (Col 4:17). A letter written in Paul’s name apparently also circulated early (2 Thess 2:2). Letters also make up the bulk of the opening chapters of the book of Revelation.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg281" class="calibre3"></a>The NT letters are placed in the canon after the Gospels and Acts and demonstrate the writings of the apostles whose activities are described in Acts. The letters of Paul are placed first, perhaps because they are by far the most numerous of those accepted into the canon, perhaps because his activity dominates the second half of the narratives contained in Acts. His letters are arranged in descending order of length, with the longest, Romans, first, and the shortest, Philemon, the last.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Following Hebrews, placed where it is because of its early association with Paul but located at the very end of the Pauline collection to designate a certain discomfort with this association, the remaining letters are arranged in the order of the apostolic names listed in Gal. 2:9. Following that order, James is placed first, then the two letters attributed to Peter. The next three letters are associated with John, although they do not bear his name. The first has no epistolary opening at all, while the second and third claim authorship by “the elder,” a title early associated with the apostle John. The final letter is Jude, a name included in the lists of apostles given in the Gospels, but omitted from the list in Gal 2:9. Perhaps for that reason it was placed last among the letters.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Through this collection of letters, we gain a lively insight into the minds and hearts of the early Christian communities as they struggled to be faithful to their Lord in the often hostile environment of the first-century Mediterranean word. Careful study of their content will give us a vivid impression of the problems those communities faced, and some of the ways they sought to overcome them. It is upon that study that we embark in the following pages.</p>
