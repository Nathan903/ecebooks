<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch11" class="calibre6">Paul and His World</a></p>
<p class="pf">The apostle Paul grew up in, and preached to, a world very different from ours, and it will be helpful to survey some of the aspects of that difference. Unless we are aware of those differences, we are likely to assume that Paul shared our views about the world and then become open to finding something in Paul’s writing that the apostle never intended. Reading and understanding ancient documents like the NT require us to pay attention to the presuppositions underlying the writers’ views lest we impose our own ideas on the text and then forfeit all chance of learning something from them we have not already known. Ancient documents present a challenge to our way of understanding reality, and the NT is no exception. For that reason, we have to know something about the way Paul’s contemporaries viewed the world before we investigate what we can know about Paul’s life within that world and about what he intended to say to that world in his letters.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch11ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch11ah01" class="calibre6">11.1. THE WORLD</a></p>
<p class="pf">While the understanding of the world in which Paul lived was different in many ways from our understanding of the one we inhabit, we will limit ourselves to looking at three aspects that will highlight the differences between the two worlds. Those aspects are attitudes to what is new and what is old, the relationship between religion and politics, and the structure and role of the family.</p>
<p class="ah"><a id="pg284" class="calibre6"></a>11.1.1. New and Old</p>
<p class="pf">One of the assumptions we bring to our understanding of our world is that what is new tends to be superior to what is old. This expresses itself not only in the desire to be up on the latest fads in speech, clothing, and the like, but also in the language used by those who want to persuade us to act in a certain way, that is, in advertising. For example, phrases such as “new and improved” or “newly discovered formula” reflect our deep-seated conviction that what is new is best and that what is old tends to be outmoded. This outlook assumes that we are cleverer than our ancestors and makes the world as we know it the measure of reality.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This outlook is also often carried into historical study, where the assumption, sometimes declared, sometimes unspoken, is that if something does not or, in our view, cannot, happen now, then it can never have happened. Hence, much of what ancient writers report is considered untrue or impossible, because such things do not happen in our world as we perceive and explain it to ourselves. This makes ourselves and our understanding the measure of historical truth. The present is taken to be superior to the past and hence is used to measure truth from the past.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The world Paul inhabited looked at things quite differently. What was old was considered far superior to what was recent or new. This was based on the view that the world, like a human being, wears out with the passage of time and deteriorates from the better state it once had. So the Roman writer Seneca can say that all believe that people of the past were always superior by nature to those of succeeding generations (<em class="calibre5">Epistle</em> 90.44), the Stoic philosopher and orator Dio Chrysostom affirms that there is no doubt that the world, before it was worn out, produced better things (<em class="calibre5">Discourse</em> 31.75), and Chrysostom concludes that each succeeding age shows a steady decline and clearly represents less noble features than the preceding periods (<em class="calibre5">Discourse</em> 21.1). If, then, the ancients were nobler and more intelligent and closer to the gods, the source of wisdom lies in the past, not the present. The past is the measure of truth, and to prove a thing true one need only prove it was traditionally believed to be true. One thus looked to antiquity for wisdom, an antiquity that, as the orator Quintilian observed, is commended to us by the possession of a certain majesty, almost a sanctity (<em class="calibre5">Institutio oratoria</em> 1.6.1). One would not advertise soap in that culture as “new and improved”; one would rather say “unchanged for centuries” or “exactly the same as your great grandmother knew it.” What is old is best, and what is new is inferior and looked on with suspicion. The culture had a generally pessimistic outlook, since the future can only be worse than the present. So if Christianity affirmed itself to be a “new religion” it would immediately be met with suspicion if not outright rejection.</p>
<p class="ah"><a id="pg285" class="calibre6"></a>11.1.2. Politics and Religion</p>
<p class="pf">One does not have to engage in serious conversation very long, particularly about one’s religious or political beliefs, to hear that “religion and politics don’t mix.” The ACLU has devoted virtually all its resources to seeing that such a mixture does not happen in American culture, and the People for the American Way never tire of challenging anything that can look like government sanctioning of some religious belief or practice. American culture simply assumes that the best way for government to function is for it to tolerate or ignore any and all religious beliefs in the conduct of its business.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Again, such a view is almost the polar opposite of the view current in the world of Paul’s time. There, one could not imagine a state without its own religion, and any religion not connected with a state or an ethnic group was looked on with great suspicion. The Romans simply assumed that every people had its own god(s) and hence its own religious practices, and Rome did nothing to interfere with the national religious practices of the peoples it conquered and included in its empire, provided the exercise of that religion did not foment rebellion against Rome and its hegemony. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions that Augustus wanted subject nations to continue their own religious customs (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 19.5.2) and also reports that the Roman emperor Claudius wrote to Jews (in <small class="calibre9">CE</small> 45) that he wished every nation to maintain the religious practices that are traditional with it (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 20.1.2). Romans made no effort to convert conquered peoples to “Roman religion.” In fact, the Roman senate once decreed that rules governing the religious conduct of the citizens of Rome could not be applied to people beyond the boundaries of that city, and Emperor Trajan wrote to his friend Pliny (ca. 110) that no foreign city is capable of receiving the kind of consecration conferred by Roman law (Pliny, <em class="calibre5">Letters</em> 10.1). The one religion the Romans did suppress on occasion was Druidism, because of its practices of human sacrifice and cannibalism (Pliny, <em class="calibre5">Natural History</em> 30.4.13). Nor did Roman custom encourage Romans to participate in foreign religions, although by the middle of the first century <small class="calibre9">CE</small> such restrictions had been eased by Caligula and then Claudius. But even then, it was thought that participation in the rites of a religion other than one’s own disgraced and transgressed the god-given dignity of ancestral religion (Plutarch, <em class="calibre5">On Superstition</em> 166B).</p>
<p class="calibre8">As a result, nothing in public life was undertaken without first seeking to determine whether the enterprise enjoyed divine favor. Roman priests would observe the flights of birds to see whether they turned to the right <em class="calibre5">(ad dextram),</em> a sign of favor, or to the left <em class="calibre5">(ad sinistram),</em> a sign of disfavor. Or they would consult the entrails of a goat to see whether the shape of the liver indicated favor or disfavor. This kind of religious involvement in public affairs even extended to military campaigns. Pliny tells us that before an enemy’s city was attacked, Roman priests, using a prescribed formula, would invoke the local gods, inviting them to abandon the <a id="pg286" class="calibre3"></a>city and go over to the Romans, who would then give them equal or greater worship. In that way, the city would be vulnerable to attack, being stripped of divine protection. Even local celebrations, which included athletic contests, free food, jugglers, magicians, speeches, and parades, would also include sacrifice to the local deities. For the people of Paul’s world, any public activity that lacked a religious dimension would have been unthinkable.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The problem that the Christian communities presented to the Romans was not that they represented an “illegal religion.” That phrase does not occur in non-Christian Latin literature (nor does “legal religion”), and the Romans were ready to tolerate any religion celebrated by an ethnic group. The problem was that Christians did not constitute a single ethnic group, as did the Jews, for example, nor did they celebrate ancestral rites, presided over by a priesthood, in a temple set apart for such worship. For those reasons, they would not have looked like a religion to Roman authorities in Paul’s world. As long as Christians were regarded as a Jewish sect, the Romans had no problem with Christianity, since the Jewish religion was recognizable to the authorities as a religion: its religious customs were observed by one ethnic group that traced its ancestry to Palestine, and it had its temple in Jerusalem, where ancient rites were conducted by a priestly class. Looked at apart from Judaism, however, the Christian communities would have looked more like the kind of groups that proliferated throughout the empire and bore the name <em class="calibre5">collegium</em> or <em class="calibre5">sodalitas.</em> Such groups shared some common characteristic, such as their trade — wine merchants, for example, or tailors or shipowners — their place of origin, their interest in athletics, theater, or music, their common age or national background, or even the neighborhood they lived in. Again, the problem with the Christians, once they were no longer regarded as a sect of Jews, was that they did not look like any legitimate <em class="calibre5">collegium,</em> since not all members of the Christian community had anything in common except their allegiance to Christ. Groups with no common ties among its members, the Romans suspected, were meeting for political purposes (they called such a group a <em class="calibre5">haetaeria</em>), and such groups were strictly forbidden. When Christians first encountered persecution, therefore, it was more likely because they looked like an illegal <em class="calibre5">collegium</em> than like an “illegal” religion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What most got Christians into trouble was the fact that, because all public activities included the worship of local gods, Christians could not participate in them and so held aloof from normal social activities. This earned them the accusation that they were afflicted by a “hatred of the human race” (Latin <em class="calibre5">odium humani generis,</em> e.g., Tacitus, <em class="calibre5">Annals</em> 15.44; Pliny, <em class="calibre5">Letters</em> 10.96). Whatever the legal status of Christians was during Paul’s lifetime, it was their “standoffishness” that brought them into disrepute with their pagan neighbors throughout the Roman Empire. In all likelihood, such general anti-Christian feelings among local populaces more than imperial edicts motivated the hatred for and persecutions of Christians in <a id="pg287" class="calibre3"></a>general. Christians thus suffered the fate of any group in the empire that isolated itself from society and refused to conform to normal expectations. It was the reaction to such social isolation that tempted Christians, including members of the new groups of converts gathered by Paul in various cities of the empire, to abandon their faith or to compromise it with pagan customs.</p>
<p class="ah">11.1.3. Family and Empire</p>
<p class="pf">The family as we know it in our world is in a state of transition morally and legally, but generally the word “family” conjures up a unit consisting of a husband and wife and perhaps also children. The changes of the past few decades have tended to equalize the respective functions of husband and wife within the family, so that it is now common for both husband and wife to hold jobs outside the home and to share in care of the children. In our culture, children also enjoy a large measure of equality and even of independence within the family unit; in some instances the schedule of the family tends to revolve around the needs of the children. While the family retains a measure of importance in our culture, it does not represent the structure in terms of which our government is ordered.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p class="calibre8">Such was the case, however, in Paul’s world. The basic organization of the Roman world was derived from that of the family, which was highly structured and hierarchical. Family units in the Roman world tended to be quite large, including several generations of adults, along with children, and, in the cases of more affluent families, slaves. Within those families, the basic relationships of husband and wife, parents and children, and master and slaves were highly structured, with each <a id="pg288" class="calibre3"></a>person occupying a set and specified place. Thus, within the hierarchy of the family, the husband stood at the top, then the wife, then the children, and finally the various slaves and attendants. Any family unit that tampered with that structure or that did not observe it scrupulously was liable to social ostracism and even in some cases legal action. Families that did not discipline their slaves, for example, that allowed them to be insolent, or that allowed their children too much freedom would be looked down on by their neighbors, and husbands who did not maintain control over their households would be held in contempt. The orator Chrysostom argued that the very safety of a household depended on the obedience of the slaves, since the disobedience and wickedness of slaves wrecked many households (<em class="calibre5">Discourse</em> 38.15). Tacitus argued that because some Germanic tribes had women as rulers they had fallen lower than slaves (<em class="calibre5">Germany</em> 45).</p>
<p class="calibre8">These hierarchical relationships were said to be based on “reason,” with men having the highest kind of reason, women having reason but in less developed form, children having undeveloped reason, and slaves being devoid of reason altogether. This understanding of familial hierarchy had additional importance because the Romans used it to justify their dominance over all other peoples: because the Romans were superior in “reason,” they were able so to triumph over all others. So the orator Cicero could argue that the Romans did not surpass the Spaniards in numbers, the Carthaginians in cunning, or the other residents of Italy in common sense. Rather, they won their empire because of “piety and religion,” both characteristics they included under the broader rubric “reason.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">This meant that any challenge to the hierarchical structure of the family was a challenge to the right of the Romans to rule the world, since that structure presented the rationale for Roman hegemony. Any group that argued that men and women were equal, for example, that children also had rights over against their parents, or that slaves were the equal of their masters would be open to charges of treason. The philosopher Arius Didymus wrote that seditions in cities occur whenever those with equal rights are compelled to be unequal or when those who are unequal have equality (<em class="calibre5">Politics</em> 151.9–12). On that basis, any Roman official who read in Paul’s letter to the Galatians that in Christ differences between men and women, Jews and Greeks, and slave and free have been done away with (3:28) would have reason to charge Christians with treason, since such views undermined the very rationale by which Rome justified its domination of the Mediterranean world. Those who accepted the message Paul carried to any who would listen in that world were thus open not only to social isolation because of the accusation that they hated other people, but also to the charge of treason against the Roman Empire, which sat astride that whole world. Having Christ rather than Caesar as Lord was therefore a risky thing in the empire, and the promise it represented and the difficulties it brought will both be apparent in the letters Paul wrote to those communities of Christians scattered in cities around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch11ah02"><a id="pg289" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch11ah02" class="calibre6">11.2. THE LIFE OF PAUL</a></p>
<p class="pf">As far as the date of Paul’s birth is concerned, we have no information at all. He was probably roughly the same age as Jesus, although he could have been ten years younger. His Christian missionary activity took place sometime between 35 and 60 <small class="calibre9">C.E.</small> He does not tell us where he was born, though Acts informs us that he was born in Tarsus. It is clear from Paul’s letters that he knew Greek as a native language and that he clearly knew how to deal with non-Jews. Since he apparently came from the Diaspora (Jews living outside Palestine), there is little difficulty with accepting Tarsus as his place of birth. That he was born of Jewish parents is quite certain; Acts makes that point clearly, and Paul himself mentions it several times in different letters. As a good Jew he would have been circumcised a week after his birth, and he confirms that he was (Phil 3:5). That he had two names, one Hebrew (Saul) and one Greek (Paul), is mentioned only in Acts; he never refers to himself as “Saul.” Yet his family belonged to the tribe of Benjamin (Phil 3:5), whose chief hero was Saul, and it was apparently the custom for Jewish people in the Diaspora to have two names, one Jewish and one Greek or Roman.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We have no information about Paul’s youth, but a tractate in the Jewish Mishnah (<em class="calibre5">Pirke Aboth</em> 5.21), admittedly a later text but containing earlier traditions, outlines the normal course of a young man’s life as follows: At five years of age, he would begin to learn to read the Scriptures; at ten, he would begin to read the Mishnah; at thirteen, he would take on the responsibility of fulfilling the commands of the Torah. At eighteen he would be old enough to marry. At twenty, a young Jew would be ready to embark on his calling, and he would “assume authority,” that is, come of age, when he was thirty.</p>
<p class="calibre8">How much of this was the case with Paul is hard to tell. Whether he ever married, for example, is difficult to determine. There is a later tradition (Eusebius, <em class="calibre5">Hist. Eccl.</em> 3.20.1) that Paul addressed his wife in one of his letters (perhaps Phil 4:3), but Acts is silent on the subject. Paul refers at one point (1 Cor 9:5) to his right to be accompanied by “a sister as a wife,” which implies he was married, but in the same letter (1 Cor 7:8) he counsels the unmarried and widows to remain as he is, implying that he was not married. It may be that at one point he was accompanied by his wife, but when she died, he did not remarry, but the evidence is quite ambiguous.</p>
<p class="calibre8">That Paul studied with Gamaliel in the course of pursuing his “calling” is affirmed in Acts (22:3), where Paul is reciting his credentials as a Jew, although he does not mention that this study occurred in Jerusalem. Paul himself is silent on that point in his letters, even where he is reciting similar credentials (2 Cor 11:22; Phil 3:5–6) or where he wants to emphasize that he did in fact know Jewish traditions (Gal 2:14). It would have strengthened Paul’s point to mention that he studied under Gamaliel in Jerusalem. Yet Paul is addressing Gentiles in those passages, <a id="pg290" class="calibre3"></a>and it is unlikely that the names of famous Jewish rabbis would have meant anything to them. Paul’s own testimony about his zealous study of the Jewish law and tradition indicates he did pursue extensive study in those topics, and it could well be that, as Acts suggests, Gamaliel was one with whom Paul studied.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Early Descriptions of Paul</p>
<p class="sbaft">There is no physical description of Paul in the NT, but such descriptions are to be found in later Christian writings. One such description is in a second-century writing called <em class="calibre5">The Acts of Paul and Thecla</em> (2.3):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">And he saw Paul coming, a man little of stature, thin-haired upon the head, crooked in the legs, of good state of body, with eyebrows joining and nose somewhat hooked, full of grace; for sometimes he appeared like a man, and sometime he had the face of an angel.</p>
</div>
<p class="sbaft">A second, much later description (sixth century) is found in the writings of John of Antioch:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">In person round-shouldered, with a sprinkling of grey on his head and beard, with an aquiline nose, graying eyes, meeting eyebrows, with a mixture of pale and red in his complexion and an ample beard. With a genial expression of countenance, he was sensible, earnest, easily accessible, sweet and inspired with the Holy Spirit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">We know that Paul worked with his hands at some trade (1 Cor 4:12; 1 Thess 2:9). Acts tells us that that trade was tentmaking (18:3). Such a trade would have been appropriate for someone who traveled as much as Paul did since it did not require that he carry heavy equipment from place to place. That such a trade meant he worked in leather has been argued, but leather tents were mostly restricted to the military, who had their own tentmakers. More likely he worked with linen, making the kind of tents and awnings that were regularly used in marketplaces, on the beach, over atriums of homes, and wherever else people needed to be protected from the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre8">That Paul was a Roman citizen is attested only in Acts (e.g., 16:37; 22:25–26). Paul never mentions it, and beatings with rods, like those he received (2 Cor 11:25), were not usually inflicted on Roman citizens. Yet, as Acts also makes clear, people were not always careful to ascertain the citizenship of someone they viewed <a id="pg291" class="calibre3"></a>as a troublemaker (Acts 16:22–23, 37–39) before they took action against them. Again, it seems difficult to imagine that such a tradition of Paul’s citizenship would arise without any historical basis at all. Thus the information in Acts may very well be accurate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul mentions that he was a Pharisee (Phil 3:5), as does Acts (23:6), and both say that he persecuted the church. Some uncertainty whether that persecution also occurred in and around Jerusalem is raised by Paul’s claim that even three years after his conversion he was still unknown by face to the churches in Judea (Gal 1:22). It is difficult to see how he would have been unknown to that degree if he had persecuted those particular Christian communities, although it is possible he directed those persecutions from afar.</p>
<p class="calibre8">That Paul’s conversion occurred in the neighborhood of Damascus is mentioned by Acts and confirmed by Paul in Gal 1:17. There are in fact three accounts of Paul’s conversion in Acts (9:1–9; 22:6–11; 26:12–26), but they differ in some details (cf. 9:7, where Paul alone sees a light but all present hear, with 22:9, where Paul alone hears but all see a light, or 26:16–18, where Jesus commissions Paul to go to the Gentiles, with 22:14–15 and 9:15, where Ananias informs Paul of his commission). Paul refers to his conversion in Gal 1:15–16 and 1 Cor 15:8 (perhaps also in 2 Cor 12:2–4), but in neither case does he give any details about where he was or what happened in connection with this event, such as being struck blind. He does make clear that this event was on a par with the other appearances of the risen Christ to his disciples (1 Cor 15:3–7) and that it completely turned Paul’s life around and reversed his values (Phil 3:7–8). That Paul turned to Christ out of despair or guilt at his inability to fulfill God’s law finds little support in his letters. His one statement about his life as a Pharisee claims that as far as doing what was right according to the law, he was in fact blameless (Phil 3:6). One gets the impression both from Acts and from Paul’s letters that Christ’s appearance to him took him by surprise and turned his life in a direction that he, as the church’s zealous persecutor, could hardly have imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is difficult to know how we are to go about reconstructing the events subsequent to Paul’s conversion and the course of his missionary career. Acts records that Paul, struck blind at the time of his conversion, was taken to Damascus where, after being sightless three days, he was visited by a Christian named Ananias, who restored his sight and explained the meaning of his confrontation with the risen Christ. After preaching “many days” in Damascus, a plot against his life made it necessary for him to be lowered over the city wall to escape. He went to Jerusalem, where he met the disciples (Acts 9:17–25). Because of his disputes with “Hellenists,” probably Hellenistic Jews, he went to Caesarea and then to Tarsus (9:26–30). Paul, on the other hand, recites a series of events that give a somewhat different picture. Paul insists that immediately after his conversion he conferred with no one, went to Arabia (probably the area to the east of the Jordan River), and then <a id="pg292" class="calibre3"></a>returned to Damascus (Gal 1:15–24). He does report the incident of escaping over the wall of Damascus in a basket and that this escape was necessitated by a plot instigated by King Aretas of Arabia. Evidently Paul had carried on some kind of activity in Damascus, probably Christian proclamation, that got him into trouble with the governing authorities. Paul also states that he did not go to Jerusalem until three years after his conversion, and that at that time he went only for a two-week period during which he met only Peter and James. That Paul supports this statement with an oath is meant to underline its truth. Subsequent to that visit, Paul agrees with Acts when he reports trips to the regions of Syria and Silicia, where, respectively, Damascus and Tarsus were located.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Acts records Paul returning to Jerusalem with Barnabas (ch. 11), going then to Antioch, and beginning his first missionary journey. They return to Jerusalem for a council on how to treat Gentiles who have become Christians (Acts 15), and Paul and others are commissioned to travel to the Gentile churches to tell them of certain food laws they must observe as Christians (Acts 15:22–29). Subsequently, in Antioch, Paul and Barnabas separate as the result of a dispute (15:39–40), and Paul undertakes his second and third missionary journeys without Barnabas. The second missionary journey ends with a visit to Jerusalem (18:22), and the third ends with Paul’s final visit there (21:15).</p>
<p class="calibre8">The details we can glean from Paul’s letters are difficult to fit into that framework. He insists that his second visit to Jerusalem did not occur until fourteen years had elapsed (Gal 2:1), though it is not clear whether this was fourteen years from the time of his conversion or from the time of the first visit to Jerusalem. <a id="pg293" class="calibre3"></a>During this visit it was agreed that he would be the evangelizer of the Gentiles and that Peter and the other disciples would have such responsibilities for the Jews (Gal 2:7–9). Paul reports no further visits to Jerusalem, although in Romans he mentions his plans to make a third trip (15:25–28).</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">The Reputation of the Pharisees</p>
<p class="sbo">Throughout his writings, Josephus characterizes the Pharisees as “a body of Jews with the reputation of excelling the rest of their nation in the observances of religion, and as exact exponents of the laws” (<em class="calibre5">J.W.</em> 1.110; 2.162). He also points out that they prided themselves on their “adherence to ancestral custom and claiming to observe the laws of which the Deity approves” (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 17.41). Paul appeals to their reputation when he recounts his Jewish credentials and shows his particular zeal for the law: “circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee” (Phil 3:4–5). A similar self-description is found in Acts: “I have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a Pharisee” (26:5).</p>

<p class="figh">Rembrandt, <em class="calibre5">Saint Paul in Prison (Scala/Art Resource, NY)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">In general, the impression one gets from Paul’s letters is not so much of three distinct missionary journeys, each ending with a visit to Jerusalem, as it is of a general westward movement, beginning in Syria and Cilicia at the eastern end of the Mediterranean basin (Gal 1:21), and then moving on to Asia Minor (Ephesus, 1 Cor 16:8), Greece (Thessalonica, Philippi, Corinth), and the area lying north of Greece (Illyricum, Rom 15:19). And then Paul proposes, after a visit to Rome, to continue his missionary proclamation in Spain (Rom 15:23–24).</p>
<p class="calibre8">While Paul clearly anticipated possible trouble during his final visit to Jerusalem (e.g., Rom 15:31), we have no report from him in any of his letters of the actual events. While some scholars have proposed that the letter to the Philippian Christians, composed when Paul was a prisoner, was written following his arrest in Jerusalem, there is nothing in the letter to make such a conclusion anything more than <a id="pg294" class="calibre3"></a>speculation. There is an old tradition that Peter and Paul were both martyred under Nero in Rome, perhaps during the persecution of Christians in Rome in 64 <small class="calibre9">C.E.</small>, Peter by crucifixion and Paul by beheading (Roman citizens were not crucified).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Clearly enough, Paul the missionary covered a large area, traveling by ship when possible, by foot when necessary, undergoing immense hardships in the course of his journeys. Acts mentions a number of imprisonments and some severe physical abuse in the form of beatings and a stoning, but they are outnumbered in Paul’s own catalog (2 Cor 11:23–27), written at what must have been about midway through his career. He enumerates five beatings with a lash, three with rods, and a stoning, some of which left him near death. He mentions three shipwrecks, one of which left him adrift a night and a day at sea, and mentions the kind of hardships any traveler would experience who undertook the kind of journeys that characterized Paul’s missionary career.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Both Paul’s letters and the accounts of his missionary activity in Acts point to one who traveled tirelessly to announce the good news of God’s saving act in Christ. He covered incredible distances under the most trying of circumstances, always pressing on to new areas where the gospel had not been proclaimed while at the same time displaying great pastoral care for the Christian communities he had already founded. It is therefore not surprising that a large portion of our NT is devoted to letters bearing his name.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch11ah03"><a href="part0002.html#rch11ah03" class="calibre6">11.3. PAUL’S INTELLECTUAL WORLD</a></p>
<p class="pf">It is clear that Paul, born and educated a Jew and at home in the secular world of the Mediterranean basin, was exposed to many and varied intellectual currents in the course of his youth and mature life. Although he is remembered as quoting a secular author on only one occasion (Aratus, <em class="calibre5">Phaenomena</em> 5, in Acts 17:28) he uses vocabulary associated with the popularized Platonism that characterized much of the intellectual framework of the Greco-Roman world (e.g., the contrast between flesh and spirit in Rom 8:9–13) and reflects the attitude of indifference to worldly relationships often urged by Stoic philosophers (e.g., 1 Cor 7:29–31; 2 Cor 6:10). Yet Paul puts that vocabulary and those attitudes in a framework that is quite different from those of the secular world, so that it is clear that he has not drawn the categories informing and organizing his thought from such sources. And it was in fact hard to speak of the structure of reality or the form of morality without using words that other thinkers had used when discussing similar points. Human vocabulary is finite, and it is not unusual for people with widely differing understandings of reality to use similar vocabulary to make their points. For that reason, similarities in vocabulary or in descriptions of morality do not point to dependence on others who use similar words or thought forms.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg295" class="calibre3"></a>Far more often than he cited secular thinkers or used their vocabulary, Paul cited the Jewish Scriptures and reflected Jewish ways of thinking. He was after all steeped in the Scriptures as a result of his training as a Pharisee, and he turns again and again to them to clarify or reinforce a point. In his discussions of law and covenant (Gal 3:17; 2 Cor 3:6) Paul clearly employs vocabulary and concepts familiar to Pharisaic thought, and his concern for entering and remaining in a right relationship with God reflects the very core of the Pharisee’s approach to both covenant and law. Yet influenced though he was by those thought patterns, Paul had expressly given up on such an approach to the way humans are to be related in a positive way to a just and merciful God. If he continues to use concepts and vocabulary derived from his Pharisaic background, he does so in a framework quite different from the one in which he would have used them as a Pharisee.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The mode of Jewish thinking closest to Paul’s outlook as a Christian apostle, from which he derived the structure of his thought, can best be characterized as apocalyptic. Such thinking was characterized by the notion that the present world and its culture were so unqualifiedly evil that nothing about them could be redeemed. The only way redemption could occur would be by means of a new creation, in which the very structures of reality would be altered and a new reality introduced. Because apocalyptic thinkers thought in terms of history, they tended to call the two shapes of reality the old and the new “age,” the Greek word for which has come down into English as “aeon.” Thus, the old aeon would come to an end and the new aeon would be inaugurated by God. In order to determine who could participate in the new aeon, the final event of the old aeon would be a universal judgment, during which God would determine would deserved entry into the new aeon. Since many people had died before this judgment, these thinkers argued that in order for justice to prevail and for everyone to be given the same chance, there would be a general resurrection just prior to the final judgment, so that everyone would be placed under the same judgment and thus have an equal chance to enter the new age.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul adopted this way of understanding reality because at the time of his conversion he was convinced that God had raised Jesus from the dead. In fact, Jesus’ resurrection constitutes the very center of the Christian faith for Paul (cf. 1 Cor 15:14, 17; Rom 10:9). Since the apocalyptic way of looking at reality was the only mode of thinking in the ancient world in which resurrection played a key role, it was inevitable that Paul would adopt it — but also adapt it. He speaks, therefore, of “aeons” (Rom 12:2; 1 Cor 2:6; 2 Cor 4:3; Gal 1:4), but he sees the contrast between the two ages, old and new, in terms of Adam and Christ (e.g., Rom 5:12–17; 1 Cor 15:21–22). Christ, by his death and resurrection, undoes the sin introduced by Adam with his disobedience of God. Christ thus also becomes the one through whom others may share in the resurrection and the new reality (see 1 Cor 15:13–28, 35–55; 1 Thess 4:14–17). Perhaps most importantly, Paul adapted the idea of <a id="pg296" class="calibre3"></a>the succession of the old and new ages. The resurrection of Christ, as Paul saw it, signaled the beginning of the new age, yet the general resurrection and the universal judgment had not taken place at that time, as Jewish apocalyptic would have expected with the transition from old to new age. Paul therefore saw that the end of the old and the beginning of the new overlapped, with the new age beginning with Christ’s resurrection, but the old age not coming to its conclusion until the return of Christ and the general resurrection.</p>

<p class="calibre8">It is in this time of the overlapping of the ages that we now live, a time in which the redemptive powers of the new age and the sinful and destructive powers of the old age exist and function side by side. The task of the Christian is, therefore, to trust in Christ by confessing him as Lord and doing what he taught people to do and to become part of the Christian community, which is, as it were, a colony of those whose true home is the new age but who now are still forced to live in the midst of the old age (e.g., Phil 4:20). The transformation of reality will mean that the basic structural element will be spirit, not matter; risen Christians will have spiritual bodies that have been delivered from the powers of the old age, namely sin and death (Phil 4:21; 1 Cor 15:42–55). It is in the communities of those <a id="pg297" class="calibre3"></a>who confess Christ as Lord and look to him for their redemption that the new power of the Spirit is already at work. Having entered that community by dying to the old age and to sin by being baptized into Christ, Christians henceforth live within the new reality and are given power to resist the old ways, which lead only to more sin and death (e.g., 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15; Rom 6:5–14). Trusting in Christ and living lives acceptable to God, Christians will be sustained in the final judgment and will enter into the new age with Christ, who by his death and resurrection has opened the way for those born in the age of Adam to participate in the restructured, spiritual reality.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Such is the message Paul announced to the world through which he moved, and it is to those who accepted that message and who determined to live by it that Paul addressed his letters, urging them to continue in their new way of life and to avoid the kind of actions that would deny them the advantages of sharing in the death and resurrection of Christ. We will need to look carefully at the kind of problems Paul faced and the ways he sought to meet them as we examine his letters.</p>
