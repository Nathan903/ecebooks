<p class="bhaft" id="ch23ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch23ah01" class="calibre6">23.1. THE SETTING OF THE EPISTLES OF JOHN</a></p>
<p class="pf">In its struggle to define itself over against the religious and philosophical movements of the ancient world, the emerging Christian movement was no stranger to conflict and controversy. As we have seen in the case of the Pauline churches, conflicts often arose within the Christian community regarding the appropriate beliefs and practices of those who called themselves followers of Jesus Christ. The epistles of John are the literary testimony to, and deposit of, such a disagreement, apparently so intense that it led ultimately to the rupture of the community. Indeed, the rupture may well have been inevitable, since the issues at stake lay at the very heart and soul of the Christian faith. Among the debated issues were the identity of Jesus Christ, the significance of his death, the nature of salvation, and the shape of Christian discipleship. As we shall see, the exact shape of the problems that these three short epistles seek to address resists anything more than a tentative reconstruction. Nevertheless, the internal evidence of the epistles themselves, coupled with data drawn from some other ancient writings, allows us to offer some more specific hypotheses concerning the conflicts and problems within the Johannine community that these epistles seek to address.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In 1 John the author remains anonymous, whereas in 2 and 3 John the author identifies himself as “the Elder,” and the recipients are named as “the elect lady and her children” (2 John) and Gaius (3 John). A perusal of the three epistles suggests that 1 and 2 John were written to address the same issues, whereas 3 John, although likely written at about the same time and by the same author, was written to deal with a different problem. The stylistic data suggests that the three letters could well have been authored by the same person. The following scenario offers a <a id="pg536" class="calibre3"></a>plausible explanation for how the letters are related: 1 John is a pastoral treatise, written to and circulated among a number of churches. 2 John was a cover letter sent with it to a specific but unnamed church. 3 John was sent, along with the other two, specifically to Gaius, who was probably a leader in the church that had received the other two letters. For the sake of convenience, the author is often called “the Elder,” even though this designation is not used in 1 John, and it is not certain that all three epistles were written by the same author.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letters provide evidence of a community consisting of a network of smaller congregations that sprang from the same source and belonged more or less loosely together, much as one speaks of the “Pauline mission churches.” In this case, scholars speak of “the Johannine community” because the primary literary deposit of their beliefs and struggles comes from the so-called Johannine literature of the NT. Traditionally, this category has included the Gospel of John, the three epistles of John, and the book of Revelation. But whereas the Gospel and letters share similar themes, theological concerns, and a common idiom, Revelation is different enough both literarily and theologically that it is difficult to assign it with certainty to the circle of churches whose Christian faith was expressed in and nurtured by the Gospel and epistles of John.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letters were probably written after the Gospel to deal with problems that had arisen in the church. According to later church tradition, the author of all four documents was the apostle John; hence, his name was assigned to the Gospel and the letters, which come to us anonymously. Today we use that traditional designation when we speak of “the Johannine community” and “the Johannine literature.” But a better understanding of these letters and the situation that they addressed can be gleaned from studying these documents on their own terms rather than from speculation about their unnamed author or authors, who remain largely unknown to us in any case.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch23ah02"><a href="part0002.html#rch23ah02" class="calibre6">23.2. THE CONFLICT: DATA FROM THE EPISTLES</a></p>
<p class="pf">Both 1 and 2 John repeatedly emphasize the importance of adhering to that which “you have heard from the beginning,” including particularly the commandment to love each other (1 John 1:1; 2:7, 24; 3:11; 2 John 5–6). Each epistle refers to “deceivers who have gone out into the world,” characterizing them as “liars,” “antichrists” and “false prophets,” who speak by the power of the “spirit of error” (1 John 2:18–22, 26; 4:1–6; 2 John 7). Of great concern to the author is that his readers persist in holding onto and living out the truth that they have been taught (1 John 1:6; 2:4, 8, 21, 26–27; 3:18–19; 4:6; 5:20; 2 John 1–4). Clearly, the author views the teaching and practice of these false prophets as a threat to the proper understanding of truth and to the well-being of his readers. What, then, is <a id="pg537" class="calibre3"></a>the scope and content of the teaching against which our author issues such stern warnings?</p>
<p class="calibre8">A host of statements in the epistles can be pieced together in an effort to characterize the teaching of the false prophets. The author warns his readers against claiming to be without sin (1 John 1:8–2:2); he chastises those who claim to know God, but disobey God’s commandments (1:6–7; 2:4–6; 5:2–3), or who claim to love God, but do not love their brothers and sisters (2:7–11; 3:10–18, 23; 4:7–11, 20–21); he cautions against loving the world and warns against its power and allure (1 John 2:15–17; 4:4–6; 5:19). These admonitions focus on the way of life of those who claim to be Christians, suggesting that the author and his community are at odds with these false prophets about the shape of the life of discipleship. Do Christian believers continue to sin? Must they keep the commandments of God? What should be their relationship to “the world”?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Alongside statements that point to the conflict over the nature of the Christian life, there are a series of statements that indicate an equally serious disagreement about the person of Jesus Christ. These statements include the following: “Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?” (1 John 2:22; 5:1); “this is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son” (2:22); “every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God” (4:2; 2 John 7); “every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God” (1 John 4:3); “God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God” (4:15; 5:5, 10, 13); “This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood” (5:6). Together these statements yield a list of what the author urges his readers to confess and believe: Jesus is “the Messiah”; he has “come in the flesh”; he is the Son of God; he “came by water and blood.” In simplest terms, they are to “confess Jesus.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">But what is the relationship of all these statements to each other? And what were the false prophets saying or teaching? Not only is recognition of Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah, foundational to understanding the nature of his mission, but early in the church’s life it formed the heart of confession of Jesus. Indeed, it is hard to imagine “Christians” who did not acknowledge that Jesus is “the Christ.” Hence, the more specific affirmations that Jesus had come “in the flesh” and that he came “by water and blood” likely point to the author’s concrete concerns with respect to the teachers whom he wished to discredit. The precise contours of their false teaching are lost to us and can only be reconstructed by trying to puzzle out why the author of the epistles makes these various affirmations. But it is clear that the essence of the dispute centers not on whether Jesus is the Messiah, but rather on the proper way to construe what that means, as interpretative clauses such as “Jesus Christ <em class="calibre5">come in the flesh</em>” demonstrate. This particular confession gets close to the heart of what the author confesses and his opponents deny, for he stresses quite emphatically the reality of Jesus’ existence: “what we have seen with our eyes, <a id="pg538" class="calibre3"></a>what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life . . . we have seen it and testify to it . . . we declare to you what we have seen and heard . . .” (1 John 1:1–3).</p>
<p class="calibre8">There are other affirmations about the person, life, and death of Jesus that help shed light on the false teaching by adding another aspect to our understanding of it. In a number of places, the author puts special stress on the forgiveness of sins that comes through Jesus. His death “cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7); he is the “atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world” (2:2); he appeared to take away sin (3:5) and to “destroy the works of the devil” (3:8). This work was accomplished ultimately through his death, a fact that seems to require both renewed emphasis and interpretation for the readers. The author reminds his readers that Jesus “laid down his life for us” (3:16) and that he came “not with water only, but with the water and the blood” (5:6). “Blood” is a shorthand term for Jesus’ death, and the reality and significance of Jesus’ death seem to be among the disputed items as well.</p>
<p class="calibre8">From this data taken from the epistles it is not a simple step to a full-scale characterization of the author’s opponents and their beliefs. But we get significant assistance from other literature of the time that helps us locate this false teaching on the map of beliefs in the ancient world. In particular, the writings of the church fathers Ignatius, from the early second century, and Irenaeus, from the late second century, give us evidence of heresies that bear some striking similarities to those apparently being combated in 1 and 2 John. A look at selections from their writings will serve to shed some light on the issues in the Johannine community.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch23ah03"><a href="part0002.html#rch23ah03" class="calibre6">23.3. HISTORICAL PARALLELS AND THE SHAPE OF THE FALSE TEACHING</a></p>
<p class="pf">The false teaching combated by the author of 1 John with emphatic statements like “By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God” (1 John 4:2; 2 John 7) seems to be related to the Docetism that Ignatius argued against in the early second century. But the beliefs of those who had left the Johannine community, often called “the secessionists,” do not seem as fully developed as the Docetism of Ignatius’s letters or of the Gnostic systems attacked by later church fathers (see “Gnosticism” on pp. 412–13 above). The letters of Ignatius and of John show that varying views of the nature of Jesus’ human existence already competed for ascendancy in the first century of the church’s life, views that would later be taken up into fully developed Gnostic thought. These theories tended to minimize, if not utterly deny, the reality of Jesus’ flesh and humanity. By denying the reality of the incarnation of Jesus, they struck at the very heart of the confession, found in the Gospel of John, that “the Word <a id="pg540" class="calibre3"></a>became flesh and lived among us” (John 1:14). 1 and 2 John reaffirm this fundamental conviction with the assertion, “he came in the flesh.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh"><a id="pg539" class="calibre6"></a>Ignatius on Docetism</p>
<p class="sbaft">Ignatius was a bishop of the church of Antioch in Syria in the early second century who was martyred in Rome <em class="calibre5">ca.</em> 110. During his journey from Antioch to Rome under Roman guard, he wrote letters to churches primarily in the region of Asia Minor, including some mentioned in the NT — those in Ephesus, Philadelphia, Smyrna, and Rome — and also to the churches in Magnesia and Tralles. And he wrote a letter to Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna in the first half of the second century.</p>
<p class="sb">In several of these letters Ignatius wrote vehemently against a heresy now called “Docetism.” The term comes from the Greek word <em class="calibre5">dokein,</em> which means “to seem”: those Ignatius wrote against held that Christ only <em class="calibre5">seemed</em> to have a genuine body of flesh and to suffer and die. Ignatius wrote that they refused to confess Jesus as <em class="calibre5">sarkophoros,</em> literally “flesh-bearer” (<em class="calibre5">Smyrneans</em> 5.2). He insisted in response that Jesus’ birth, suffering, and resurrection were real historical events (<em class="calibre5">Magnesians</em> 11) and that Jesus’ death and resurrection occurred “in the flesh” (<em class="calibre5">Smyrneans</em> 1.2; 3.1). Furthermore,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">[Jesus] suffered all these things for us that we might attain salvation, and he truly suffered even as also truly raised himself, not as some unbelievers say, that he only seemed to suffer. . . . (<em class="calibre5">Smyrneans</em> 2)</p>
<p class="sbbqf">There is one Physician, who is both flesh and spirit, born and yet not born, who is God in man, true life in death, both of Mary and of God, first suffering and then not suffering, Jesus Christ our Lord. (<em class="calibre5">Ephesians</em> 7.2)</p>
<p class="bqs">But if, as some affirm who are without God — that is, unbelievers — he only seemed to suffer (but it is they who only seem to be!), why am I a prisoner, and why do I even long to fight with the beasts? In that case I am dying in vain. (<em class="calibre5">Trallians</em> 10)</p>
</div>
<p class="sbo">Since the epistles of John are generally dated to the end of the first century and often located in the region of Asia Minor and, more specifically, in Ephesus, it is easy to imagine that the Docetism that Ignatius opposed was related in some way to the false teaching combated by the author of 1 John.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">This leads us to two questions about the struggles in the Johannine church that led to its division. First, how could some members of a community that knew of the incarnation of the Word as recorded in the Fourth Gospel have been led to beliefs about Jesus and his incarnation that seem tantamount to an outright denial of that incarnation? Second, what was the relationship between this denial of Jesus’ incarnation and the views of Christian discipleship held by the dissidents?</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is striking that at least one Gnostic document contains the claim that the Gnostic believers “have never sinned” <em class="calibre5">(Second Treatise of the Great Seth),</em> a claim rejected by the author of 1 John (1:8–2:2). In another Gnostic treatise, <em class="calibre5">The Gospel of Mary,</em> the risen Jesus tells Peter that sin is not a moral failing but a problem arising from the mixing of the spiritual and material realms. Again, 1 John stresses that sin and righteousness are manifested in morality, in concrete conduct. It may be that those who left the Johannine community valued the heavenly and spiritual realm and despised physical matter in such a way that it led them to lay all their emphasis on the heavenly Christ rather than the human Jesus and on their own “spiritual” status as the children of God rather than their day-to-day actions. They had attained their heavenly and spiritual status already in this life and did not need to wait for it. They were, in fact, no longer subject to the evils of this world; as those born of God, they were righteous like Jesus (2:1–2; 3:2) and God, whose children they were (3:1–3). They had been “born from above” by the power of “water and the Spirit” and belonged no longer to this world but to the world above. Just as Jesus came down from heaven, so they had been taken up to the heavenly realms. Taken to its extreme end, such a view evacuates the future of any promise of transformation, since that transformation has occurred now and decisively in this life. The perfection promised for the future belongs to the children of God now, leading them to claim “we have no sin.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">Incarnation and ethics were thus inextricably linked together. If one disregards the significance of Jesus’ incarnation, life, and death, it follows rather naturally that one will disregard the significance of all human life. The affirmations that Jesus “came in the flesh” testify to the significance of human life, whether it be Jesus’ life or that of his followers.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The differences in views regarding Jesus, his incarnation, and ultimately the whole basis of the Christian life led to irreconcilable differences between two factions in the Johannine community, and some left the community. The author of the epistles interprets their departure as evidence that they were committed to a fundamentally different understanding of the Christian faith: “They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us” (1 John 2:19; 2 John 7). They had not remained faithful to the <a id="pg541" class="calibre3"></a>understanding of the faith that had been handed down to them “from the beginning” (1 John 1:1; 2:7, 24; 3:11; 2 John 1:5–6) but had gone “beyond it” (2 John 9). Their departure also showed their failure to obey God’s command to believe in Jesus and the basic command that Jesus himself had given them, that they love their brothers and sisters (1 John 3:23), even though they claimed to be without sin.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">“We Have Not Sinned”</p>
<p class="sbaft">The Gnostic document called <em class="calibre5">The Second Treatise of the Great Seth</em> contains a litany of persons and acts deemed sinful by the Gnostics, interspersed with the refrain “We have not sinned.” The “Hebdomad” in the text below is an emanation or divine being in Gnostic cosmology.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">For Adam was a laughingstock, since he was made a counterfeit type of man by the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. We are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned. And Abraham and Isaac and Jacob were a laughingstock, since they, the counterfeit fathers, were given a name by the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. We are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned. David was a laughingstock in that his son was named the Son of Man, having been influenced by the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and the fellow members of my race. But we are innocent with respect to him; we have not sinned. Solomon was a laughingstock, since he thought that he was Christ, having become vain through the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him. I have not sinned. The prophets were laughingstocks, since they have come forth as imitations of the true prophets. They came into being as counterfeits through the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned. (Nag Hammadi codices VII.62.27–63.26; translation from James M. Robinson, ed., <em class="calibre5">The Nag Hammadi Library</em> [revised ed.; San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1988])</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">1 and 2 John aim to reassert and reaffirm, in light of threats from the false teachers and the disruption caused by the split within the church, the teaching that the author and his community had received “from the beginning.” While the little <a id="pg542" class="calibre3"></a>epistle of 2 John alludes to the problem, 1 John constitutes the Elder’s arguments for his understanding of the faith over against that of his opponents. 3 John treats a problem that has been created by this situation. Most likely these epistles would not have been read by those who had already left the church. They were intended primarily for those who had remained with the community. 1 John in particular has the dual function of exposing falsehood but also encouraging and reassuring the readers of the genuineness of their faith, and exhorting them to faithfulness and perseverance in it. No doubt the split within the community had caused many to question their own standing as God’s children, to wonder whether they had failed to come to a full experience and understanding of their Christian existence. The Elder thus not only wishes to proclaim once more the truth as he himself has heard it, but to call to mind the richness of the experience of love, fellowship, forgiveness, and joy that has marked their life of faith.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch23ah04"><a href="part0002.html#rch23ah04" class="calibre6">23.4. 1 JOHN</a></p>
<p class="pf">Although we refer to 1 John as a letter or epistle, it actually bears none of the marks of ancient correspondence. It does not name its recipients, it begins with no greeting or wish for health, and it contains no closing. It has been variously labeled a circular epistle, a tract, a sermon, a treatise, or a pastoral manual, and some have even suggested that it is a compilation of sermons or parts of sermons or letters. If 1 John were a composite document, that might explain the difficulty readers have had in tracing the development of thought and argument and in detecting a transparent structure. The epistle seems to begin almost in the middle of a thought without a proper introduction, it frequently returns to and repeats previous themes, it does not always manifest transitions between sections, and it ends abruptly with the cryptic exhortation, “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” Unlike other NT authors, such as Luke, Paul, or the author of Hebrews, the Elder is given neither to rhetorical flourish, intricate exegetical arguments, nor literary device and style. In his straightforward and unadorned manner, he summarizes his central pastoral concerns for the well-being of his flock, for their understanding of the significance of Jesus’ life and death on their behalf, and for their life together in Christian fellowship and love, which together yield the fruit of joy.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The theological and pastoral themes that provide the epistle’s center of gravity are hallmarks of the Johannine tradition, particularly as given expression in John 14–17, the “Farewell Discourses.” There Jesus gives his final instructions to his disciples, exhorting them to love each other (John 13:34–35; 14:21–24; 15:13–17; 1 John 3:11–18; 4:7–12, 16–21; 5:1–3), to heed the teaching of the Holy Spirit (John 14:25–26; 15:26–27; 16:13–15; 1 John 2:26–27; 4:1–7, 13), to dwell in unity with God and each other through the work of Jesus Christ (John 14:20, 23; <a id="pg543" class="calibre3"></a>15:1–11; 17:21–23; 1 John 1:3), to be on their guard against the pressures and hatred of the world (John 15:18–23; 16:31–33; 17:11; 1 John 2:15–17; 5:4–5, 19), and to live in the joy and peace given to them by Jesus (John 14:1, 27; 15:11; 16:20–24; 20:19–21; 1 John 1:4; 3:19–22). The epistle applies these themes to the problems now facing the Johannine community.</p>

<p class="calibre8">1 John was likely written, then, after the Gospel of John to deal with problems that had arisen in the community sometime later. Of course, the two documents can be difficult to compare, since the Gospel presents a narrative of some of the words and deeds of Jesus, whereas the epistle contains the exhortations and admonitions of an early Christian teacher and pastor. Even so, important differences may be detected. The Gospel aims to encourage faith in Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God (John 20:31). Jesus is presented in the symbols of Judaism (temple, law, Moses, prophet, Passover) as the fulfillment of God’s promises to the people of Israel. But these symbols scarcely appear in 1 John, which lacks OT citations, references to Jewish feasts or customs, and arguments regarding Jesus’ <a id="pg544" class="calibre3"></a>messianic role. As we have suggested, those who fell within the dissident faction so stressed the divine aspect of Jesus’ person that they neglected his human life and death. This is almost, ironically, the opposite of the problem in the Gospel itself, where the well-known earthly origins of Jesus present a stumbling block to the claims made for and by him: “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (1:46) and “How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” (6:42). The ordinariness of his human life mocks claims for his exalted status. But in the epistles, not only the significance but also the reality of that human life disappear into Docetic conceptions of Jesus. Put differently, whereas the Gospel declares that Jesus is the <em class="calibre5">Messiah, the Son of God,</em> 1 John insists that the Messiah, the Son of God, is <em class="calibre5">Jesus</em>.</p>
<p class="ah">23.4.1. Witness to the Truth</p>
<p class="pf">Evidence of both the problem plaguing the author’s community and his response to that problem surfaces in the very first sentence of the letter, where the Elder bears testimony to the historical reality and significance of the events surrounding Jesus’ life. In the first four verses, the Elder speaks of “what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked upon and touched with our hands concerning the word of life” and asserts, “we have seen it and testify to it,” and “we declare to you what we have seen and heard” (cf. 4:14). The “we” in this series of statements is, of course, the author and those who support him in one way or another. This group emphasizes its continuity with eyewitness testimony to and about Jesus’ life and mission. But nowhere does the Elder call attention to himself, speak of himself as an “apostle” or as one of “the Twelve,” or tell us his name. What he does stress is a specific task, that of “testifying” and “declaring.” Thus he calls attention to the reality and truth to which he bears witness. He functions in the role of a witness, a role honored by the Johannine community and variously assigned in the Fourth Gospel to the Baptist (John 1:6–8, 15, 32–34; 3:26; 5:33), the Samaritan woman (4:39), the Scriptures (5:39), the Spirit (15:26), the Father (5:37; 8:18), Jesus (3:11) and Jesus’ works (5:36; 10:25). But in the Gospel, these witnesses testify to Jesus as the Messiah, the one sent by God; in 1 John, the author and his fellow Christians bear testimony to the historical reality of the events of Jesus’ life and death, well aware that others see those events differently and, hence, do not listen to them (4:6; cf. John 3:11). Because of the competing interpretations of the traditions about Jesus, the author exhorts his readers to “test the spirits” by the confession that “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” (4:2), declaring that the Spirit and God (5:7–12) together confirm the author’s testimony to the life and death of Jesus.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus the active verbs — have heard, have seen, testify, declare — characterize <a id="pg545" class="calibre3"></a>the role of the witness in the court of law. In ancient Jewish courts, judges passed the verdicts based on the evidence borne by the witnesses who appeared before them. Here the author is the witness and the readers are the judges who will either credit or discredit the testimony offered. Thus the Elder’s authority lies in his role and function as a witness, which in turn depends on the reality of that which he has seen and heard and the truth to which he bears witness. Not only does he offer his testimony to what he has seen and heard, but he wishes to offer a persuasive interpretation of that reality, an interpretation that, he argues, has been consistent <em class="calibre5">from the beginning</em>.</p>
<p class="ah">23.4.2. The Significance of Jesus’ Life and Death</p>
<p class="pf">Specifically, the core of the author’s witness has to do with the reality of Jesus’ life and the meaning of his death. While the author affirms the reality, even the palpability of the events of the life of Jesus, the epistle does not actually mention any of the specific deeds or activities of Jesus except his death. For example, none of the signs is recounted or adduced as evidence for Jesus’ identity, nor are the signs even mentioned. Except for the command to love one another, the words of Jesus play no significant part in the epistle. These absences do not suggest that the Elder was uninterested in these aspects of Jesus’ life, but rather that the focal point of concern was the very fact of Jesus’ life and the meaning of his death.</p>
<p class="calibre8">That the meaning of Jesus’ life and death belong together is illustrated already in the Gospel of John. Beginning with the resounding affirmation “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us,” the Gospel goes on to speak of Jesus’ flesh in terms of his sacrificial death: “And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh” (John 6:51–58). Here, too, Jesus insists that “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.” These very graphic statements speak of Jesus’ life-giving death in terms of his giving of his “flesh” <em class="calibre5">(sarx)</em> and “blood.” This emphasis on the need for Jesus’ death is picked up in 1 John, for apparently that very need had been disputed. For, as noted earlier, where there is no sin there is no need of atonement, and apparently certain members of the Johannine community had begun to claim that as children of God, they no longer sinned. The author of 1 John argued that they might as well deny their need for Jesus’ death. And to do so would be to flout the witness of the Spirit and of God. Obviously these views cannot exist as two expressions of truth, and eventually those who held them could no longer coexist in the community. Those who were not in agreement with the author left. Thereby they violated, according to the Elder, the two most fundamental commandments: they neither believed in the name of God’s son Jesus Christ nor loved one another (3:23). They ceased believing when they abandoned the truths about Jesus held and declared by the Elder <a id="pg546" class="calibre3"></a>and his supporters “from the beginning,” and they failed to love each other by their failure to maintain the unity of relationship within the family of God.</p>

<p class="sbh">Dualism</p>
<p class="sbaft">The following text from the Dead Sea Scrolls, with its sharp “dualism” between two “spirits,” no longer made it necessary to brand the dualism found in 1 John (and the Gospel of John) as “Greek” rather than “Jewish,” once it had been discovered and published. The contrast between light and darkness and righteousness and falsehood, the image of “walking” in the ways of truth and light, and the contrast between the two spirits are found also in 1 John.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">He has created man to govern the world, and has appointed for him two spirits in which to walk until the time of His visitation: the spirits of truth and falsehood. All the children of righteousness are ruled by the Prince of Light and walk in the ways of light, but all the children of falsehood are ruled by the Angel of Darkness and walk in the ways of darkness.</p>
<p class="sbbq">The Angel of Darkness leads all the children of righteousness astray; and until his end, all their sin, iniquities, wickedness, and all their unlawful deeds are caused by his dominion in accordance with the mysteries of God.</p>
<p class="sbbql">But the God of Israel and His Angel of Truth will succor all the sons of light. For it is He who created the spirits of Light and Darkness and founded every action upon them and established every deed [upon] their [ways]. (1QS 3:17–25, Vermes)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="ah">24.4.3. The Family of God</p>
<p class="pf">And, indeed, the language for believers is strikingly familial. Believers are “children of God” (<em class="calibre5">tekna tou theou,</em> 3:1), “born of God”; they confess God as “Father” (3:1); they are “brothers and sisters” to each other, and some even seem to have the designation “fathers” (2:13, 14); they inherit through Jesus, the Son of God (<em class="calibre5">huios tou theou,</em> 1:3; 2:22–25; cf. John 8:34–35). The Elder repeatedly addresses his flock as “little children” (<em class="calibre5">teknia,</em> 2:1, 12, 28; 3:7), and “beloved” (<em class="calibre5">agap<span class="dcrit">ē</span>toi,</em> 2:7; 3:2, 21; <a id="pg547" class="calibre3"></a>4:1, 7, 11; cf. 3 John 1, 2, 5, 11). The poignant scene at the cross in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus entrusts his mother and the “disciple whom he loved” to each other, establishes the new family that would be born, as Jesus warned, out of divisions within existing families. The Johannine community had already experienced such painful division as the Christian movement became ever more distinct from its Jewish roots, and now experienced it again as the community itself split over different understandings of the Christian faith. Whereas the familial imagery had once referred to the family created by Jesus’ call, as over against the natural family of Judaism, now the imagery was pressed into the service of designating those who remained faithful to that message that had been passed down from the beginning of the family’s existence.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But the family imagery may also provide useful evidence regarding the internal structure and organization of the Johannine community. Although the author refers to himself as “the Elder” in 2 and 3 John, there are no other traces in the epistle of offices or functions in the church, such as one finds hints of in Acts and the Pauline correspondence. A high premium is placed on the role of the Spirit, whose primary function is construed in terms of teaching and inspiring prophets to teach the truth. Undoubtedly those members of the community who had left it also claimed to be inspired by the Spirit. They may well have claimed that their understanding of the faith and teaching was the direct leading of the Spirit into deeper insights into Jesus and the meaning of his life and death. But, as the author of 1 John warns, the claim to have the Spirit does not automatically imply that one speaks by the power of that Spirit: “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world” (4:1). He then goes on to give one of two primary tests by which one can “know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God” (4:2–3). While the community acknowledged itself to be guided by the teaching and inspiration of the Spirit, which, according to Johannine tradition, “blows where it chooses” (John 3:8), nevertheless the work of the Spirit was understood to be circumscribed by the testimony of those who had witnessed, and now bore testimony to, the reality of Jesus’ life and death. The Spirit would not lead prophets into confessions and teaching that took the original testimony in such a fundamentally different direction.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch23ah05"><a href="part0002.html#rch23ah05" class="calibre6">23.5. 2 JOHN</a></p>
<p class="pf">The shortest of the NT writings, 2 John seems somewhat redundant after the lengthier and more developed first epistle. The contribution of 2 John to our understanding of early Christianity and the Christian faith lies not so much in its <a id="pg548" class="calibre3"></a>theological assertions, which are consistently more terse than those of 1 John, but in the framework it provides for reading 1 John. If in 1 John we see the problem from the vantage point of the church from which the false prophets “went out,” in 2 John we see the problem with the eyes of the church in which they may then have showed up to preach and teach. The purpose of 2 John is to deal with the problem of itinerant teachers whose heresies had been enumerated and condemned in 1 John (v. 7). How does the church treat those who had gone out teaching in ways contrary to the truth (vv. 7, 10, 11)?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Unlike 1 John, this letter opens in traditional form with the designation of the author (“the elder”) and the recipients (“the elect lady and her children”). And yet the identifications offered are unusual, for where one would typically expect personal names, here we have title and metaphor. Suffice it to say that the original readers knew full well who the Elder was, and the title suggests both a specific function within the church (Jas 5:14; 1 Pet 5:1; 1 Tim 5:17; Tit 1:5) and a position of authority. “The elect lady and her children” is likely a personification of a local church and its members; we would say “the church and its members,” even as Paul tells the church at Corinth, “You are the body of Christ and individually members of it” (1 Cor 12:27). Regularly in the Scriptures, the people of God are compared to <a id="pg549" class="calibre3"></a>a woman, the bride of Yahweh or Christ or God’s children (Isa 54:1, 13; Jer 6:21; 31:21; Lam 4:2–3; John 3:29; 2 Cor 11:2; Gal 4:25–26; Eph 5:23; Revelation 18–19). Again the image is familial. Even as John and 1 John speak of believers as “children of God” (e.g., John 1:13; 1 John 3:1–3) and “brothers and sisters” of each other, so here, too, the church is conceived of as a mother and her children. The elder writes to a specific house church some distance away to warn against the activities and teaching of a rival missionary group who have left the larger community.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Early Christian “House Churches”</p>
<p class="sbo">According to the NT, the earliest Christian believers gathered for fellowship and worship in private homes (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12). This was not a novel practice, but followed the pattern of contemporary Judaism. Archaeological excavations show that the “synagogues” of first-century Judaism were at first rooms in private residences. Later both Jews and Christians began to renovate private residences for the exclusive use of gathering together, so that the earliest buildings set aside strictly for worship and fellowship were originally private homes. Some archaeologists have suggested that a building at Capernaum that was renovated to serve as a gathering place for Christians was originally the home of Peter. The practice of using private homes continued until the growth of the Christian movement caused Christians to search for larger gathering places in public buildings, and until Emperor Constantine, in the early fourth century, recognized Christianity and extended freedom of worship to Christians. Constantine also generously sponsored building of structures dedicated exclusively to worship, particularly in Palestine, Rome, and Constantinople.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">In his greeting to the congregation, the Elder uses two words that become thematic throughout the epistle: love (vv. 1, 3, 5–6) and truth (vv. 1–4). According to the Elder, those who have left the church have failed to show love for their brothers and sisters, presumably by leaving the church. Hence, love and unity are closely related, even as they are in John 14–17, in Jesus’ discourses about the importance of loving one another and living in unity with each other and with God. Truth includes those matters of confession and practice that ought to characterize the Christian believer. Thus the author speaks not only of “knowing the truth” (v. 1) but also of “walking in the truth” (v. 4). The truth that they are to know has at its heart “the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh” (vv. 7–9; cf. 1 John 4:1–2). The traveling prophets, those who are “deceivers” and “antichrists” (v. 7), have shown <a id="pg550" class="calibre3"></a>by their false teaching about Christ, their misconstrual of the status of the Christian, and their departure from the Johannine community their failure both to “know” the truth and to “walk” in it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Elder’s admonitions about these false teachers are stern and unyielding: “Do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching” (v. 10). In fact the attitude manifested here has led scholars to paint a picture of a beleaguered and ingrown community that has turned increasingly inward upon itself. But the Elder’s command does not intend to promote hostility toward and separation from the world. Rather, the context of the epistle makes it clear that the house in question is the house church (v. 10). In other words, the Elder commands the church not to sanction false teaching by allowing the false teachers opportunity to speak. The church members are to test the spirits of the prophets (1 John 4:1–7) and, having tested them, to stand firmly for the truth.</p>

<p class="pf">3 John is also a genuine letter, but unlike 1 and 2 John it is a personal letter addressed to Gaius. The letter itself has three main purposes: the author commends Gaius and his practice of welcoming traveling prophets (vv. 5–8), criticizes the behavior of Diotrephes, who refuses to follow the practice of Gaius (vv. 9–10), and commends one of these prophets, Demetrius (v. 12). 3 John may well have been a letter of commendation for Demetrius to be carried by Demetrius himself (cf. Rom 16:1–2; 2 Cor 3:1–3).</p>
<p class="calibre8">To understand these commendations and condemnations, we need to place them in the context of Johannine church life. Because the larger community consisted of a number of smaller congregations scattered over an area wide enough to prohibit easy contact with the Elder, communication through letters and messengers such as Demetrius was crucial to maintaining contact and strengthening fellow believers. Apparently the Elder had sent out emissaries before, just as he was now sending Demetrius. But the rupture in the community over matters of belief and practice, resulting in the secession of some individuals, had complicated matters. Not only were there emissaries of the Elder, but those who had seceded from the community likely also maintained contacts in various congregations. They would have neither cut off all fellowship nor abandoned their own commitments to preaching and teaching their understanding of the faith. It might not have been easy to distinguish truth from error or the faithful from heretical teachers, especially since both sides may have used traditional confessional formulas, albeit with different interpretations.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Elder commends Gaius for “walking in the truth” (vv. 3–4) and, specifically within this letter, for welcoming the “brothers” (v. 5), sending them on their way “in a manner worthy of God” (v. 6), supporting them (vv. 7–8), and being their “coworkers in the truth” (v. 8). These “brothers” were probably itinerant teachers and emissaries of the Elder. The hospitality given them amounted to more than provision of room and board, as welcome as that would have been. The Elder is commending Gaius’s hospitality because it ensures the propagation of the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">On the other hand, the Elder condemns the attitude and activities of Diotrephes, whose offenses consist of refusing to acknowledge the Elder’s authority (v. 9), spreading false charges about the Elder (v. 10), and refusing to welcome those sent out, apparently by the Elder (v. 10). Moreover, although the Elder alludes to an earlier letter that he has written “to the church” (v. 9), perhaps to try to address some of the problems that figure in 1 and 2 John, that letter has been ignored, and Diotrephes, who, according to the Elder, “likes to put himself first” (v. 9), seems responsible. While it is tempting to think of Diotrephes as one of the heretical teachers who has left the community, the Elder never criticizes Diotrephes with respect to his <a id="pg552" class="calibre3"></a>faith or teaching. It seems unlikely that these would have gone unmentioned had the Elder known of any heretical inclinations held by Diotrephes. That Diotrephes has set himself against the Elder seems clear; why he has done so, whether out of personal spite or deeply held convictions, remains unclear. But he must have been a person of some influence in the church in order to prevent the Elder’s letter from getting a proper hearing, to refuse a welcome to those itinerant teachers, to prevent others from doing so, and even to go so far as to “expel them from the church” (v. 10). While the Elder proposes a visit to deal with the problem, he encourages Gaius to persist in his course and resist Diotrephes’ pressure. Demetrius can be expected to assist Gaius if Gaius will welcome the Elder’s emissary and adhere to the truth that he proclaims.</p>

<p class="sbh">Discerning the Prophets</p>
<p class="sbaft">Itinerant teachers and preachers were not uncommon in the early Christian movement. These quotations from the <em class="calibre5">Didache,</em> which is from the second century, show the difficulty and necessity of discerning the true prophet from the false prophet:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">Let every apostle who comes to you be received as the Lord, but let him not stay more than one day, or if need be a second as well; but if he stay three days, he is a false prophet. (11:4–5)</p>
<p class="sbbqf">Not everyone who speaks in a spirit is a prophet, unless he has the behavior of the Lord. From his behavior, then, the false prophet and the true prophet shall be known. (11:8)</p>
<p class="bqs">Let everyone who comes in the name of the Lord be received. . . . If he who comes is a traveler, help him as much as you can, but he shall not remain with you more than two days, or, if need be, three. (12:1–2)</p>
