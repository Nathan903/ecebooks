<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch16" class="calibre6">Paul and the Christians in Philippi</a></p>
<p class="pf">The letter to the Philippians is basically a thank you note to the Christians in Philippi, who have (again) sent Paul a gift of money to support his missionary activity. It is by turns irenic, autobiographical, and polemical. It reveals Paul in all his multidimensional reality, by turns stern teacher, beloved friend, and personal confidant. It gives us perhaps our most intimate glimpse at the apostle to the Gentiles, whose burning conviction that God in Christ has acted to redeem a world rotten with sin drove him relentlessly over long distances to announce that good news to all who would listen.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Few serious scholars have challenged the authorship of this letter; it is almost universally recognized as having been written by Paul to his converts in the Christian community of the city of Philippi. In 356 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>, when Philip II of Macedonia, the father of Alexander the Great, annexed the area in which the settlement was located, he renamed it after himself — hence Philippi. It was conquered by the Romans some two centuries later (168–67 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>) and became an important way station on the Via Egnatia, a Roman road connecting northwestern Asia with ports on the Adriatic Sea. In 42 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> Mark Antony refounded Philippi as a Roman colony and settled veterans of his army there. Augustus refounded it yet once more after the battle of Actium (31 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>) and settled more of his veterans there. Essentially a Roman outpost, the city was governed by the so-called “Italian law” (Latin <em class="calibre5">lex Italicum</em>), which was reserved for the most honored of Roman provincial cities. Although the local language was Greek, Philippi was probably the most latinized of the cities in which Paul established Christian communities. While Paul says nothing of the circumstances surrounding his original visit to Philippi, Acts recounts the difficulties Paul (and Timothy, see Acts 16:3–5) experienced during their proclamation of the gospel there (16:11–39), the first time evangelization had been attempted on European territory.</p>

<p class="calibre8">While there seems to have been some sort of conflict within the Philippian church (e.g., 4:2; cf. 1:27; 2:2) and some threat of people from the outside bringing what Paul regarded as a perverted gospel (e.g., 3:2–3), as in Galatia, the main purpose of the letter seems to be to thank the Christians in Philippi for the gift of money they sent to Paul (4:10–19). He also wants to assure the Philippian Christians that Epaphroditus, the courier they sent with the gift, who had fallen ill and then recovered, had in fact represented them faithfully during his time with Paul (2:25–30).</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch16ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch16ah01" class="calibre6">16.1. THE LETTER</a></p>
<p class="pf">Despite the relatively limited content of the letter — it comprises only four chapters — it nevertheless gives us one of our best chances to examine what Paul understood about the significance of the career of Christ (2:6–11) and what he understood his own conversion to be about (3:4–16). All of this is couched in a letter that wants to provide reassurance about a member of the Philippian community who had come to Paul and become ill, and to thank that community for their support for Paul’s missionary endeavors. It shows us the extent to which Paul’s whole <a id="pg393" class="calibre3"></a>life and thought was wrapped around the task incumbent upon him as an apostle of Jesus Christ.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre8">The letter opening (1:1–2) is one of the briefest in the Pauline corpus. It simply identifies the letter’s senders (Paul and Timothy) and recipients and concludes with a typical Pauline salutation. What is unique here is the reference to the “bishops and deacons” at Philippi. Some have suggested that this may be a later addition, since the notion of the bishop as the chief Christian official is not really emphasized until the letters of Ignatius of Antioch, who wrote at the end of the first century or the beginning of the second. Yet the word translated “bishop” simply means “overseer,” and the word for “deacon” means “one who serves,” so in themselves they need not yet be technical terms for orders of clergy. The organization of the earliest church was apparently quite fluid, and the presence of church leaders called bishops and deacons in one place does not mean the terms were used in all places by this time. Both are also mentioned in 1 Timothy, and the bishop in Titus, but they are absent from the other Pauline letters. Thus it is much more likely that the Philippians had begun to use words to designate the leaders of their Christian community that over time would be adopted more generally by the church, rather than that we have here evidence for an already firm order of church officials.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul, as is typical for him, follows the letter opening with a thanksgiving (1:3–11). In Philippians it reflects the support his readers have given him from the time <a id="pg394" class="calibre3"></a>he first arrived in their city and the real affection he feels for them as a result. There is some evidence that the words Paul uses to describe his current status (1:7), namely his “defense” and “confirmation” of the gospel, may be technical legal terms for the part of his trial in which he seeks to rebut the charges against him; because Paul has been imprisoned on account of his gospel (see 1:13), he identifies his testimony in court as testimony on behalf of the gospel. If in fact he is using these words in their legal sense, it may well be that his trial has run its course and that he now awaits the verdict. But he is concentrating here not on his own fate but on the faith of his readers, for whom his prayer is that they prove themselves to be faithful adherents to the Christian faith.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul does turn to his own fate as he begins the body of the letter (1:12–4:20). The first point he wants to make (1:12–18) is that his imprisonment, contrary to what one might expect, namely, that it has hindered his proclamation of the gospel, has had just the opposite effect. It has in fact worked to advance the gospel, since it has become clear to those who are responsible for keeping him in prison that the reason for his imprisonment has to do with his being a Christian, not a thief or a murderer or some other sort of social miscreant. That knowledge has apparently lessened the danger he is in, since it has resulted in the Christians where he is imprisoned being even more bold about proclaiming the gospel. To be sure, there are some who seek to take advantage of Paul’s inability to move about the area in order to advance a gospel that diverges from Paul’s, perhaps even hoping thus to make Paul’s imprisonment even more painful. Yet Paul is not upset. The net result, he observes, is that for whatever motive, whether to oppose or support Paul, Christ is being preached, and since that is the major thing, Paul rejoices in it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul assures his readers that he can rejoice in more than that, however. He can also rejoice in his confidence that his trial will have a positive outcome (1:19–26), not least because of the prayers offered on his behalf by the Christians in Philippi. Yet until the verdict is announced, no one knows that outcome. If it is negative, Paul is prepared for that as well, confident that his death will enable him to glorify Christ even as his life has allowed him to do thus far. In fact, Paul does not know whether to hope for acquittal or conviction. The former would mean he could continue his apostolic proclamation, the latter that he could be with Christ apart from the troubles of this life, since the outcome of the trial would apparently be either freedom or execution.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Time in prison was not a usual form of punishment in the Hellenistic world. Normally, a person was imprisoned simply so that the authorities could lay hold of him or her when the time came for the trial. Once the trial concluded, they would be either set free or put to death, though release would sometimes be accompanied by some form of physical punishment, such as beating with wooden poles. In the case of the wealthy and highborn, a third option might be exile to some barren landscape, but ordinarily imprisonment for a specified period of time as <a id="pg395" class="calibre3"></a>punishment was not normally used. Thus Paul can anticipate either freedom or death, and he is confident that since freedom means the opportunity for further apostolic proclamation, he will in fact be released.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Discussion of the outcome of his imprisonment and his possible return visit to Philippi leads Paul to think of his beloved Christians there and the kind of life they are to lead (1:27–2:18). At the heart of this section Paul has included what may be an early confession or hymn centering on the meaning of the career of Christ (2:6–11), a segment of early tradition Paul has adapted to his purposes in this letter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This confession or hymn is placed in the service of a very practical intention, however, and that is the unity of the Christian community in Philippi, a unity grounded in the willingness of its members to defer to one another (2:3–4). It is further evidence that all of Paul’s theology has ethical implications, as all his ethical admonitions are grounded in his theology.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While many scholars have argued that Paul has taken over and even adapted an earlier Christian confession or hymn in 2:6–11, it is not impossible that Paul himself may have written it. Scholars are not in agreement on either the shape of the original tradition or how it is to be divided into strophes as a hymn. There are some words in it that Paul does not use elsewhere, but that cannot be a sure indication that Paul did not write it. His vocabulary was undoubtedly larger than the words contained in his letters. Whether he wrote these verses or is citing them, their point fits well with his theological intention as expressed in his letters, and since he did in fact include it in this epistle, we may have confidence that he found it expressive of the theological point he wanted to make to the Philippians.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Fundamental to this “hymn” is the contrast between what Christ was prior to his incarnation and what he became as a result of it. There has been some confusion on how the unusual Greek word <em class="calibre5">harpagmon</em> in v. 6 is to be translated and understood. If it is construed as a participle, it refers to the act of snatching something away, that is, to robbery; if it is construed as a passive verbal noun, it refers to what is snatched away. Yet in either case, it seems odd that Christ would regard equality with God, which he already had according to 2:6a, as either robbery or something he needed to grasp. Neither alternative seems to fit the context. In fact, there is another way to construe the word. It is highly likely that Paul is using an idiom referring to exploitation of something for one’s own gain. Hence v. 6 would best be translated “who, although he was in the form of God, did not count that equality something to exploit for his own benefit.” Rather, as v. 7 says, Christ emptied himself of that God-likeness and took the form of a vulnerable human being.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A second humiliation followed: not only did Christ give up his God-likeness, he also gave up his human life on the cross in obedience to God (v. 8). Because of that self-denying obedience, God exalted Christ to a higher level than he had before the incarnation and crucifixion by giving Christ God’s own name, <a id="pg396" class="calibre3"></a>“Lord” (“Lord” is used in the Hebrew Bible in place of the personal name of God, <em class="calibre5">YHWH,</em> which was never pronounced). As a result Christ has now reassumed his God-likeness, and, having been given God’s own sacred name, is now to be publicly worshiped by the whole of creation (vv. 9–11).</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Philippians 2:5–11</p>
<p class="sbo">The notion that somehow Jesus, the man of Galilee, had also shared God’s own nature in some mysterious way arose very early in the Christian faith, as Phil 2:5–11 shows. One of the characteristics that Pliny noted when he investigated the beliefs and practices of the Christians in Asia Minor around the year 110 <small class="calibre9">CE</small> was that in addition to pledging to do no wrong, they also sang a “hymn to Christ as to a God” when they assembled (<em class="calibre5">Letters</em> 110). That was no problem for Pliny to understand, since the Romans, like the Greeks, knew of many gods. It was a problem for the monotheistic Jewish background out of which Christianity arose, however, and the problem of how there could be one God and yet have Jesus, and later the Holy Spirit, also share that divinity was not worked out until centuries later at the church councils of Nicea (325 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>) and Chalcedon (451 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>). Understanding the reality of a God who is triune and yet one remains at the heart of the Christian faith and distinguishes it from other religions, both monotheistic and polytheistic.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">What seems to underlie the emphasis on Christ’s obedience in both his incarnation and in his submission to the cross is the contrast with Adam, who, also reflecting God’s image, decided to try to achieve divinity in direct disobedience to God’s command. On the other hand, Christ, who was already divine, nevertheless in obedience to God sacrificed all for the good of sinful humanity. This reflects elements seen elsewhere in Paul’s christological statements (see, e.g., Rom 5:18–19; 2 Cor 8:9).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Having introduced this hymn to Christ with the advice to be willing to put the interests of others ahead of one’s own (2:3–4), Paul concludes the hymn by urging obedience to God’s will (vv. 12–13). Paul concludes this part of the letter body with further admonitions to peace and unity within the Christian community, conceding that this means that the readers must act in a way quite different from that of their non-Christian contemporaries (2:14–18).</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg397" class="calibre3"></a>In the next section of the letter body Paul returns to his current situation and his plans to send Timothy (2:19–24) and Epaphroditus (2:25–30) to Philippi. The brief allusion to untrustworthy fellow Christians (2:29) indicates another of the troubles Paul faced in his apostolic ministry. It indicates that when he affirms his personal weakness (as in his letters to Corinth), he means that literally and not just figuratively. He did in fact carry on his mission in what looked more like weakness and defeat than like power and triumph, and, as the troubles at Corinth showed, some fellow Christians derided him for it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The discussion of Epaphroditus’s faithfulness to the task the Philippian Christians had given him (2:25–30) may reflect an impression on the part of some at Philippi that Epaphroditus was lazy or was loafing since he did not return to Philippi sooner. Paul assures them that Epaphroditus’s illness was real, nearly fatal (v. 27), and that he had indeed been faithful to their charge that he help Paul, faithful almost to the point of death (v. 30).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Following a general admonition (3:1), Paul turns to an attack on some people who have evidently been urging the Philippians that they must be circumcised and hence become true Jews if they want to be true Christians (3:2–3). After assuring his readers that those who follow Christ are the true circumcision, Paul turns to an account of his own conversion to demonstrate that his denying the validity of circumcision, and hence Jewishness, is not the result of his lack of either (3:4–16). Arguing that he was as Jewish as one could be (vv. 4–6), he relates how at his conversion he renounced it all in order to follow Christ (vv. 7–8). Paul renounced the advantages of membership in the chosen people, along with trust in any sort of righteousness that would come by observing the law or belonging to that people, because a right relationship with God can in fact come only by trusting in God because of what he has done in Christ Jesus (v. 9). Because of what God has done, the “righteousness through the law” now stands in opposition to the “righteousness from God, which depends on faith.” This is why Paul follows the way of weakness and self-sacrifice, the way that Christ followed to his death on the cross, so that by sharing in Christ’s death, Paul may at some future point share in Christ’s resurrection as well (3:10–11), something that at present he has not obtained (vv. 12–13a). Paul sums up his point: forgetting the glories of his Jewish past, he now devotes his total energies to the future, to the time when he will share in Christ’s glory (vv. 13b-14), a point he is confident is shared by the mature Christians at Philippi (vv. 15–16).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul concludes this discussion (3:17–4:1) with a harsh characterization of the Judaizers, those whom he opposes: their reliance on their Jewish heritage makes them enemies of Christ’s cross, since, if they are saved by their Jewish heritage, they do not need the cross (3:18). Their observance of dietary regulations means that they concentrate too much on their stomachs, and their demand for circumcision means that they concentrate too much on their male members (“their <a id="pg398" class="calibre3"></a>shame”). All that means they still function as those concentrating on earthly things (food, physical bodies) rather than heavenly matters (3:19). But in fact Christians must not be so absorbed with matters of this earth and its culture since Christians are like aliens in this world, living apart from their true homeland, where they are citizens. Christians are in fact not at home in the culture and values of this world. Rather, Paul affirms, Christians are citizens of heaven. That is their true homeland, and it is from there that Christ will come to transform reality and redeem sinners (3:20–21). Paul concludes by returning to his opening point: he urges his beloved fellow Christians in Philippi to stand firm (4:1) in the faith they share with him (3:17).</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Were the “Judaizers” in Philippi?</p>
<p class="sbo">It is difficult to determine whether the opponents Paul has in mind in 3:2 are currently present in Philippi, or whether the warning is general in nature, in case people should show up in Philippi with the same kind of message that, for example, the “Preachers” had delivered to the Galatian Christians. The discussion here is short and rather general, with only the third description (“those who mutilate the flesh”) openly referring to people who would have shared the views of the Galatian “Preachers.” Furthermore, such warnings do not seem to play a role in the remainder of Philippians. As a result, it looks as though this is more a warning of potential danger from outside sources than an attempt to counter the message of people currently active among the Philippian Christians. Paul seems here to want to inoculate his readers against infection with any distorted views of the Christian faith.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">After urging two women who were his helpers in the task of evangelism to give up their dispute with one another and then urging his other fellow workers to help in that reconciliation (4:2–3), Paul provides some general admonitions on the Christian life (4:4–7). Rounding out his discussion by repeating some of the points he made earlier in the letter (4:8; cf. 2:1), Paul then turns to the final topic of the letter body, namely his gratitude to his readers for the gift to him brought by Epaphroditus (4:10–20).</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is evident from this discussion that the Christians in Philippi had underwritten Paul’s mission by gifts at other times as well. Paul mentions three other such gifts, one when he left Macedonia and two when he was still in Thessalonica (which, like Philippi, is in Macedonia). So the gift brought by Epaphroditus was the fourth gift of theirs to Paul. Such gifts made it possible for Paul to refuse <a id="pg399" class="calibre3"></a>support from Christian communities, for example Corinth, when in his judgment the community might interpret such support as giving them the right to restrict what he preached. The variations among Paul’s various mission churches was evidently such that he would accept support from some but not from others. It may also have been the case that Paul would accept support from a congregation only after he had left the city it was located in, lest again those who supported him might think they could exercise some influence over his ministry among them. However that may be, it is clear that the Christians in Philippi had proved themselves partners with Paul in his apostolic mission, and he was grateful for it, not only for the money but also for the evidence that the gospel had taken root and produced a mature and committed Christian community (4:17). Paul concludes the letter body with a doxology (4:20).</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter closing (4:21–22) contains Paul’s usual greetings, both to his readers and from those around him. While he does not identify his own writing in this instance, it is quite possible that the characteristic benediction with which he closes the letter (v. 23) was written in his own hand.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is a sign of the extent to which Paul identified himself and his life with the gospel of Jesus Christ that a letter like this one to the Christians in Philippi, essentially a thank you note for a gift intended to underwrite his ministry, would call forth a letter so rich in theological and ethical content. His self-description in 3:7–9, describing his reversal of values on the occasion of his conversion, was patently accurate — he now gave himself totally to the Christ who had turned his life completely around.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch16ah02"><a href="part0002.html#rch16ah02" class="calibre6">16.2. SOME QUESTIONS</a></p>
<p class="pf">The major literary questions about the letter concern when and where it was written and the integrity of the letter as we have it, that is, whether it was originally a unity or consists of parts of two or even three letters combined into the form we now possess.</p>
<p class="ah">16.2.1. Place and Time of Composition</p>
<p class="pf">In attempting to determine when the letter was written, it is interesting to note that it does not refer to the collection for Jerusalem, as do Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. This means that Philippians was written either before Paul had agreed to make the collection (thus making it a very early letter) or after he had delivered the collection to Jerusalem (thus making it a very late letter). Or it could mean that the Philippian Christians had already given (2 Cor 8:2–4) and <a id="pg400" class="calibre3"></a>hence no longer needed to be reminded, in which case the collection’s absence from the letter is of no help in determining when during Paul’s missionary career the letter was written.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Attempts have made to resolve the problem by determining where Paul was imprisoned when he wrote the letter (1:14, 17). If that could be determined, it might give us a hint as to when he wrote the letter. Although some have argued that the references to imprisonment are symbolic, meant to display Paul’s servitude to Christ, most scholars have found here references to genuine physical imprisonment.</p>
<p class="calibre8">To determine where Paul was imprisoned, certain evidence needs to be taken into account:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">1. He mentions that it is known throughout “the whole Praetorium” that he is imprisoned for Christ (1:13).</p>
<p class="blf">2. He mentions Christians “of Caesar’s house” (4:22).</p>
<p class="blf">3. He says that a number of people are at work preaching the gospel, albeit from mixed motives (1:15–17).</p>
<p class="blf">4. He promises to come to Philippi soon (1:26; 2:24).</p>
<p class="blf">5. He sharply attacks what appear to be Judaizers, indicating that they still pose a threat to the gospel to the Gentiles (3:2–3; see also 1:15–17).</p>
<p class="blf">6. The letter presumes a number of round-trips between Philippi and Paul’s location in prison. Four journeys were completed before the letter was written:</p>
<p class="sbul">a. Someone brought the Philippians news of Paul’s imprisonment.</p>
<p class="sbul">b. They sent Epaphroditus to Paul with a gift.</p>
<p class="sbul">c. Someone brought the Philippians news that Epaphroditus had become ill.</p>
<p class="sbul">d. Someone told Paul that the Philippians had learned of Epaphroditus’s illness and were worried about him.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In addition, Paul mentions four future journeys:</p>
<p class="sbul">e. Epaphroditus will return to Philippi, probably with the letter.</p>
<p class="sbul">f. Timothy will bring news to Philippi as soon as Paul knows the outcome of his trial.</p>
<p class="sbul">g. Timothy will return to Paul with news of the Christians in Philippi.</p>
<p class="sbul">h. Paul will travel to Philippi as soon as he is able.</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">The three visits relating to Timothy presume the completion of one before another may begin. On the other hand, Timothy will leave when Paul’s trial is over, regardless of when Epaphroditus leaves. All this travel assumes a relatively short distance between the site of Paul’s imprisonment and Philippi.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Acts mentions two imprisonments that could qualify, one in Caesarea during Paul’s trip to Rome and the other in Rome itself. The imprisonment in Rome would <a id="pg401" class="calibre3"></a>account for the presence of the Praetorium and those of “Caesar’s house,” and in so large a city one could presume many missionaries at work. It appears from Paul’s letter to Rome, however, that the threat of the Judaizers had not been felt at its full force there. Further, the travel plans outlined make it difficult to posit Rome as Paul’s location, since the distance between Philippi and Rome would require a journey of six or <a id="pg402" class="calibre3"></a>eight weeks. To complete the four journeys outlined in the letter as already completed would require about six months, perhaps longer. Again, the repeated mention of “soon” (2:19, 24) would be unlikely for a journey that at the earliest could be complete only some five or six months hence, allowing time for Timothy to make the round-trip and then for Paul to journey to Philippi. And with Caesarea also the distance is such as to make the journey unlikely, and there is no evidence for members of either the Praetorian guard or Caesar’s household in that city.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Paul the Prisoner</p>
<p class="sbaft">Some thirty percent of the book of Acts is devoted to scenes in which Paul is under arrest — whether imprisoned or on trial. In cataloging his afflictions, he adds to this picture, noting that his imprisonments far outnumbered those of the false apostles who opposed him (2 Cor 6:4–5; 11:23–29). In several letters attributed to Paul, he describes himself as “in chains” or “in prison” (e.g., Phil 1:7, 13, 14, 17; Col 4:18; Phlm 1, 10, 13; 2 Tim 1:16; 2:9).</p>
<p class="sb">In the Roman world, imprisonment was not a legally accepted <em class="calibre5">punishment</em> for a crime, but was generally employed as a means to ensure the appearance of the accused at trial. Nevertheless, incarceration might serve as a means of compelling stubborn persons to obey a local magistrate. Confinement was also employed as a form of protection, and, following trial, prisons kept those awaiting sentencing or execution.</p>
<p class="sb">Imprisonment might take many forms. Confinement in a state prison was the most severe of these. Less severe was military custody, which might take the form of confinement to a military barracks or camp or even within one’s own house or apartment. A person could be ordered into the care of a magistrate, a leading citizen, or even one’s own family.</p>
<p class="sbl">The severity of the confinement, including the added possibility of related scourging and chains, was directly related to one’s public status. The higher one’s social status, the less severe the measures of confinement. At the same time, imprisonment itself was a form of dishonor, with arrest and incarceration used to silence undesirable persons and those who had been imprisoned suffering the stigma linked to arrest and incarceration. Both Acts and Paul’s letters demonstrate the variety of ways in which Paul’s chains were challenges and occasions for embodying and broadcasting the gospel. Included among these responses are two found in Philippians and Philemon, where the shame of his bonds becomes for Paul both an opportunity for theological reflection on identifying with the suffering of Christ and a rhetorical device for calling others to embrace humility.</p>

<p class="calibre8">A more likely imprisonment would be in Ephesus, which, although not mentioned in Acts, is hinted at in Paul’s Corinthian correspondence (2 Cor 18–9a; cf. 1 Cor 15:32 for another imprisonment there). Ephesus was near enough to Philippi that the journey by sea could be completed in a matter of weeks, and Paul was imprisoned at Ephesus at the height of the conflict with the Judaizers. We know from inscriptions that there was a Praetorian guard stationed there and members of Caesar’s household living there (Latin <em class="calibre5">qui de caesaris domo</em>). The travels mentioned in Phil 2:19–24 are in accord with the travel plans outlined in 1 Cor 4:17 and 16:10 (see also Acts 19:22). The journey spoken of in 1 Cor 16:3–4 and Phil 1:26; 2:24 is planned in Acts 19:21 and carried out in Acts 20:1. Origen, a third-century church father, knew a tradition that Philippians was written between the writing of 1 and 2 Corinthians while Paul was in Ephesus.</p>

<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg403" class="calibre3"></a>If the foregoing discussion is on target, it would mean Paul wrote to the Philippians during his time in Ephesus, namely sometime in the mid-50s. Such a conclusion, however, must remain tentative, given the tenuousness of the evidence on which it is based.</p>
<p class="ah">16.2.2. The Integrity of the Letter</p>
<p class="pf">The abrupt change in tone between 3:1 and 2 and the shifting content of the various chapters have prompted a number of scholars to posit that two or perhaps even three different letters were combined to make up what we know as Philippians.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Those who find two letters combined tend to include in one letter 1:1–3:1a and 4:21–23 and assume it was sent after Epaphroditus had recovered from his illness and was about to return home with that letter. The remaining verses, 3:1b–4:20, are then taken to be a note Paul wrote to thank the Philippians when he received the gift of money that Epaphroditus had brought.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Those who find three letters tend to combine 1:1–3:1a with 4:4–7 and 4:21–23 as a general letter urging the Philippian Christians to lead a worthy life and to rejoice in the Lord. A polemical and corrective letter in found in 3:1b–4:3, 8–9, while 4:10–20 comprises the thank you note for the gift Paul received from the Christians in Philippi.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Such speculative reconstructions of the correspondence between Paul and the Christian community in Philippi assume that all ancient letters follow a logical outline and a uniform tone throughout, an assumption that would be incorrect even for modern letters. There is no textual evidence that this letter ever existed in any form but the one we have in the NT, and on that basis it would probably be well to continue to look on it as one letter, existing pretty much as Paul composed it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">How then are we to account for the differences in tone and subject matter? One contributing factor has to do with the technology of ancient letter writing. All ancient writing was done in capital letters with no indication of paragraphs or even sentences. Indeed, there were not even any spaces between words. Documents were written with as many letters across the page as its width would allow, with no regard to where words ended. If the piece of papyrus, for example, was wide enough for sixteen letters, the document would consist of as many sixteen-letter lines as were necessary to convey the material.</p>
<p class="calibre8">So one would have to provide clues about how readers were to understand a letter in some other way than by forming sentences and paragraphs. Clues about the thought structure of a letter would be built into the language of the letter itself. For example, a section of a letter might end with the sentence with which it began <a id="pg404" class="calibre3"></a>to show that that part of the discussion had been concluded (e.g., Matt 4:23; 9:35). Or one might repeat a statement to show that the discussion was now going on to another topic (e.g., Rom 5:18–19; 2 Cor 5:18–19).</p>

<p class="sbh">Reading</p>
<p class="sbaft">If we still wrote the way people of Paul’s day did, Phil 1:12–13 would look like this:</p>
<div class="senseline">

<p class="sl1l">TISFORCHRIST</p>
</div>
<p class="sbo">Add to that the fact that letters were more difficult to make out when written on papyrus than our printed letters are, and it is little wonder that people had a hard time making sense of a piece of writing when they first looked at it. Anyone who could read something straight off at first sight was the object of praise (e.g., Petronius, <em class="calibre5">Satyricon</em> 75, which speaks of a young man as “excellent: he can do division and read books at sight”).</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">These changes of subject would be emphasized by the voice of the one reading to a group (cf. Col 4:16). Even someone reading to himself or herself would read out loud. When Philip “heard” the Ethiopian reading from Isaiah (Acts 8:30), the Ethiopian was simply following normal practice. And even a person writing vocalized the material as he or she wrote. Even in dictation, the secretary who did the actual writing would vocalize while writing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is quite probable that those places in Philippians where Paul changes the subject abruptly, sometimes taking on a very different tone, do not indicate the conflation of different letters. It is much more likely that they were intended as verbal clues to the readers and listeners that Paul was now moving on to another <a id="pg405" class="calibre3"></a>subject. Thus the short exclamations in 3:2 alert the listeners to a change in subject matter, namely a discussion of what is and is not essential for the Christian faith. Similarly, the repetition in 4:8–9 of the form of the material contained in 2:1 alerts the listeners to the fact that Paul will again change the subject, this time to thanking them for their gift. It is on the basis of ancient letter technology that we can thus argue for the unity of the letter from Paul to the Christians in Philippi.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">On the Use of a Scribe</p>
<p class="sbo">If one was using a scribe to write a letter, it was necessary to dictate at a pace that made it possible for the scribe to form the letters on the papyrus. Because the scribe used a split reed pen on the rough surface of the papyrus, it took longer to write than it takes us to write something with a modern pen or pencil on a piece of paper. Thus one had to speak slowly. Seneca, for example, complains of one Vincius that he spoke as slowly as if he were dictating (<em class="calibre5">Epistula Moralis</em> 40.10). Such a technique of dictation means that any grammatical confusion in Paul’s sentences was not the result of his words pouring out so rapidly that he did not take time to formulate grammatical sentences. Such confusion more likely resulted from the fact that, being forced to dictate slowly, Paul would have forgotten how he began a sentence by the time he concluded it. But in fact there are very few places in Paul where his grammar is jumbled; he apparently knew how to dictate his letters even at the slow pace that dictation required.</p>
