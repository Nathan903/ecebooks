<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch21" class="calibre6">James</a></p>
<p class="pf">While often cherished for its “practical wisdom,” the NT book known as James has never been able to shake off the judgment of Protestant Reformer Martin Luther that, in comparison to books such as Romans and Galatians, the Gospel of John, and 1 Peter, James was “really an epistle of straw.” Those documents were to be prized as the “true kernel and marrow of all the books,” because they would “show you Christ” and “teach you all that is necessary and salvatory for you to know.” By comparison, James had “nothing of the nature of the gospel about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">That Luther’s harsh evaluation of James as a book bereft of the gospel and of Christ still lingers on in modern interpretations can easily be documented. Interpreters persist in labeling James a Jewish book with but a thin Christian veneer, the most indistinctly Christian document in the NT. Even the assessment of James as a book of practical wisdom reflects Luther’s judgment of its shortcomings, inasmuch as it implies that James lacks any genuine theological insight or foundation, though it can be pressed into service as a book with “practical” guidelines for everyday life. This view clearly privileges theological argument over practical counsel, “hearing the word” over “doing the word.” Ironically, this is precisely the separation that James itself decries. But the tenacity of his witness has never completely silenced his critics.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Questions of one sort or another about James can be traced back farther than the Reformation. The Muratorian Canon, a list of books accepted as canonical that is typically dated to Rome in the middle of the second century (see pp. <a href="part0029.html#pg600" class="calibre3">600</a>–<a href="part0029.html#pg601" class="calibre3">601</a> below), does not list James as part of the canon. Writing in the early fourth century, the church historian Eusebius still refers to James as one of the “disputed” books, although he himself deems it apostolic and orthodox and states that it is recognized or accepted by many. The late fourth-century Latin church father and <a id="pg492" class="calibre3"></a>translator of the Vulgate, Jerome, asserted that James had been accepted into the church “little by little.”</p>

<p class="calibre8">Who was James? And what sort of letter did he produce such that it could be judged, on the one hand, to merit a place in the canon and, on the other, to be an epistle full of straw?</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch21ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah01" class="calibre6">21.1. “JAMES, A SERVANT OF GOD”</a></p>
<p class="pf">In the prescript of the letter, the author identifies himself simply as “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.” But just this self-designation raises the question of James’s identity, for, according to tradition, this is the James called by Paul “the brother of the Lord” (Gal 1:19), who appears elsewhere in the NT as the leader of the early church in Jerusalem. Yet the author of this epistle never acknowledges his fraternal relationship to Jesus, his apostolic commission or role, or his authority with respect to the churches to whom he writes. Since referring to any of these relationships or roles would likely have strengthened the authority of his epistle, the absence of any such reference does raise questions about his identity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And yet his reticence may actually give us a clue to his identity. The terseness of his self-identification as “James” suggests that he could simply call himself “James” and expect immediate recognition of his identity. Few candidates known to us seem to be viable contenders for this honor other than James, the brother of Jesus. Of course, our roster of possible candidates is limited to the pages of the NT. That there were other important figures named “James” that we do not know cannot be ruled out. But James’s acceptance into the canon “little by little” likely assumes the early church’s identification of James as “the brother of the Lord.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh"><a id="pg493" class="calibre6"></a>The Brothers of Jesus</p>
<p class="sbaft">The NT mentions Jesus’ brothers in various places:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">On the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” (Mark 6:2–3, NRSV)</p>
<p class="sbbqf">Then his mother and his brothers came; and standing outside, they sent to him and called him. A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, asking for you.” And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” And looking at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!” (Mark 3:31–34, NRSV)</p>
<p class="bqs">So his brothers said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing; for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.” (For not even his brothers believed in him.) (John 7:3–5, NRSV)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">There are scholars who argue that although the letter is attributed to this James, it was actually written by another, later, figure in the church, a disciple or admirer of James who sought to make his teaching or witness available to later generations. Others have suggested that an otherwise unknown editor has taken material from James and reworked it into its present form — a suggestion already put forward by Jerome. Such arguments typically rest on the alleged difficulty of attributing James’s literary polish, grammatical style, rhetorical flourishes, and affinities with Greco-Roman moralists to a Galilean from a family of artisans whose native tongue was Aramaic. As we shall see, very similar arguments are raised against Petrine authorship of 1 Peter. However, Peter’s reference to an amanuensis, Sylvanus (1 Pet 1:1; 5:12), has often been taken to alleviate some of the problems in attributing that letter to Peter. James does not explicitly mention use of an amanuensis or refer to any coauthors, as Paul does. Yet this silence does not rule <a id="pg494" class="calibre3"></a>out the possibility that the author had such help, or even that someone unknown to us gathered and shaped material originally from James into its present form, aiming to make James’s voice available to subsequent generations. Too little is known of James to allow us to dismiss out of hand the possibility that he stands behind this epistle in some significant fashion.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Jerome on James</p>
<p class="sbaft">The church father Jerome reports these traditions about James:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">James, who is called the brother of the Lord, surnamed the Just, the son of Joseph by another wife, as some think, but, as appears to me, the son of Mary sister of the mother of our Lord of whom John makes mention in his book, after our Lord’s passion at once ordained bishop by the apostles of Jerusalem, wrote a single epistle, which is reckoned among the seven Catholic Epistles and even this is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority. (<em class="calibre5">De Viris Illustribus</em> 2)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">What we do know of James comes primarily from references in the Pauline letters and Acts. In 1 Cor 15:5–7, Paul singles James out as the witness of a resurrection appearance of the risen Jesus. James figures most prominently in Galatians, where in recounting the story of his conversation Paul speaks of going up to Jerusalem, meeting with James and Peter (Gal 1:18–19), and receiving the right hand of fellowship from them and from John, as they sent him to the Gentiles (Gal 2:9). Later, Paul relates that “certain men came from James” to Antioch (Gal 2:12). Paul does not spell out their exact relationship to James or the exact reason for their visit. But their appearance caused Peter to withdraw from eating together with Gentiles. Peter clearly respected James’s authority, and his withdrawal from table fellowship with Gentiles indicates that he assumed that James held a more conservative stance with respect to the ritual requirements of the law. According to Acts, James was a leader of the early Jerusalem church (Acts 12:17; 15:13) who at the Jerusalem conference (Acts 15) laid out the basic requirements to which Gentiles ought to be held and who later appealed to Paul to demonstrate to the Jews in Jerusalem his faithful observance of the law (21:18–25). In these reports from Paul and in Acts, scholars have found evidence of James’s conservative Jewish Christian stance toward the law.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg495" class="calibre3"></a>In this regard it is striking that Josephus, the first-century Jewish historian and apologist, recounts that Ananus, a Sadducean high priest, had James the brother of Jesus, and others, accused as breakers of the law and stoned to death, leading the citizens of Jerusalem to complain to King Agrippa (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 20.200). Remarkably, Josephus’s report speaks of James as a <em class="calibre5">lawbreaker —</em> exactly the charge that, according to Acts, James urged Paul to show to be false! Josephus’s account does not square particularly well with the time-honored assumptions of NT scholars that James was a “conservative Jewish Christian” with respect to the law who had sharp conflicts with Paul, the champion of the radical law-free gospel for Gentile Christians. How does the data of the letter of James bear on this reconstruction?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Josephus on James</p>
<p class="sbaft">In his <em class="calibre5">Jewish Antiquities</em> (20.199–201), Josephus, the first-century Jewish historian, writes of the death of James:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">The younger Ananus, who, as we have said, had been appointed to the high priesthood, was rash in his temper and unusually daring. He followed the school of the Sadducees, who are indeed more heartless than any of the other Jews, as I have already explained, when they sit in judgment. Possessed of such a character, Ananus thought that he had a favorable opportunity because Festus was dead and Albinus was still on the way. And so he convened the judges of the Sanhedrin and brought before them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ, and certain others. He accused them of having transgressed the law and delivered them up to be stoned. Those of the inhabitants of the city who were considered the most fair-minded and who were strict in observance of the law were offended at this.</p>

<p class="ah" id="ch21ah02"><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah02" class="calibre6">21.2. JAMES AND JEWISH CHRISTIANITY</a></p>
<p class="pf">“Jewish Christianity” is an equivocal term, capable of application to more than one part of the early Christian movement. In its broadest sense, “Jewish Christianity” refers to any of the forms of Christian faith held by Jews who came to <a id="pg496" class="calibre3"></a>acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah. In this sense of the term, all the earliest adherents of the Jesus movement were “Jewish Christians.” The disciples of Jesus, including Peter and John, Jesus’ brothers, including James and Jude, and Paul, the “apostle to the Gentiles,” were all Jewish Christians. But Paul’s churches consisted mainly of Gentiles who had come to Christian faith and so could be distinguished from Jewish Christian congregations not only because they were shaped by the Pauline gospel, but also because by heritage and birth their adherents came from among the Gentiles of the Mediterranean world. Finally, with reference to the early centuries of the church, “Jewish Christianity” refers to Christian movements of the second and third century, such as the Ebionites, whose continued adherence to various facets of the law, including circumcision and purity regulations, put them outside the mainstream orthodox and increasingly Gentile church.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The estimation and role of the law figure prominently in defining “Jewish Christianity.” But from certain perspectives, James might have been viewed with suspicion for failing to champion the distinctive practices — circumcision, food laws, and Sabbath observance. He thus could have been accused of sacrificing just those observances given to Israel by God that marked and assured its continued distinctive identity. To be sure, James does evidence a high and positive view of the law when he speaks of “the perfect law, the law of liberty” (1:25) and warns against transgressing and ignoring the law (2:9–11; 4:11). Yet while James speaks of “keeping the law,” he never insists on observance of precisely those aspects of the law that created conflict in the early church, including circumcision, purity and dietary regulations, and Sabbath-keeping.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Instead, in the epistle of James we find the epitome of the law in the command to love one’s neighbor, as in Jesus’ interpretation and proclamation of the law. James’s designation of the “royal law” <em class="calibre5">(nomos basilikos)</em> echoes Jesus’ proclamation of the kingdom <em class="calibre5">(basileia)</em> with the double love command at its center. Like Jesus and the prophets before him, James thus radicalized the application of the law by crystallizing its thrust in terms of love and honor of one’s neighbor. Clearly this way of formulating the heart of the law moved inexorably toward a redefinition of the very term “Israel.” For if Israel were no longer to be distinguished by those traditional markers of circumcision, Sabbath-keeping, and food laws, which were the notable signs of its faithful observance of the law, how would it be defined? James’s answer to this implicit question is that “Israel” is to be defined by its faithfulness to the law interpreted in terms of the command to love one’s neighbor, in obedience to the Lord, Jesus, in whom are gathered “the twelve tribes in the Dispersion.”</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch21ah03"><a id="pg497" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah03" class="calibre6">21.3. “TO THE TWELVE TRIBES IN THE DISPERSION”</a></p>
<p class="pf">The recipients of the letter are designated as “the twelve tribes in the Dispersion.” At first glance, this seems to refer to Jews living outside the Promised Land. The phrase “the twelve tribes” continued to be used as a metaphor for Israel as the people of God, long after twelve distinctly identifiable tribes were more of a memory and ideal than a visible reality (<em class="calibre5">2 Bar</em> 77:2; 78:4; <em class="calibre5">Pss. Sol.</em> 17:26–28; Josephus, <em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 1.221; Matt 19:28 par. Luke 22:29–30; Rev 7:5–8; 21:12). However, the hopes lingered that the dispersed people would be gathered from out of the Dispersion. In some Jewish writings such restoration is thought of as part of the work of a future king from the line of David, while in other documents such hopes focused on God’s activity without any particular human intermediary.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The use of this typical designation for Israel in a letter written by someone who acknowledges Jesus as Messiah and Lord raises the question of the identity of the epistle’s addressees. In particular, two interrelated questions arise: (1) Does the designation of the readers as “the twelve tribes” indicate that they were Jewish Christians, or should it be taken figuratively as referring to all Christians as the “true” Israel or people of God? (2) Should the reference to them being “scattered among the nations” be taken literally as a geographical “exile,” or metaphorically, signifying that their true home is their heavenly home and their dwelling on earth a kind of “exile” or sojourn in an alien land? Although these are the options typically suggested, they are not mutually exclusive. If the readers are understood to be Jewish Christians, as is typically the case, that does not settle the question whether they were “dispersed” or distant from their native land, from their true heavenly home, or from both. On the other hand, neither does the use of “Jewish” terminology settle the question of the identity of the readers, since the NT elsewhere gives ample evidence of the redefinition of the people of the Messiah, both Jew and Gentile, as bearing the marks and responsibilities of the “Israel of God.” Striking parallels exist between James’s designation of his readers and 1 Peter’s (“to the exiles of the Dispersion,” 1:1), and that epistle goes on to apply language used of Israel in the OT (“a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people,” 2:9–10; cf. Exod 19:6; Hos 1:8–10) to a Christian community that clearly included Gentiles.</p>
<p class="calibre8">So although the letter’s address alone does not settle the question of its readers’ identity, when taken with other evidence, it strongly suggests that its readers included Jewish Christians, even if perhaps they were not all Jewish. To be sure, they are <em class="calibre5">messianists,</em> as the identification of Jesus as “Lord and Christ” has already made clear, and so they are an “Israel” whose hopes have been fulfilled in the coming of the Messiah. The use of “the twelve tribes” as a self-designation by an avowedly messianic sect would clearly indicate that the group believed that the restoration of Israel had begun.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The other evidence for the identification of James’s readers as Jewish <a id="pg498" class="calibre3"></a>Christians consists of the indirect testimony of the letter itself. Its affinities with Jewish wisdom literature, respect for the law, resolutely theocentric ethic, and use of phrases such as “synagogue” for the congregation (2:2) are at least compatible with the theory of a Jewish Christian readership. Moreover, the sorts of issues with which James deals differ markedly from the substance of many a Pauline letter. Paul dealt mainly with Gentiles, or with congregations with a significant proportion of Gentiles, who not only had to be taught the Christian faith but also socialized into the convictions and morality that had long been part of the fabric of Israel’s corporate life. Hence, Paul deals in his letters with issues of sexual morality, idolatry, relationship to pagans and to social customs of the Hellenistic world, the relationship of the law to the Spirit and Christian behavior, and even the nature of the resurrection. James, on the other hand, reflects few of these concerns. His voice sounds much more like the prophets of the OT, who warned Israel against lip-service to Yahweh, cheating the poor, defrauding widows and orphans, and trusting in one’s own success and riches. The “Jewishness” of James turns out on closer inspection not to distinguish the document from that which is distinctly Christian, but to align it with the prophets of the OT and the teaching of Jesus. Given the portrayal of James in the NT, the contents of the letter, and the address to the readers, it seems best to conclude that James was writing to a group of Jewish Christian readers.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Beyond that general identification, it is difficult to determine more specifically the social location or situation within the congregation’s life that provided the occasion for this epistle. While most ancient Greek manuscripts designate this document “the epistle of James,” some add the adjective “catholic,” meaning “general” or “universal,” to qualify “epistle.” This small addition arose from the letter’s lack of specific reference to persons, places, incidents, or relationships that might serve to identify its readers. And if the letter in some way represents both the teaching of James and the work of a later collector or editor, it would be quite difficult to give a precise picture of the readers of the final edition of this material.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Still, the letter does seem to be written with specific readers with a particular set of problems or concerns in mind. On the one hand, the injunctions of the letter have in view some who are rich and powerful, warning them against their continued self-indulgence, favoritism, and neglect of the poor. On the other hand, some of the readers are poor, oppressed by those with power and privilege, and in need of encouragement and exhortation to persevere in the face of adversity. Both groups are admonished to preserve peace and love in their communal life, although the warnings against the rich have an entirely different tenor than the exhortations to the poor. James can be both prophet, warning of the coming doom of those who fail in their obligations to their humbler brothers and sisters, as well as pastor, encouraging those who are struggling and suffering. One detects James’s pastoral stance in his frequent references to his readers as “brothers and sisters” and “my beloved.” He exhorts his readers as fellow sojourners out of his sense of <a id="pg499" class="calibre3"></a>communal responsibility and commitment. As “the twelve tribes of the Dispersion,” Christian sojourners on a pilgrimage home, they are encouraged and exhorted to persevere on that journey together.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch21ah04"><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah04" class="calibre6">21.4. THE GENRE OF JAMES</a></p>
<p class="pf">As already mentioned, ancient manuscripts of James entitle it an “epistle.” The opening verses of James, with their terse greeting typical of Hellenistic letters, seem to confirm that description. Yet beyond that prescript, James has few features testifying to its epistolary character. It lacks any sort of formal closing and signature (but cf. 1 John), any personal greetings, the names of any members of the congregation(s) addressed, or references to specific present situations or past events. It betrays no evidence of the nature or duration of the relationship between James and his readers. In other words, James is hardly a personal letter of the sort known to us from other specimens in the NT or the Hellenistic world. In other respects, James differs from the apostolic epistles of Paul, with their assertions of apostolic authority and intricate theological arguments for his understanding of the gospel and its implications. James does not elevate his status or authority, a lacuna that some Greek manuscripts sought helpfully to rectify by introducing the term “apostle” or even “the holy apostle” following “James.” Outside the letter’s opening, James never asserts his apostolic authority, refers to his past or present labors, or cites personal circumstances to motivate his readers. Perhaps this is to say no more than James is not Paul!</p>
<p class="calibre8">In terms of its form, James’s most striking affinities are not with the Pauline letters but with moral instruction and wisdom literature of both the Jewish and Greco-Roman world. Greco-Roman moral treatises intended to instruct one toward the goals of virtue, conceived of in terms of a well-ordered life marked by virtues such as control of one’s emotions, speech, and conduct. The virtuous life could even be framed in “theological” terms by relating the life of the virtuous person to God. For example, the philosopher Plato urges “moderate conduct” since it is “dear to God” and bears out the maxim that “like is dear to like” (<em class="calibre5">Laws,</em> 716D-E). Numerous other points of overlap between James and the Greco-Roman moralists can be adduced. Testing proves the virtue of the “wise” <em class="calibre5">(sophos)</em> person (Jas 1:2), who can be called a “friend of God,” a term associated in the OT with Moses and in Jewish thought with Abraham (Exod 33:11; 2 Chron 20:7; Jas 2:23). The life of the virtuous person is marked by self-control, especially of one’s speech (1:19; 3:1–12) and passion and desire (4:1). Congruity between the principles to which one holds and one’s concrete conduct is expected. Images such as reining in one’s tongue or passions as one controls a horse, guiding a ship with a small rudder, and the mirror as a metaphor for moral self-reflection (1:23–24) are features <a id="pg500" class="calibre3"></a>of James seen in Hellenistic treatises as well. These themes and metaphors are of particular interest because they serve in both James and Hellenistic moral treatises to sketch the portrait of a truly “wise” person as the self-disciplined person.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But there are significant differences as well, which lead us to consideration of the wisdom literature such as one finds in the books of Proverbs in the OT and Sirach and Wisdom in the Apocrypha. James shares a number of similar themes with this wisdom literature, including the importance of single-minded devotion to God, the role of testing and discipline and their relationship to wisdom, the power as well as the pernicious effects of speech, the connection between anger and communal strife, the lure and ultimate emptiness of wealth, and the sharp contrast between righteousness and wickedness, which are closely associated with wisdom and foolishness. And while self-discipline plays an important role here, more important still is the communal dimension of life. Self-discipline is not an end in itself, but serves to foster the love and peace that ought to characterize the congregations of those who profess obedience to the one true God. As can be seen from the examples in the table on page 501, it cannot be doubted that James was familiar with the wisdom writings of the OT.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But James also manifests points of contact with ancient Jewish and Christian tradition known as “the two ways.” One ancient Christian document of the early second century begins, “There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there is a great difference between the two ways” (<em class="calibre5">Didache</em> 1:1). There the “way of life” is defined as following the commandments to love God and neighbor, and the way of death is the way of wickedness, cursing, murder, adultery, lust, fornication, theft, idolatry, witchcraft, robbery, false witness, and “a double heart.” While there are differences between the vices denounced in the <em class="calibre5">Didache</em> and in James, both share the tendency of the “two ways” tradition to depict these two ways of living as starkly opposed to each other, with no middle ground. One path leads to God, one path leads away from God, and a person inevitably walks one path or the other. The effort to straddle the line is criticized by both James and the <em class="calibre5">Didache</em> as “double” thinking, which cannot be done any more than one can walk in two directions at once. This “two ways” traditions grows out of the biblical wisdom tradition, which paints the opposition between “wisdom” and “foolishness” in sharply contrasting colors and correlates them with “righteousness” and “wickedness.” The hortatory tone of James, with its numerous admonitions, its warnings to the disobedient, and its description of consequences and promise of rewards, allows it to fit easily into the “two ways” tradition.</p>
<p class="calibre8">James’s wide-ranging contacts with numerous moral traditions of early Jewish and Christian literature and its apparent familiarity with the themes and concerns of the Greco-Roman moralists tell us as much about the world from which the document emerged as they do about the specific sources that may have influenced James. James’s similarities with the literature of the Hellenistic moralists point to the extent <a id="pg502" class="calibre3"></a>to which Hellenism and Judaism had already interacted prior to the first century, even in Palestine, as well as to the fact that the themes dealt with by James and others are the common stuff of everyday life. Themes such as communal interaction, power, money, speech, testing, and suffering weave their way through James as they do through the prophets, the wisdom literature, and the Hellenistic moralists. James draws together those instructions particularly relevant to those “in the Dispersion.”</p>

<p class="calibre8">But the one source and influence that we have thus far left out of consideration may well be the most significant for James: the traditions of Jesus’ teaching. In particular, James demonstrates striking points of contact with the traditions common to Matthew and Luke from the hypothetical source called Q. James exhibits the same emphasis on eschatology and the coming judgment, the wisdom themes of trust in God, integrity in lifestyle, and circumspect behavior, and the prophetic critique of all injustice, oppression, and abusive use of wealth and status. These are all also features of Jesus’ teaching.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch21ah05"><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah05" class="calibre6">21.5. JAMES AND JESUS</a></p>
<p class="pf">As we noted above in our discussion of Jesus’ teaching (ch. 8), Jesus emphasized that the moral requirements of the law — justice, mercy, and faith — were the heart of God’s will for Israel and were to be the norms governing its life as a people of God. Jesus spoke of the entire law as summarized in two commands: love of God and love of neighbor. The greatest commandment in the law called for wholehearted devotion to God: “You shall love the <small class="calibre9">LORD</small> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deut 6:5), which Jesus not only quoted (Matt 22:36) but also paraphrased in assertions such as, “No one can serve two masters. . . . You cannot serve God and mammon” (Matt 6:24). James sounds the notes of this call to a single-minded, unswerving commitment to God in his warnings against “double-mindedness” (1:7; 4:8) and that “friendship with the world is enmity with God” (4:4). The second commandment, love of neighbor, shapes James’s numerous moral commandments, including the exhortations to guard one’s tongue, control anger, lessen strife, foster peace, and be impartial; to take care of widows, orphans, and the poor and oppressed; to pray for those in need; and to strive to make one’s religious profession live through particular expressions of love in word and deed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Just as we tabulated some of the comparisons between James and wisdom literature, so too we can graphically set out some of the parallels between James and the teachings of Jesus as found in the Synoptic Gospels. Some of the contacts suggest direct dependence on or use of traditions of Jesus’ teaching, while others show that James reflects the same spirit as that found in the Synoptic traditions (see the table on pp. 504–5).</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg503" class="calibre3"></a>James follows Jesus in locating the heart of the law in the twin commands to love God and neighbor (cf. Gal 5:14). James also emphasizes — as did Jesus — the singular importance of congruity between profession of one’s faith in God and expression of love for one’s neighbor, with an emphasis on the expression of that love in the merciful, charitable, and humble stance one takes with respect to others. In fact it can easily be argued that the links between the ethic of James and the teaching of Jesus are as strong as, if not stronger than, those between any other document of the NT and the traditions of Jesus. But precisely because James echoes various traditions so clearly and because the letter lacks any specific description of the occasion for which it was written, it is difficult to pinpoint the specific situations that James wished to address.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In general it is clear that the epistle of James represents the application of Jesus’ messianic interpretation of the law and of life before God. More specifically, these injunctions, clustered as they are around actions toward one’s neighbor and particularly around relationships between rich and poor, suggest that James was indeed dealing with a congregation, or perhaps several congregations, marked by factionalism and partiality, with the rich neglecting the poor and so failing to love God and neighbor. These difficult trials may have tempted the poor to lose hope. But both groups may have been subject to anger, misuse of the tongue, envy, doubt and wavering, and an ultimate failure to trust in God. The imperatives of the book of James show how “friendship with God” is to be lived out in a number of specific cases and how both rich and poor can be tempted to abandon their “friendship with God” in favor of “friendship with the world.”</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch21ah06"><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah06" class="calibre6">21.6. DOERS OF THE WORD</a></p>
<p class="pf">The injunction to be “doers of the word, and not merely hearers” (1:22) is programmatic for the content and outline of James. This is scarcely remarkable given James’s impressive contacts with the OT prophets, Proverbs and wisdom literature, and the teaching of Jesus, all of which insist on the integral connection between conduct and commitment, behavior and believing, doing and hearing. But James does not urge simply a general “doing,” as though he were simply encouraging his readers to do something or to do more than they were currently doing. He is not interested in “works” for their own sake, but rather urges his readers to act on their professed belief in God (“hearing the word”) by living a life that exhibits trust in God in a consistently gracious, giving, hospitable, and merciful way of life (“doing the word”), particularly in relationship to the poor and humble, such as widows and orphans (1:27). Without such care for the lowly, without love, one’s faith is dead.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus while both rich and poor are addressed throughout the letter, and many <a id="pg504" class="calibre3"></a>of its injunctions could be applied quite generally, it is clearly the rich who come in for the harshest criticisms. So, for example, when James urges and warns his readers not to show partiality, the conduct one is to avoid is demonstrated by the contrast between how a rich person and a poor person are welcomed in the <a id="pg505" class="calibre3"></a>synagogue. For anyone to honor the rich at the expense of the poor is to dishonor the God who has “chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom” (2:5). What James condemns is the partiality demonstrated toward the rich. But in subsequent passages he makes it clear that the rich, who revel <a id="pg506" class="calibre3"></a>in their possessions, honor, and status in this life, will soon find their position and those of the poor reversed (5:1–6). Their future destiny of misery, a life without any wealth, wearing nothing but rags for clothes, surely mirrors the plight of those whom they neglect in the present life.</p>

<p class="calibre8">What it means to be a “doer of the word” is to live as God commands and to act as God acts. The character and activity of God are central to the theological vision of James, and form the basis for the shape of the faithful life of discipleship enjoined within it. Divine sovereignty, a basic tenet of Jewish and Christian convictions about God, serves as the explicit and implicit warrant for many of James’s arguments and commands. There is one God (2:19; 4:12), who, as the source of all goodness, is untainted by evil (1:13, 17, 20) and gives generously to all who ask (1:5, 7, 17; 3:15, 17; 4:6). God is a righteous and impartial judge (2:12–13; 4:12; 5:7–9), whose will is effected in the world (4:15; 5:11). God responds to the prayers of the oppressed (5:4), rewards the humble and faithful (1:12; 2:5), but judges the proud and fickle. Indeed, God has chosen the poor (2:5; 4:5) and opposes those who oppress them, inasmuch as the poor, like all human beings, are made in the likeness of God (3:9).</p>
<p class="calibre8">The theme of the “likeness of God” marks James’s injunctions in two ways. First, those who desire to live in friendship with God must respond to God in appropriate ways. God’s sovereignty calls for the response of humility, trust, obedience, and prayer. In light of God’s future judgment, James urges people to perseverance, faithfulness, and purity of heart. God generously gives wisdom, and not only are people enjoined to ask God for it, but are then to live out of the rich supply of that gift. By humble reception of the gift of wisdom from God, they manifest their responsiveness to the Giver. But a second way in which the theme of the “likeness of God” comes out in James is in the call to imitate God. God is merciful, generous, and impartial, taking the side of the poor and oppressed. Just as God has chosen to exalt the poor, so those who desire to be “friends of God” are to eschew favoritism toward the rich and powerful and serve the poor. Commitment to a generous and merciful God who espouses the cause of the poor and humble thus prescribes a way of life marked by the same qualities and behavior: faith must be put into practice.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A conspicuous feature of James’s vision of the life of faithful discipleship is the emphasis on speech as indicative of inner character and integrity. Of the nearly sixty imperatives in James, just over half deal with conversation and speaking, and the basic guideline is laid out early on: “Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger” (1:19). People should “bridle their tongues” (1:26; cf. 3:2–3), otherwise their “religion is worthless.” These are strong words. Control of one’s tongue was a virtue prized by various Greco-Roman moralists as well as by the wisdom teachers of Israel. While James esteems the one who can control his or her tongue, he admits that consistent mastery of one’s words is nearly an impossibility. <a id="pg507" class="calibre3"></a>“No one can tame the tongue — a restless evil, full of deadly poison” (3:8). Yet he does not limit his horizons simply to control of speech. For it is human speech, above all else, that gives insight into the human condition: “With [the tongue] we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God” (3:9). The failure to put faith into practice, against which James speaks so vehemently, reveals itself nowhere more clearly than in the human propensity to profess faith in God while dishonoring those made in the likeness of God. James does more than decry the inability to control one’s tongue. He also points forcefully toward the positive use of speech in its role in instructing (3:1–2), blessing others, and manifesting the traits of wisdom, gentleness, peacefulness, impartiality, humility, and integrity. His ethic of Christian discipleship aims not at heroic conduct but at disciplines of conduct for the long haul of everyday life.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The realism of James’s moral vision also displays itself in his injunctions to endurance, patience, and maturity. Life brings trials, and they are the means by which a mature faith is developed. Christians should therefore respond to the trials of life with joy. In this thinking James is not alone, for similar trains of thought can be found elsewhere in the Old and New Testaments and in the apocryphal wisdom books (1 Pet 1:6–7; Rom 5:3–4; Hebrews 12; as well as Prov 27:21; Sir 2:1–6; Wis 3:4–6). Job, the paradigmatic sufferer in the OT, is adduced as an example not only of patience, but of endurance in testing (5:11). That James opens his epistle with the theme of perseverance in testing suggests the particularly difficult situations of oppression and suffering that occasioned his writing. Some of his addressees were oppressed and suffering and, due to their position or status in life, had little or no power to change their circumstances or deal with their oppressors as equals. James encourages them to “persevere,” in part because in all likelihood they have few other options. James thus reflects traditional injunctions of Jewish and Christian literature to persevere, but the pointed references to the rich who oppress the poor (2:1; 5:4–6) give a glimpse of at least some of the situations in which these injunctions found an audience in need of reassurance and encouragement.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Indeed, James’s harshest invective is directed towards the rich who oppress the poor. He minces no words in warning them of their coming doom:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">The rich will disappear like a flower in the field. For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. It is the same way with the rich: in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away. (1:10–11)</p>
<p class="bqs">Listen! The wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. (5:4–5)</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon"><a id="pg508" class="calibre3"></a>These descriptions of the rich echo the prophetic characterizations and denunciations of the abuse of the poor by the rich, such as one finds in Isa 3:11–15; 5:8–10; 9:18–10:4; Amos 2:6–7; 5:11–12; 6:4–6; 8:5–6; Micah 2:1–5, and in other parts of the OT that make provisions for the needs of the poor (Exod 22:21–7; Lev 25:35–55; Deut 10:16–19; 15:7–11). Observations about the temporary nature of riches echo proverbs of the wisdom tradition that warn against trusting in one’s wealth (Job 15:30; Prov 2:8; Sir 14:11–19). And of course it is difficult to miss the parallels to the traditions of Jesus’ teaching, in which warnings against riches, self-sufficiency, partiality, and oppression of the poor are often coupled together (Matt 6:19–21; Luke 12:13–21). While James’s warnings to the rich have ample precedent, therefore, in the OT and teachings of Jesus, the extent to which the theme is highlighted in James suggests that the relationships of the rich and poor and the power and peril of wealth were not just traditional themes but also reflections of concrete problems with which James had to deal. And since the rich are addressed directly, they seem to be part of the assembly of Christians to whom the letter is written. But while the poor are referred to as “brothers and sisters,” the rich are never called by that designation, indicative of James’s warnings that they are not living out the faith they profess. He warns his readers against the lure of riches, the temptation to be partial to the rich, and the neglect of the poor among them, for such behavior is not fitting for those who desire friendship with the very God who has “chosen the poor.” James’s criticism of the norms of a culture that values wealth and possessions as the marks of achievement, status, and worth provides another example of the way in which he warns that “friendship with the world is enmity with God.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">James sets his instructions and warnings in an eschatological framework, speaking of rewards and punishment due at the coming judgment. Not only does he warn the rich against the coming judgment at the “last days” (5:1–6), but he also encourages the faithful to persevere through temptation so that they may receive “the crown of life” (1:2–4, 12). He speaks of the poor as “heirs of the kingdom” (2:5), reflecting Jewish eschatological language of “inheriting” the kingdom or the land. Judgment also figures prominently in the important section on mercy, faith, and works (2:12–13) and is one of the prerogatives that belong to God and ought not be usurped by human beings (4:11–12). Finally, the “coming of the Lord” (5:7) provides the warrant for patience and perseverance (5:7–11), as well as for repentance and mourning (5:1). Ultimately, James’s warnings of judgment and promise of reward derive from his vision of the demand and character of God, who works justice and gives mercy to the humble and lowly. Those who hear the word of this God are also to do it.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch21ah07"><a id="pg509" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch21ah07" class="calibre6">21.7. HEARING AND DOING, FAITH AND WORKS</a></p>
<p class="pf">We come, then, to a discussion of the passage to which the entirety of James’s epistle is sometimes unfortunately reduced, the discussion of faith and works in 2:14–26. James begins his discussion with the query, “What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works?” This rhetorical question makes perfect sense in light of his earlier directive that people are to be “doers of the word, and not merely hearers,” another formulation in which James joins together love of God and neighbor. Jesus’ warnings that only the one who “does the will of my Father in heaven” will enter the kingdom strikes the same note. James’s exposition of the relationship of faith and works is one way in which he casts his argument about hearing and doing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But his treatment of faith and works (2:14–26) uses language and imagery that seems directly related to, and in some way dependent upon, Paul’s discussion of the same issues:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">Gal 2:16: “Yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p class="blf">Rom 4:2: “For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.”</p>
<p class="blf">Jas 2:21: “Was not our ancestor Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?”</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">Along with the juxtaposition of “faith” and “works,” particularly striking is James’s use of the key text Gen 15:6 — the only OT text to link “faith” and “righteousness” — to bolster his point that Abraham’s “faith was active along with his works, and faith was brought to completion by his works” (2:22). Gen 15:6 is also crucial to Paul’s argument in Galatians (3:2–7) and Romans (4:3–22, especially vv. 3–8) that Abraham and his true descendants are justified by faith, not works of the law.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The apparently vexing problem of the differences between James and Paul can be alleviated to some extent by noting that they are talking about different problems and using the same vocabulary (faith, works) to make rather different points. Paul’s concern is with the relationship between “works of <em class="calibre5">the law</em>” and “faith in Christ,” whereas James’s reference to “works” lacks the crucial interpretative phrase “of the law.” For Paul the pressing theological point has to do with how the coming of the Messiah, Jesus, affects the role and function of the Mosaic law, particularly for Gentile believers. In that regard, “Christ” and “law” stand in tension with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But for James the issue is quite different. James is arguing for the inseparability of religious convictions (“faith”) and concrete behavior (“works”) <em class="calibre5">within</em> the <a id="pg510" class="calibre3"></a>context of the messianic community. James is not arguing for “justification by works” against the Pauline gospel of “justification by faith.” Rather, he is concerned with the relationship of “faith,” construed as one’s basic commitments and beliefs, and “works,” conceived of as tangible deeds of love and mercy. Thus he writes:</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Erasmus’s Paraphrase</p>
<p class="sbaft">The great Renaissance scholar, and one of Martin Luther’s adversaries in debate, Erasmus of Rotterdam, produced a number of paraphrases of the NT. The following excerpt comes from his paraphrase of the book of James:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">But what is faith without love? Love moreover is a living thing; it does not go on holiday; it is not idle; it expresses itself in kind acts wherever it is present. If these acts are lacking, my brothers, I ask you, will the empty word “faith” save a person? Faith which does not work through love is unproductive; no, it is faith in name only. An example here will make clear what I mean. If someone says blandly to a brother or a sister who lacks clothing or daily food, “Depart in peace, keep warm, and remember to eat well,” and after saying this, gives him or her none of the things the body needs, will his fine talk be of any use to the ones in need? They will be no less cold and hungry for all his fine talk, which is of no help to their need. He gives them only verbal support, but does nothing in actual fact. A profession of faith will certainly be equally useless if it consists only of words and does nothing except remain inactive as though dead. It should no more be called faith than a human corpse merits the name of human being. Love is to faith what the soul is to the body. Take away love and the word faith is like something dead and inert. It will do you no more good before God to confess in words an idle faith than fine speech benefits a neighbor in need when he must be helped with action. People think they are being mocked when you say to them, “Keep warm and well fed,” and give them neither food nor clothing. Just so the person who offers no tangible proofs of his faith but repeats every day, “I believe in God, I believe in God,” seems to be mocking God. A person who gives lip-service to love possesses a fruitless charity. In the same way a person whose belief is only a matter of words possesses a faith that serves no purpose.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs"><a id="pg511" class="calibre3"></a>Those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act — they will be blessed in their doing. (1:25)</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">The law enjoins doing, acting; but it is the perfect law of liberty, the “royal law,” which is fulfilled in loving one’s neighbor:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (2:8)</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">Here there are striking points of contact with Paul, who in Galatians writes:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (5:13–14)</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">For both Paul and James, Christian freedom gives the opportunity not to do whatever one wants, but to love one’s brothers and sisters. Thus when James writes, “be doers of the word and not merely hearers who deceive themselves” (1:22), he makes the same point that Paul makes in Rom 2:13, “For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but the doers of the law who will be justified.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">But James is fighting on a different front. He is concerned to correct those who argue that only “faith,” taken as orthodox belief, really matters. To prove the point, he cites the basic tenet of Judaism, that God is one, taken from the familiar <em class="calibre5">Shema:</em> “Hear, O Israel: The <small class="calibre9">LORD</small> is our God, the <small class="calibre9">LORD</small> alone. You shall love the <small class="calibre9">LORD</small> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deut 6:4–5). James comments that it is good to believe these words: “You believe that God is one; you do well” (2:19). But to emphasize the folly of leaving it there, he adds: “Even the demons believe — and shudder.” The demons recognize the existence of the one God. The question that naturally follows is what one does in response to such belief. According to James, the demons merely shudder. Those who truly believe in the one God will respond neither by “shuddering,” nor by merely “hearing,” but by “doing” what that one God commands in “the royal law according to the Scriptures, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”</p>

<p class="pf">At the outset of this chapter, we noted Luther’s harsh condemnation of James: “it does not show you Christ” and has “nothing of the gospel about it,” he wrote. Luther was referring in part to James’s lack of explicit Christian themes such as the <a id="pg512" class="calibre3"></a>significance of the death and resurrection of Christ and the gift and work of the Holy Spirit. But in its canonization and subsequent use of James, the Christian community has found an important guide for its corporate life together. Unflinching in its insistence that faith and works, hearing and doing, commitment and conduct, belong together, James offers the reader no easy path of discipleship and gives the lie to every profession of Christian faith that does not see love of neighbor as an indispensable expression of love of God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">James is not a book <em class="calibre5">about</em> Christ and the cross. But it is a book that sounds much like Jesus and often speaks in tones uncannily reminiscent of Jesus’ own teaching. It urges its readers to the same single-minded devotion to God and uncompromising commitment to the neighbor. It promotes justice, mercy, integrity, humility, faithfulness, and perseverance; it attacks injustice, pride, dishonesty, and self-sufficiency; it promises the good gifts and wisdom of God to all who ask in humility and faith. In all these respects, it echoes the very voice of Jesus and his call to the kingdom of God and thus does indeed “show Christ.”</p>
