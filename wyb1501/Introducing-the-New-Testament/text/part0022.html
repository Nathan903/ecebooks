<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch18" class="calibre6">Paul’s Letters to the Thessalonian Christians</a></p>
<p class="pf">It is evident from 1 and 2 Thessalonians, as it is from Philippians, that the Macedonian Christians were particularly dear to the apostle’s heart. He clearly had great success in evangelizing that area, his converts there remained faithful to his teachings, and as a result he was encouraged by them and longed to spend time with them. Considering the treatment he received in Corinth and the questions raised about his gospel in Galatia, it is small wonder that Paul found comfort in the churches in Macedonia.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The city of Thessalonica was located in the Roman province of Macedonia (northern Greece) about 100 miles to the west of Philippi. It was founded about 316 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> by Cassander, a general of Alexander the Great and a son-in-law of Philip II of Macedonia. Named to honor Philip’s daughter Thessalonikeia, who was Cassander’s wife, it became the capital city of Macedonia when that area became a Roman province in 146 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>. It served as the port at the head of the Thermaic Gulf of the Aegean Sea and a main station on the Via Egnatia, an important Roman road connecting the Balkans to Asia Minor. As both administrative center and center for travel and transport, Thessalonica had become an important and prosperous city by the time Paul preached there. Its importance for the churches established by Paul is attested by the many NT references to the Christians there (Acts 17:1–13; 20:4; 27:2; Phil 4:16; 2 Tim 4:10 in addition to 1 and 2 Thessalonians). Despite a generally hostile reception in Macedonia at both Philippi (1 Thess 2:2; Acts 16:22–24) and Thessalonica (1 Thess 3:15–16; Acts 17:5–7), Christian communities took firm root there and continued to support Paul in his missionary enterprise.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch18ah01"><a id="pg428" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch18ah01" class="calibre6">18.1. 1 THESSALONIANS</a></p>
<p class="pf">There has been little question that this letter was in fact written by the apostle Paul. Its intended readers were Christians drawn for the most part from among the Gentiles in Thessalonica (1:9; 2:14–16; 4:5). It is apparent that Paul (and apparently Timothy) remained in Thessalonica for a considerable period of time during their initial visit. Paul twice received aid from Philippi during this time (Phil 2:15–16) and settled down to practice his trade so as not to be a burden to his newly-formed church (1 Thess 2:9). Paul’s missionary method was apparently to stay for longer periods in places he evangelized, probably announcing Christ to people who came to his rented shop in the forum of a given city rather than standing in a corner of the marketplace for a public oration. He was criticized for being an ineffective public speaker (2 Cor 10:10), and anyway, given the sensitivity of the Roman authorities to any new collegia that were formed, an attempt to form a new Christian community in so public a manner would call unwanted attention to it. Again, even if such preaching were undertaken in the marketplace, its effectiveness would be relatively limited; after a time people would tend to ignore someone who had the same message week after week. It is therefore more likely that Paul carried on his mission on the basis of contacts made in his shop. In that way his gospel gradually spread as he encouraged customers whom he converted to tell their friends about Christ as well.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Some sort of opposition had apparently broken out against the Christians in Thessalonica (2:14b) about which Paul had forewarned them while he was there (3:4). Although Paul has harsh words to say about the Jews who opposed his proclamation of Christ (2:15–16; see Acts 17:5–7), the wording of 2:14 makes it clear that just as Christian Jews in Judea had suffered persecution from their fellow Jews who were not Christians, so the Thessalonian Christians were suffering at the hands of their non-Christian compatriots. Paul, unable to return in person to speak with them (2:17–18), had sent Timothy to encourage them to remain faithful to Christ in the face of their persecution. Timothy’s return with good news about how the Thessalonian Christians were remaining faithful to Christ in the face of opposition prompted Paul to write this letter.</p>
<p class="ah">18.1.1. The Letter</p>
<p class="pf">The letter opening is shorter than that of most Pauline letters, containing almost no qualifications of sender or receiver, nor does Paul identify himself as an “apostle.” Perhaps he felt that he was well enough accepted by the readers that he did not need to state it. Two others are identified as senders, Silvanus (or Silas) and Timothy, who may well have accompanied Paul when he founded the church in <a id="pg429" class="calibre3"></a>Thessalonica. The salutation is also shorter than the usual form, with the usual “from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” absent.</p>

<p class="en" id="sben01"><a href="part0022.html#rsben01" class="ennum">*</a>The border between the thanksgiving and the letter body is not definite.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">It is difficult to isolate with any precision the opening prayer of this letter. In content, the opening prayer seems to consist of 1:2–3. Yet the sentence containing those verses continues to the end of v. 5, even though Paul begins to address his readers directly in 1:4. Again, prayer language is found as far away as 2:13, indicating a prayerful attitude that extends far beyond the opening two verses. It is probable, therefore, that we should consider 1:2–3 to be the formal prayer, with 1:3–4 then forming the transition to the body opening, which in its first few sentences continues to be cast in the form of a prayer of thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is also the case that, typically for Paul, the prayer expresses at least some of the substance he intends to discuss. In this instance, he mentions the Thessalonians’ faith, love, and hope (1:3), which he will then discuss at more length in the letter body: faith (1:2–10), love (2:17–3:10), and hope (1:9–12; 3:13; 4:13–5:11, 23). These concepts are important for Paul in other letters as well. Love, for example, figures very prominently in 1 Corinthians 13, and faith becomes thematic in Romans and Galatians. Here the main emphasis appears to be on hope, appropriate in light of the persecution and suffering the readers are presently undergoing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter body is divided into two halves. The first half (1:6–3:13) concerns Paul’s original visit to them and their reaction to the gospel then and at the present time. The second half (4:1–5:22) consists of advice from Paul to the Christians in Thessalonica, concerning both their conduct and their beliefs. The letter concludes with a benediction and a request for prayer on Paul’s behalf (5:23–25) and a letter closing (5:26–28).</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg430" class="calibre3"></a>In the first segment of the first half of the letter body Paul rehearses the events occurring when he first went to Thessalonica (1:6–2:16). This segment is itself divided into three parts: 1:6–10; 2:1–12; and 2:13–16. The first part of the discussion concerns the fame of his readers’ faith, which has spread well beyond Macedonia and even the other Greek province of Achaia, which helps Paul in evangelizing those areas (1:6–10).</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the second part (2:1–12), Paul recalls to his readers his own conduct during his time among them. He reminds them that he had come to them after suffering shameful treatment in Philippi, and he was apparently opposed in his apostolic proclamation in Thessalonica as well (2:1–2; cf. Acts 17:5–9). This did not hinder him from proclaiming his apostolic message, since that message has divine, not human, origin (2:3–6a). Despite the authority conferred on Paul by that God-given message, he did not exploit his authority among the Thessalonians, but treated them as gently as a nurse treats the children under her care (2:6b-8).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Pursuing such gentleness, he earned his own keep by toiling at his trade so that he would not be a burden to those whom he was evangelizing (2:9). Changing the metaphor, Paul says he acted like a father to his children, guiding them into the kind of life appropriate for them to lead in light of the God who had called them to be subjects of his kingdom (2:10–12).</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the third part (2:13–16) Paul reminds them of their reception of his apostolic proclamation, not merely as Paul’s words but as what it really was, namely God’s own word at work among them (2:13). As a result, they recapitulated in their life as a Christian community the kind of experiences undergone by the original Christian communities in Judea, namely, suffering at the hands of their compatriots for their acceptance of the apostolic message (2:14). Obviously Paul has a very negative view of those Jews who oppose the mission to the Gentiles as they had opposed the establishment of Christian communities in Judea, and indeed as they had opposed Jesus himself and the prophets before him (2:15–16). Paul here reflects a negative assessment of Israel’s history in light of its continued opposition to God’s word as spoken through the prophets. This negative tradition concerning Israel’s history is as old as Ezekiel, and it was then taken up in some strands of Christian tradition. Stephen’s speech at the time of his stoning (Acts 7:1–53) reflects this tradition, and his concluding words sound very much like the phrases of Paul (1 Thess 2:15): “Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered” (Acts 7:52, RSV). Paul apparently knew this tradition, and here connects the opposition to the Gentile mission to that same tradition.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the next segment of the first half of the letter body (2:17–3:13), Paul turns to an account of events that led up to and flow from the visit of Timothy to them. Paul wanted very much to visit them again but was unable to because “Satan <a id="pg431" class="calibre3"></a>hindered us” (2:18). How Satan accomplished that, or what events Paul attributed to the initiative of Satan, he does not say. He could send Timothy (3:2) when apparently he could not return himself, which may point to some sort of opposition in Thessalonica to Paul’s presence there. The recollection in Acts that Paul had been driven out by some general civic unrest (Acts 17:8–9) may reflect the reality to which Paul alludes here. However we may want to resolve that problem, it is clear enough that as a last resort Paul sent Timothy to visit them and encourage them in the midst of their “afflictions” (3:2–3) — probably social persecution coming from both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Archaeological evidence has indicated that a number of religious cults were active in Thessalonica at this time, cults devoted to such deities as Isis, Osiris, Serapis, and Cabirus, along with Jewish synagogues. Because those who became Christian had to abandon their former religious practices, adherents of any of those cults would be incensed when former participants now refused further participation. Given the drive to conformity in the Greco-Roman world, any such nonconformity to general practices would be met with hostility. It is probably from such sources that the opposition to the Christians made itself felt in Thessalonica. Paul had warned them earlier that such persecution would be their lot, and it had in fact now occurred (3:4). He wanted to know if they were holding firm in face of such opposition (3:5), which he also attributes, indirectly at least, to Satan (3:5, there called the “tempter”).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s relief at Timothy’s positive report (3:6–10) is what prompted this letter, and Paul pours out his relief and gratitude that the Thessalonian Christians have remained firm and have not weakened or given in to the pressures opposing them. He concludes with a benediction (3:11–13) that, as in some other letters (see Rom 11:36; Phil 4:7), separates the didactic from the hortatory portions of the letter body.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The second half of the letter body (4:1–5:22), as we noted above, contains advice from Paul concerning both the conduct and the beliefs of the Thessalonian Christians. He begins with advice on maintaining sexual conduct acceptable to the God who called them from the darkness of their former lives into the light of his kingdom (4:1–8). Sexual promiscuity was as much a characteristic of the Greco-Roman world as it is of the modern world, and Paul warns that such conduct goes against what God wills for his people. To give in to the promiscuity of the age, Paul says, is to disregard not human but divine instruction, and for that reason such promiscuous activity will not go unpunished. God claims the whole of a person, body as well as soul, and a person’s conduct must reflect those claims even in that person’s sexual activity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As far as mutual love is concerned (4:9–12), Paul is confident that he does not need to issue any particular advice, since he knows, evidently from Timothy’s report, that in this aspect of their Christian lives they are above reproach. His advice <a id="pg432" class="calibre3"></a>to “live quietly, mind your own affairs, and work with your hands” (4:11) is probably framed in light of the danger represented by hostile forces arrayed against the Christians, often in the form of severe social pressure to conform to the idolatrous customs of their non-Christian neighbors. Minding their own affairs does not mean that they are not to proclaim Christ to their fellow citizens, but it does mean they are not to become busybodies, constantly carping at non-Christians about <a id="pg433" class="calibre3"></a>their unacceptable behavior and pointing to themselves as models of correct living. That they are to work for their own living points to a problem in some areas of the Christian church, where the conviction that the end of the age was imminent led some people to the conclusion that they no longer had to provide for their future, since Christ would arrive at any time in the immediate future. Paul is convinced Christ will in fact return soon, but because the exact time cannot be <a id="pg434" class="calibre3"></a>known, Christians must continue to provide for themselves lest they become a burden on others.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">“Who Killed . . . the Prophets” (1 Thessalonians 2:15)</p>
<p class="sbaft">The negative statements in 1 Thess 2:15–16 regarding the Jews of Judea have led some scholars to question whether Paul could have written these verses. A number of other first-century Jewish sources show that prophetic critique of Jews who did not listen to their own prophets was a regular occurrence.</p>
<p class="sb">In <em class="calibre5">Jubilees</em> 1:12, these words are attributed to God:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">And I shall send to them witnesses so that I might witness to them, but they will not hear. And they will even kill the witnesses. And they will persecute those who search out the Law, and they will neglect everything and begin to do evil in my sight. <em class="calibre5">(OTP)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="sb">Josephus records numerous incidents in which unjust kings silenced the prophets (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 9.166–69, 9.263–66). <em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 10.38–39 relates the misdeeds of Manasseh and the people who followed his evil example:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">For, setting out with a contempt for God, [Manasseh] killed all the righteous men among the Hebrews, nor did he spare even the prophets, some of whom he slaughtered daily, so that Jerusalem ran with blood. Thereupon God, being wrathful at these things, sent prophets to the king and the people, and through these threatened them with the same calamities which had befallen their Israelite brothers when they outraged Him. They were not, however, persuaded by these words, from which they might so have profited as not to experience any misfortune, but had to learn from deeds the truth of what the prophets said.</p>
</div>
<p class="sb">In the <em class="calibre5">Lives of the Prophets,</em> the deaths of many of Israel’s most famous prophets at the hands of their own people are recorded (all from <em class="calibre5">OTP</em>):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">Isaiah, from Jerusalem, died under Manasseh by being sawn in two, and was buried underneath the Oak of Rogel, near the place where the path crosses the aqueduct whose water Hezekiah shut off by blocking its source (1:1).</p>
<p class="sbbqf">Jeremiah was from Anathoth, and he died in Taphnai of Egypt, having been stoned by his people (2:1).</p>
<p class="sbbqf">Ezekiel. This man was from the land of Arira, of the priests, and he died in the land of the Chaldeans during the captivity, after having prophesied many things to those in Judea. The ruler of the people Israel killed him there as he was being reproved by him concerning the worship of idols (3:1–2).</p>
<p class="sbbqf">Micah the Morathite was of the tribe of Ephraim. Having done many things to Ahab, he was killed by Joram his son at a cliff, because he rebuked him for the impieties of his fathers (6:1–2).</p>
<p class="sbbqf">Amos was from Tekoa. And when Amaziah had tortured him sorely, at last his son also killed him with a club by striking him on the temple. And while he was still breathing he went to his own district, and after some days he died and was buried there (7:1–3).</p>
<p class="bqs">Zechariah was from Jerusalem, son of Jehoiada the priest, and Joash the king of Judah killed him near the altar, and the house of David poured out his blood in front of the <em class="calibre5">Ailam;</em> and the priests took him and buried him with his father (23:1).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">In the next segment (4:13–18) Paul deals with what seems to have been a problem for the Christians in Thessalonica, namely the fate of those who did not remain alive until the return of Christ. Whether they were unsettled because of a faulty understanding of the resurrection, or by some sort of tradition that held only those who were alive when the Messiah came would benefit from his appearance, we do not know. The death and resurrection of Christ are keys to Paul’s exposition here, as it is in his theology generally. The Christian will recapitulate Jesus’ fate — his persecution, his death, and in the future, when Jesus returns, his resurrection. What is interesting here is that Paul tells the Thessalonians that he is relying on a teaching of Jesus for his information about the order of events at Jesus’ return (4:15–17). As in some other cases, we have here a record of a saying of Jesus that is not preserved in the Gospels, indicating that such sayings circulated individually prior to the writing of our Gospels, and that not all such sayings were included in them (for another such saying, see Acts 20:35). We can only wonder about how many other sayings of Jesus Paul knew and had in mind as he carried out his apostolic proclamation and admonition, sayings of which we have no <a id="pg435" class="calibre3"></a>other record. It is clear that even if Paul did not have access to the Gospels, which had not yet been written, he was not bereft of traditions about the words and deeds of Jesus.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Meeting in Homes and Businesses</p>
<p class="sbo">Many of the larger cities in the Mediterranean world would rent stalls in the marketplaces to itinerant workers. People with similar trades tended to rent stalls close to one another, so that people looking for that produce or service could readily find the location. It is likely that Paul carried on his profession — Acts 18:3 tells us it was tent-making — from such a rented stall. From such a location, he could speak to people who came in as he worked, as well as to his fellow craftsmen and craftswomen when no customers were about. It is apparent that he met Aquila and his wife Prisca in this way, since Aquila was a tentmaker as well (Acts 18:1). This meeting also provided Paul a place to stay, perhaps also a common feature of Paul’s missionary activity. Paul could then also hold worship services in the home of the person with whom he stayed. In the second century, an opponent of the Christian movement named Celsus complained that Christians carried out their activity not in some great public manner, but privately in homes and places of business, an interesting confirmation that this method of evangelizing had continued to be effective.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Paul assures his readers that the dead have not been abandoned by God, since at the time of Jesus’ return, they too will be raised to new life and will join those still alive in unending fellowship with Jesus in the new age. Being caught up in clouds and meeting Jesus “in the air” communicated far more to the original readers than we are likely to see there. Clouds were a regular accompaniment of the divine presence in both OT and Christian tradition (e.g., Exod 19:9; Mark 9:7). So their presence here guarantees God’s presence at this event. In the Greco-Roman worldview the “air” was the region between the earth and the moon that was inhabited by evil spirits, who fomented evil and harm on earth and sought to hinder the souls of the dead from ascending to the moon, where their evil deeds could be purged by the winds so the souls could return eventually to the eighth heaven. Thus, the point here is not that in some rapturous event, gravity will be overcome and Christians will fly among the clouds. Rather, Paul reports a tradition that speaks of God’s presence with the newly resurrected to protect them from the harmful spirits inhabiting the region of the air, so that nothing can then separate them from the divine presence. So complete is the transformation of reality when Jesus returns that even the abode of evil closest to the human sphere has been purged of its ability to harm those now joined with Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">One cannot discern the exact timetable of these events, however much one might covet such information. Paul tells his readers (5:1–11) that such information is unavailable, as they well know. Rather than trying to discern which events are the harbingers of such a transformation of reality, Christians are better employed in being ready for Jesus’ return at any time, since it will come without warning, like the thief who does not announce his break-in prior to its occurrence (5:2), an analogy that also finds a place in a saying of Jesus (Matt 24:43–44). Using the figures of night as a time for inattention, sleep, and drunkenness, and day as a time of activity, alertness, and sobriety, Paul urges his readers to be children of the day rather than of the night (5:5–8a). Changing the figure, Paul urges his readers to put on the armor appropriate for the battle Christians must fight against the forces of evil pressing in on them. He repeats here the three characteristics of Christian life mentioned at the outset of the letter (1:3): faith, love, and hope (5:8). With that armor, Christians will not despair when evil presses in on them. Rather, they will be confident in the salvation won for them by Jesus Christ, and will in that confidence encourage one another (5:9–11).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul concludes with some advice on how his readers are to conduct themselves within the community of faith (5:12–22). It is difficult to determine whether Paul’s first admonition (5:12) was prompted by a tendency toward resistance to advice from church leaders that led to some dissension within the Christian <a id="pg436" class="calibre3"></a>community in Thessalonica. The Greek word used of the work of those who labored among the Christians there <em class="calibre5">(kopia<span class="dcrit">ō</span>)</em> normally implied the work of proclamation; the Greek word used to designate the second group <em class="calibre5">(proist<span class="dcrit">ē</span>mi)</em> was usually used for the work of organizational leaders within the Christian communities. This implies therefore some kind of division of labor within the community and indicates that the rudiments of church organization were instituted already during the time of Paul’s missionary career.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Hostility toward Christians</p>
<p class="sbo">The very nature of the Christians’ commitment to Jesus as Lord, a fundamental early confession (see 1 Cor 12:3b), put them at odds with their surrounding culture politically, socially, and religiously. The normal commitment required in the Roman world was to Caesar as Lord, and using “Lord” in that sense with any other person would immediately make one suspect of treason. The Christian commitment to Jesus as Lord meant one could take part in no other religious observances, and this also was counter to the customs of that time. Religions that were not based on racial descent, such as the various mystery cults, did not place exclusive demands on their devotees. People were free to participate in as many cults as they wished. That Christians could not do so made their neighbors suspicious and opened Christians to accusations of hatred for other people and their customs. Add to that the strong pressure in the Greco-Roman world toward social and religious conformity, and it becomes clear why Christians could not look to non-Christians for any form of support. For that reason, the letters of Paul as well as the other letters in the NT stress the need for Christians to support one another and to stand united in the faith, lest the hostile forces arrayed against them break their resolve to continue to live the Christian life.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">The remaining admonitions are general in nature and all point to the need for mutual support among the Thessalonian Christians. Because of hostile pressure from those outside the Christian fellowship, a Christian community like the one addressed here was thrown back on its own resources to maintain its stability and morale.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus Paul admonishes the readers to do for one another what he himself is trying to do with this letter. His final admonition not to quench the Spirit but to test everything a prophet says is echoed in 1 John 4:1 and apparently was a commonplace of early Christian advice. The point is that while many may claim that <a id="pg437" class="calibre3"></a>what they say has been inspired in them by the Holy Spirit, that alone does not give validity to what is said. Rather, what is said needs to be tested against the norm of what God has already said in his acts with the people of Israel in the OT and more especially through God’s word given in Jesus Christ crucified and risen. Finally, the utterance of the apostles themselves provides the key test, and that is why Paul wrote his letters and why they were eventually collected and put into what became the canon of the NT. The need for such testing continues to the present, and the apostolic witness contained in Scripture functions now, as it did when Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, as the norm against which utterances or deeds that claim the inspiration of the Holy Spirit must be validated.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter body concludes with a benediction (5:23–24) and a request from Paul that his readers pray for him. The request for intercessory prayer occupies the place usually filled with greetings from people with Paul; apparently in this case Paul, for whatever reason, did not think such greetings appropriate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter closing contains two admonitions. The first urges that the readers greet one another with a holy kiss, the sign that all Christians were members of the body of Christ and hence all members of the family brought into being by Christ’s resurrection. The second charges the unnamed recipients of this letter, perhaps the church overseers mentioned earlier (5:12), to make sure that the letter is read in the presence of all the members of the community. The only time they would all be assembled would be for worship, and hence reading this letter would be done in that context. Since it was Jewish practice to read portions of the Torah and the prophets during services in the synagogue, such a context for reading the apostolic letters would be the first step toward regarding them as Scripture. Whether Christian literature was appropriate for reading in worship became at a later time one of the primary tests for determining if such a writing would command the authority that later led it to be included in the NT canon. Paul closes the letter with a salutation of grace that reflects the salutation with which he began the letter (1:1).</p>
<p class="calibre8">This letter gives us an interesting insight into the kinds of problems faced by the earliest Christian communities that sought to live out their Christian lives in the midst of a hostile society. However different from our modern situation the social and political conditions may have been that faced the original readers of this letter, the familiarity of the problems addressed shows the enduring value of the apostolic witness for the correct understanding and conduct of the Christian faith and life.</p>
<p class="ah">18.1.2. Some Questions</p>
<p class="pf">Where Paul was when he wrote 1 Thessalonians is not clear. He does tell his readers that he was in Athens when he sent Timothy on his mission to Thessalonica, but there is no indication that he was still there when he wrote the letter. <a id="pg438" class="calibre3"></a>According to Acts Paul went to Corinth after he left Athens (18:1), but Acts does not mention Timothy’s trip, so that information is not as much help as it might be. Paul may have written the letter from Corinth, but in the absence of evidence all we can do is guess as to his location.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Many scholars accept without question that the letter was written early in Paul’s career, and it is often asserted that 1 Thessalonians is the earliest-written document in the NT. When reasons for this conclusion are given, they tend to be the following:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">• Paul evangelized Thessalonica early in his second missionary journey, and hence the letter must be early. Yet Paul had gone to Philippi before he went to Thessalonica and his letter to Philippi is never regarded as early. In fact, the date of a letter has no relation to when a church was founded; it may be soon thereafter or be delayed for years.</p>
<p class="blf">• There is no formal church organization, which some scholars think indicates a very early date. Yet in fact 1 Thess 5:12–13 does indicate there is already an organization in place.</p>
<p class="blf">• 1 Thess 4:13–18 shows that Paul’s eschatological hope remains vivid, whereas later in his life he saw it would not come as soon as he first thought. But it is equally vivid in 1 Corinthians 15, and even when he writes to the Romans it remains in place (13:11).</p>
<p class="blf">• There is no reference to the collection for the saints in Jerusalem. But as we have seen in the case of Philippians, that may in itself say nothing about when the letter was written, whether before the collection was proposed or after it was delivered, or whether for other reasons it is simply not discussed.</p>
<p class="blf">• Paul makes repeated references to the founding visit, indicating that it was recent. But Paul also refers to his founding visit to Philippi, and that does not mean that that letter is also early.</p>
<p class="blf">• Paul mentions that he has been bereft of the addressees “for a short time” (2:17), indicating that he has only recently been in Thessalonica. Yet he also says that he has been hindered again and again from coming to see them (2:18), so we do not know how long the separation has been.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">There are also a number of indications that the letter was written at a much later time. In addition to the reasons already given, the following points are relevant:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">• Paul tells the Thessalonians that the fame of their faith has spread well beyond Macedonia, so that people tell him about the faith of the Thessalonians before he can mention it (1:7–9). That seems to presume sufficient passage of time for such news to be spread.</p>
<p class="blf">• <a id="pg439" class="calibre3"></a>Paul’s defense of his apostolic practices echoes charges leveled against him in Galatia, namely, that he shaped his gospel to please people, not God (1 Thess 2:4; cf. Gal 1:10), and in Corinth, namely, that he sought by devious means to enrich himself from his preaching (1 Thess 2:5–6; cf. 2 Cor 11:7; 12:16). And in fact these letters to the Galatian and the Corinthian Christians were written later in Paul’s career than the presumed early date of 1 Thessalonians.</p>
<p class="blf">• Much of the letter reminds his readers of what Paul has told them during his original visit, but if it was written shortly after he left, why would he need to do that? The likelihood is that they would have remembered it, especially since he commends them for their faith.</p>
<p class="blf">• Enough people have died to raise the question of what happens to them when Christ comes (4:13–17), and there is no indication that they were martyred as a result of the opposition to the Christians in Thessalonica. That question therefore presumes a longer rather than a shorter period since they became Christians, long enough for enough people to have died of natural causes to raise such a problem.</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">Such evidence does not prove that this letter was written later on in Paul’s career, any more than the evidence cited previously proves that it was his earliest letter. In light of the inconclusiveness of the evidence, it would perhaps be best not to assert as though unquestioned that 1 Thessalonians is the earliest of Paul’s letters. We simply do not have enough evidence to make such an unqualified assertion.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch18ah02"><a href="part0002.html#rch18ah02" class="calibre6">18.2. 2 THESSALONIANS</a></p>
<p class="pf">2 Thessalonians is at least the second letter that Paul wrote to the Thessalonian church (2 Thess 3:15), in addition to yet another letter that claimed falsely to be to be from him (2:2). Since the two letters Paul wrote to the Christians in Thessalonica, as well as the apparent false letter, all include discussion of events accompanying the return of Christ, it is apparent that that event excited the interest of these Christians. It may well be that some Christian group especially concerned about Christ’s return made its ideas and perhaps even its presence felt in Thessalonica.</p>
<p class="ah">18.2.1. The Letter</p>
<p class="pf">Aside from two sections (1:5–12; 2:1–12), the content of this letter is similar to that of 1 Thessalonians. The letter follows the typical format of a Pauline letter, with the letter opening (1:1–2) closer in form to the other letters of Paul (Rom 1:7b; <a id="pg440" class="calibre3"></a>1 Cor 1:2–3; 2 Cor 1:2; Phil 1:2; in slightly altered form in Gal 1:3) than 1 Thess 1:1. This means either that Paul is the author of this second letter to the Christians in Thessalonica and uses here his usual form, or, if in fact Paul was not the author, that whoever wrote it knew from other letters the usual Pauline form. If the author did know other Pauline letters, it is strange that he (or she) is so dependent on 1 Thessalonians.</p>

<div class="glossary">
<p class="en" id="sben02"><a href="part0022.html#rsben02" class="ennum">*</a>The thanksgiving/prayer section contains in 1:4–10 an unusually long preview of the content of the letter body.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">The letter opening also contains, typically for Paul, an opening prayer (1:3–12). As in 1 Thessalonians, the prayer here (1:3, 11–12) is combined with content that belongs more properly in the letter body (1:4–10). Paul often includes in an epistolary prayer some indication of the content of the ensuing letter, but rarely to the extent that he does in both Thessalonian letters. The opening portion of this letter reflects what was apparently a growing persecution of his readers, and Paul seeks to comfort them and give them courage to withstand by reciting the dreadful consequences those who persecute Christians will receive at Christ’s return. Paul refers often enough to the coming wrath of God, but rarely in such explicit detail. The return of Jesus will mean affliction for those who afflict the Christians, and their destruction and exclusion from the presence of God. The language and concepts here are closer to what one finds in the Johannine Apocalypse than to material found elsewhere in the Pauline letters, but it does show how extensive such views in fact were within the early Christian movement.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter body itself (2:1–3:16) is divided into two parts (2:1–17; 3:1–16), each of which closes with a benediction (2:16–17; 3:16). The first half of the letter body is instructional in nature; the second half (3:1–16) is more hortatory in character. We shall look at each in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Continuing with the topic of the return of Christ (2:1–12), Paul next discusses a problem that has arisen among his readers. From some source — Paul is <a id="pg441" class="calibre3"></a>not sure whether through some Spirit-inspired prophecy or a letter forged in his name (2:2b) — the rumor has spread that Christ has already returned. Some Christians are apparently concerned about how they should assemble to greet Christ when he shows up in Thessalonica. Paul has already spoken of the course of events to occur when Christ returns (1 Thess 4:16–17), but even in the absence of such events, some of his readers, at least, are apparently worrying that the event may have occurred without their knowing it. In response, Paul indicates some of the reasons that it cannot have happened yet, namely, because some events that must precede Christ’s return have themselves not yet happened.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is difficult to fathom the exact meaning of Paul’s description of these events, because he is reminding his readers of things he has already told them (2:5). As a result, he does not need to go into great detail identifying whom or what he means by such things as the “lawless human being,” also called the “son of perdition” (2:3), who will apparently oppose all religious functions (2:4) and, by seating himself in the temple in Jerusalem, will declare himself to be God. Some have thought this may be a reference to Emperor Caligula’s attempt in 39–41 <small class="calibre9">CE</small> to set up a statue of himself in the Jerusalem temple (cf. Mark 13:14), but Paul is speaking here of events that have not yet occurred and has in mind the final enemy of God rather than some human usurper. For that reason some have seen here a reference to the heavenly temple and a war in heaven against God, which resulted in persecution of Christians on earth (as in Rev 13:7–17), but Paul’s identification of this opponent as a “human being” (Greek <em class="calibre5">anthr<span class="dcrit">ō</span>pos</em>) would tend to rule out such an idea.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Since this “lawless person” must appear before Christ returns, the Thessalonians need not yet worry whether in fact Christ’s return has already taken place. Paul grants that the “mystery of lawlessness” is already at work; witness the persecution of Christians. But some force is at present restraining the “lawless person” from appearing before the proper time. Although the term “Antichrist” is not used here, it is probably such a figure that Paul has in mind. The identity of “the one who restrains” (or “that which restrains”) is also known to the Thessalonian Christians (2:6), so that we are not told who or what that is. Finally, however, this “lawless one” will be revealed once the restraining one is set aside, and then the full satanic force of the lawless one will be revealed in a final cataclysm of evil. At that point, Jesus will return and destroy this Antichrist with the “breath of his mouth.” Thus it is evident that the Antichrist is no match for Christ, who will kill him merely by blowing on him. As a result, the readers need not fear for their ultimate destiny; it is in the hands of the One who at the appropriate time will have no problem in eliminating all threat of evil from the world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">These final events will be accompanied by what appear to be miraculous events (2:9), and many will be deceived. That many were already opposing the Christian communities may explain why, even though Paul had told them these <a id="pg442" class="calibre3"></a>events, some Christians in Thessalonica thought their suffering indicated that the lawless one was already exercising final power. Paul is reminding his readers of what they already know, which deprives us of the explanation we would need in order to know exactly what events he is describing. Any attempt to penetrate that veil must be based on speculation. We simply do not know what Paul is referring to. The intention of the passage is not so much to provide a timetable as to warn the readers that, although the return of Christ is imminent, certain events must first occur. In this it shares the intention of the “little apocalypse” in Mark 13 (e.g., vv. 7, 24–27).</p>
<p class="calibre8">The final section of the first half of the letter body (2:13–15) assures the readers that they belong among those who will not be deceived, because they have heard and accepted the truth at the time of their conversion. Their task in the present, therefore, is to hold fast to the truth they have already heard from Paul, whether when he was present or in his letters. The benediction that concludes the first half of the letter body (2:16–17) prays that the divine comfort and hope based on God’s grace will continue to sustain the readers in the midst of the persecution they are undergoing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The second half of the letter body (3:1–16) concerns itself with some problems that have arisen as a result of the confusion about the precise time of Christ’s return. After an opening paragraph (3:1–5) in which Paul asks for prayer that he may be delivered from those who oppose him and in which he assures his readers that God will continue to lead and comfort them, Paul turns to the problem of idleness among some of the Christians in Thessalonica. He touched very briefly on this problem in his first letter to this community (1 Thess 5:14), but it has apparently grown in the meantime into a significant problem. Evidently, on the supposition that Christ either had already returned or would in the immediate future, some of the Thessalonian Christians decided that it was not worth working any more, since the whole world would soon end. Such persons were proving to be a burden on the other Christians, both in their ideas and in their imposition on the earnings of others for their food. Paul reminds the readers both of what he said in his visit to them (3:6b) and of his own example: He earned his own keep while preaching to them the gospel of Jesus Christ (3:7–8). He did this not because he had no right to be supported by his converts, but precisely to give them this example. He repeats what he has told them before: Those who do not work have no right to eat the food of those who do (3:10). Furthermore, such people who refuse to work have too much time on their hands and so become busybodies. To all such Paul solemnly commands, by the authority of Jesus Christ, that they work to support themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s final word (3:14–15) is a warning to the readers to have nothing to do with those who continue in their misguided paths despite what Paul has written. The idea is not to punish or reject such people. It is, rather, to make them ashamed <a id="pg443" class="calibre3"></a>of their misguided conduct (3:14b). So one should act toward them as toward a wayward member of the family rather than as toward an outsider and enemy. Paul closes the second half of the letter body as he did the first half, with a benediction (3:16).</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the letter closing (3:17–18) Paul, switching the personal reference from “we” to “I,” gives his readers a means of differentiating his authentic letters from those that are not from him, namely, a sample of his handwriting. The inclusion after that statement of the final wish for grace (3:18) may indicate that Paul regularly wrote the concluding wish in his own hand (cf. 1 Cor 16:23; Gal 6:18) even where he does not specifically call attention to it (see 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 4:23; 1 Thess 5:28; Phlm 25). That phrase would then serve the function of authenticating Paul’s letters, much as a signature does in a modern letter; since the name of the person sending an ancient letter was given first, there was no reason for a signature at the end.</p>
<p class="ah">18.2.2. Some Questions</p>
<p class="pf">2 Thessalonians is in some ways so very much like 1 Thessalonians but in other ways so very different that scholars have raised questions about its authorship. Why would Paul have written two letters to the same community, repeating some points almost verbatim and giving what looks like very different advice on others? Some of the major objections to authorship by Paul are the following:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">1. The style and vocabulary are somewhat different from those of 1 Thessalonians. The warmth Paul apparently felt for the Christians in Thessalonica expressed in the first letter is gone in the second, and in its place there is a formality of tone not usually used when writing to close friends. There are also a number of words used here that do not appear in other Pauline letters, but that is also the case in most of Paul’s letters. Taken in themselves, differences in style and vocabulary are rarely sufficient to rule out Paul as author.</p>
<p class="blf">2. That the same persons are identified as senders (Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy) as in 1 Thessalonians indicates that this letter was written a short time after the sending of the first. In that event, the close literary relationship between the two letters and the repetition of content are somewhat strange.</p>
<p class="blf">3. The signs that will precede Christ’s second coming named in 2 Thess 2:1–12 are nowhere else mentioned by Paul, and the fact that such observable events seem to contradict Paul’s claim in the first letter that there would be no such signs (1 Thess 5:2) may point to someone other than Paul as author. Yet both ideas — observable events preceding the coming of the Messiah and the suddenness of the events — are held in apocalyptic Judaism, which influenced <a id="pg444" class="calibre3"></a>Paul and other early Christians in these matters. Paul is apparently reminding his readers of what he told them when he was with them (2:5). Also to be noted are the different situations addressed. In the first letter the problem is potential despair over the long delay in Christ’s return; in the second letter the problem is anxiety about the fact that Christ may already have returned. The two problems require different solutions.</p>
<p class="blf">4. Certain characteristics of 2 Thessalonians seem to point away from Paul as author, such as:</p>
<p class="sbul">a. The thanksgiving that opens the letter (1:3–12) becomes didactic in character, abandoning its role as prayer. Yet we noted the same problem in 1 Thessalonians, with the difficulty of determining where the prayer ended and the letter body began.</p>
<p class="sbul">b. The letter closing (3:17–18) no longer points to intimacy but to validation of the letter. Yet the need to validate the letter is not surprising if, as Paul suspects, a letter is circulating in his name that he did not write (2:12).</p>
<p class="sbul">c. 2 Thess 1:1–2a repeats 1 Thess 1:1, which makes it appear that the author of the second letter is dependent on the literary form of the first, unlikely if Paul is the author of both. Yet the letter opening is a Pauline stereotype, and in fact the salutation in the second letter (1:2) is more in accord with normal Pauline practice than the salutation in the first letter (1:1).</p>
<p class="sbul">d. The use of the word “tradition,” unusual in Paul, and the emphasis on following tradition (2:15; 3:6) are characteristics of a time after the death of Paul, when apostolic tradition began to be structured as a series of doctrines. Yet Paul also reports traditions he taught his readers in other, uncontested letters (1 Cor 11:23; 15:3), and he can refer to the standard of doctrine to which Christians have been committed (Rom 6:17).</p>
<p class="sbul">e. The discussion in 2 Thess 3:6–12 shows a literary dependence on 1 Thess 2:9 and 5:14a. Yet the material in the second letter appears to reflect a problem that has worsened since the writing of the first, and the phrase “worked night and day that we might not burden any of you” is the kind of stereotyped phrase Paul would use again and again in defending this practice, a defense also found in the Corinthians correspondence.</p>
<p class="sbul">f. If the “man of lawlessness” refers to the myth that Nero, arch-enemy of the Christians, would come back to life, then the letter must have been written after Nero’s suicide in 68 <small class="calibre9">CE</small> and hence is not from Paul. Yet the identification of Nero <em class="calibre5">redivivus</em> with the man of lawlessness is itself pure speculation.</p>
<p class="sbul">g. The mention of forged letters (2:2; cf. 3:17) points to a later period when such forgeries began to appear. Yet this is a problem only if 1 Thessalonians is Paul’s first letter. In fact, these references add <a id="pg445" class="calibre3"></a>confirmation to the idea that 1 Thessalonians was written later, rather than earlier, in Paul’s career, when Paul was better known as a letter writer.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">On the whole, the question of authorship remains open, with evidence pointing in both directions, as was also the case with Colossians. While no certainty is achievable, it does seem on the whole that a good case can be made for Paul as the author of this second letter to the Christian community in Thessalonica.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If this second letter to the Thessalonians was in fact written by Paul, then the readers will very likely be the same group of Gentile Christians to whom the first letter was addressed. Some have suggested that the similarities and differences between the two letters can be explained if the first letter were written to Gentile Christians and the second to Jewish Christians, perhaps even to Jewish Christians who lived in another city (e.g., Beroea, Acts 17:10–12), but there is no evidence to sustain such speculation. It is highly likely that Paul is writing to the same readers to whom the first letter was addressed, responding to a changed situation there.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When and from where the letter was written will be largely determined by the identity of the author. If it was written by Paul, then it was written close enough in time to the first letter that Timothy and Silvanus are still with Paul. The existence of a forged letter bearing Paul’s name (2 Thess 2:2) and the need to validate 2 Thessalonians as a genuine Pauline letter (3:17) would indicate a time when Paul was recognized as an authoritative apostle, more likely a time later in his career than earlier. In fact, as we have seen, these points also indicate that 1 Thessalonians was written at a time later than many scholars have posited. Some have argued that the reference to the Jerusalem temple (2 Thess 2:4) indicates that the letter comes from before the destruction of the temple in 70 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>. Yet Paul was apparently executed prior to the temple’s destruction, so such a reference could have come at any time during his apostolic career, and a forger could have included that reference to make the letter seem to have been written earlier than in fact it was. Thus the reference to the temple adds nothing to our determination of a date. If, on the other hand, 2 Thessalonians was not written by Paul, then we have no idea when it was written. Those who question Pauline authorship tend to date it in the 80s of the first century.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The same holds true for the letter’s place of origin. If it was written by Paul, the likelihood is that it was written from the same place as 1 Thessalonians, perhaps Athens or Corinth. Some have suggested that Paul’s need to be delivered from evil opponents (2 Thess 3:2) could point to Corinth (cf. 2 Corinthians 10–13) or even Ephesus (2 Cor 1:8–10). On the other hand, if Paul did not write it, we have no idea of its place of origin. There are no hints in the letter itself on that point, and any proposed solution will be purely speculative.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Some have suggested that 2 Thess 2:1–12, because of its supposedly unPauline character, has been inserted into a letter by Paul. But there is no textual <a id="pg446" class="calibre3"></a>evidence to support this suggestion, so that it has not found widespread agreement. Aside from transcriptional errors arising from hand copying, there appear to be no real challenges to the integrity of the text as we now have it.</p>
