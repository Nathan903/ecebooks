<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch14" class="calibre6">The Letter to the Galatians</a></p>
<p class="pf">No other letter of Paul shows the apostle involved in what he so clearly takes to be a life-and-death struggle for the faith of one of his missionary churches. To be sure, the difficulties confronting him in Corinth threatened his influence in those communities and hence, in his mind, the validity of the gospel they originally received. Yet nowhere does one get the impression that the threat there to the existence of a valid faith in Jesus Christ cut to the very core of the gospel. In this letter to the Christians in Galatia, on the other hand, Paul is clearly fighting for the very soul of the churches there. It appears from the content of the letter that some people have come to the Galatian churches and have announced to them a very different Christian gospel from the one Paul proclaimed. Adherence to the Jewish traditions of law and circumcision was much more important to these “teachers” who had come to Galatia than it was to Paul, to the point that they apparently argued that Paul had not given to the Galatians the whole, true gospel. These “teachers” argued that one could not realize the promises of Christ if one were not a practicing Jew so that one could follow in the footsteps of Abraham, to whom God had originally given the promise of blessing. Thus one had to have both faith in Christ and adherence to the law of Moses, including circumcision, if one were to inherit the promise given to Abraham and realized in Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">From this letter it is clear, according to Paul’s understanding of the gospel, that if the interpretation of the gospel represented by these “teachers” who sought to undermine Paul’s preaching prevailed, the Galatian Christians would have thus succumbed to a perversion of the true gospel of Jesus Christ. This Paul was unwilling to let happen. For that reason, we see Paul at his most combative in this letter to his converts in Galatia.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch14ah01"><a id="pg356" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch14ah01" class="calibre6">14.1. THE LETTER</a></p>
<p class="pf">Thematic to Paul’s letter to the “churches of Galatia” is Paul’s conviction that a right relationship with God is possible only through a trusting relationship to God based on God’s act in Christ, not through reliance on one’s Jewish heritage demonstrated by undergoing the rite of circumcision and keeping the law.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The point of Paul’s discussion of the law and the Jewish heritage here is therefore different from that in Romans. There the point was to insure that the Jewish heritage of the Christian faith not be ignored by non-Jews who became Christian. This is shown in Rom 1:2–5, with its emphasis on the Jewish lineage of Jesus, and continued in such passages as 3:1–8; 3:31–4:22; and chs. 9–11, especially 11:13–32. The point in Galatians, on the other hand, is to insure that the Jewish heritage not be substituted for, or added as a necessary adjunct to, trust in God through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus, in Galatians, reliance on the Jewish heritage (law and circumcision) and trust in God through Jesus Christ (the gospel) are held to be mutually exclusive. To rely on one is to exclude the other, as Paul makes explicit in 5:2–4. If the need to respect the Jewish history underlying Jesus and the gospel is emphasized in Romans, the danger of placing too much reliance on it is emphasized in Galatians. The problem inherent in relying on “works of the law” for a right relationship with God is not whether a sinful human being can earn a right relationship with God through “good works.” Given Paul’s view of the power of sin entrenched through human rebellion against God, such a thought would not have crossed his mind. Furthermore, his term is not “good works” but “works of the law,” that is, faithful observance of the law of Moses. Such observance characterizes the Jewish heritage, for it was the Jewish people to whom the law was given. To rely on the law therefore implied reliance on one’s Jewish heritage, including observance of the law, to the exclusion of total reliance on Christ. For Paul, anything that usurped the place of total and utter reliance on God’s grace through Christ for a right relationship with God is in fact impermissible for those who want to accept the apostolic gospel. Such were the implications of Paul’s apocalyptic gospel, in which the death and resurrection of Jesus signaled the beginning of the new age. Dissuading the Galatian Christians from believing that it was necessary to add to trust in God through Christ a trust in the Jewish heritage by incorporating themselves into that heritage through circumcision and law is the burden of this epistle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">That Paul regards such an addition to faith in Christ as presenting a singular danger for the Christian gospel is clear from the beginning of the letter, because he does not follow his usual form for the letter opening. In his normal opening he mentions himself and his co-senders and then his addressees, and he wishes grace and peace for them. If any of those elements are amplified — for example, if Paul says more about his apostleship — it is usually in terms of his being chosen by <a id="pg357" class="calibre3"></a>God (so 1 and 2 Corinthians; cf. Romans). Paul’s prayer of thanksgiving for his readers then follows, in keeping with the practice even in secular letters of the time. Finally, Paul regularly includes a prayer for the well-being of the letter’s recipients.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The opening of Galatians differs from this normal opening in two significant ways. First, the amplification of Paul’s apostleship is negative. Apparently Paul felt that he could not presume, as he did in every other epistle, even where some were questioning his authority (e.g., 1 and 2 Corinthians), that those to whom he was writing would admit his legitimacy as an apostle. With the very first words in Galatians, Paul is involved in defending his apostleship against the accusation that it derived not from God but from some human commission. Thus it is clear from the outset that one of the reasons Paul wrote this epistle was to defend himself against charges that he was not truly an apostle.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre8">Second, Paul does not include a prayer of thanksgiving in this letter. In every other letter, Paul includes such a prayer, even when his main object is correction (2 Corinthians). In every other Christian community to which Paul wrote, therefore, he could find something in his readers’ situation to thank God for. But now he can apparently find no such happy element, or at any rate he did not think it appropriate to express it. This is another indication of how seriously Paul took the problem with which the Galatian Christians confronted him, and it makes clear that a second reason Paul wrote this epistle was to correct a viewpoint that strikes <a id="pg358" class="calibre3"></a>so much at the heart of the gospel that, were it to prevail, the readers would in his view cease to be Christians.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Since the attacks on the legitimacy of Paul’s apostleship and of the gospel he preached were so closely related, he begins by defending his gospel (1:6–10), a defense that then immediately shifts (1:11) into a prolonged defense of the legitimacy of his apostleship (1:12–2:10).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul begins his defense by declaring that the gospel proclaimed among the Galatians by the invading “teachers” is in fact no gospel at all. Since his gospel was the good news of the sole sufficiency of Christ as God’s way of delivering humanity from the burden of sin (so already 1:4), any other version of how humanity is to be so delivered can only be characterized, not as “a <em class="calibre5">different</em> gospel,” but as a perversion of the gospel, since aside from Paul’s message there is no other gospel (1:6–7). Anyone who tries to preach something other than what Paul first preached to them, even if that preacher is Paul himself or even an angel (!), will be accursed, because what they say is a perversion of the gospel (vv. 8–9). To show how serious he is about it and to make sure there is no misunderstanding on the point, Paul repeats the assertion (v. 9).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul then raises a question about himself (v. 10) and his motives that gives every indication of being one of the accusations leveled against him by the “Preachers” (we will use this term from v. 8 to identify these opponents) who had come to Galatia and who opposed Paul as apostle and preacher. As in the Corinthian correspondence, Paul quotes a view he opposes, and then corrects it. By noting where he does this, we can to a large extent reconstruct the attacks against Paul. We will do so in the following discussion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Here, the accusation seems to have been that Paul watered down the true gospel to make it more appealing to his listeners, thus “trying to please humans” rather than God (v. 10). Perhaps Paul’s opponents said that he made the gospel easier to accept by ignoring the requirements of the Jewish heritage expressed in the commands of the law, especially circumcision (Paul will return to this later). Included in this may have been the implication that Paul never had been a very good Jew, and hence it was not hard for him to abandon law and circumcision.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s response to this latter accusation is to point to his life prior to his apostolic commission, a time when he was so devoted to his Jewish heritage that he persecuted Christians. Paul had advanced in his knowledge of Judaism and devotion to the “traditions of the fathers” far beyond many of his contemporaries (vv. 13–14). Let there be no claim, therefore, that Paul had lacked zeal for his Jewish traditions, or that he had not valued them highly!</p>
<p class="calibre8">There was a further implication in that accusation, however, and that was the charge that because Paul’s gospel reflects his concern that his gospel be pleasing to his listeners, it must be because Paul’s gospel has a human rather than a divine source. As he begins to meet that objection, Paul reaffirms (v. 11) what he said at <a id="pg359" class="calibre3"></a>the very outset of the letter (v. 1), namely, that his apostleship was not of human derivation. Paul then recites important events in his life to demonstrate the falsity of such a charge.</p>
<p class="calibre8">He begins with his conversion, which, he notes, involved from the outset his preaching to Gentiles. He thus implies here that his conversion and his commission to go to the Gentiles came at the same time and from the same source. Interestingly, one could infer from the accounts of Paul’s conversion in Acts that he received his first instruction in the Christian faith from the Christians in Damascus who took him in after he had met the risen Christ and had been struck blind (Acts 9:8–19), that there he received his commission to go to the Gentiles (Acts 22:10, 14–15), and that subsequently (“after many days,” Acts 9:23) he went to the disciples in Jerusalem to learn more about the Jesus he had never seen (Acts 9:26–28).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul will have none of that. He insists that he has in fact been commissioned by the risen Lord (vv. 11–12; see 1 Cor 9:1) and that, immediately following that commission, he was not where he could have been instructed about the gospel by any of those who had been called to be apostles before him. Not only did he not go to Jerusalem, he left Palestine altogether for “Arabia” (probably the area to the east of Palestine), and when he returned, it was to Damascus, not Jerusalem (vv. 15–17). In fact, he did not go to Jerusalem until a full three years after he had returned to Damascus, and then he met only two of the disciples, Peter and James. The implication is clear: how could Paul be accused of having gotten his Christianity secondhand? How could he have received his commission from another Christian if he did not meet another Christian until three years or more after he became an apostle? Paul could therefore not have been dependent on the disciples for his initial knowledge of Christ and the Christian way.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It may well be that part of the “Preachers’” claim was that they represented the Christian faith as it was proclaimed by the disciples in Jerusalem. Since, they argued, Paul was dependent on those disciples for his knowledge of the faith and had misunderstood them, it was necessary for the Galatians to listen to the “Preachers” rather than to Paul and his false, misunderstood gospel. That Paul’s account here is getting to the heart of the false information circulated about him is indicated by his oath before God that he is telling the truth (1:20). Anything that disagrees with his account is therefore necessarily false.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After he left Jerusalem, Paul says that he went to regions far to the north. As a result, the churches in Judea knew about him only by report, not by sight (1:21–24), having had no opportunity to meet him. Thus not only did he not get his understanding of the faith and his commission from disciples, neither did he get it from any others in Judea who may have been eyewitnesses to Jesus’ career. Thus Paul leaves no opening for the “Preachers” to say he got his commission from anyone other than the risen Jesus himself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Not until fourteen years later was Paul in Judea again. This might mean <a id="pg360" class="calibre3"></a>fourteen years after his return to Damascus (1:17), but fourteen years after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian (1:18) is more likely. And still he did not go at the behest of the authorities in Jerusalem; he went up “by revelation” (2:2a), that is, because it was God’s will, not the will of the disciples in Jerusalem. Paul’s gospel was thus not derived from other people, either in its origin or in the way it affected his life as apostle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was therefore only at that advanced point in his career as apostle, during this second visit to Jerusalem, that Paul explained to the Christian authorities there what he was preaching to Gentiles. And it was quite acceptable to them! This is major point for Paul. Not only did he not get his original commission from these authorities, but, when he finally did meet them, they had nothing to add to what he was saying. Equally importantly, they did not even require Titus, a Greek, and hence a Gentile Christian, to take on the yoke of the law through circumcision.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is at this point that we come to perhaps the major area of disagreement in Galatians between Paul and the “Preachers” who opposed his gospel: they apparently said that his gospel of the sole sufficiency of trust in God’s grace in Christ was insufficient. To gain God’s full favor, one also had to participate fully in the Jewish heritage, that is, be circumcised and assume the “full yoke of the law.” Their argument appears to have been: if Paul had genuine Christianity and understood it correctly, he would also require circumcision and adherence to the law, since that is what the Christian authorities in Jerusalem require. Hence, the “Preachers” insisted that if the Galatians wanted to be fully Christian, they too had to be fully under the Jewish law.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul combats their view by reciting his own history with the authorities in Jerusalem. Although “false apostles” insisted that Titus be circumcised, Paul resisted, and the authorities approved his understanding of the Christian faith. With this recitation, the tables are turned. Those who claim Paul is false for not requiring Christians to be fully under the law are themselves now shown to represent a view of Christianity not in accord with that of the Jerusalem authorities (2:1–5).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul drives his point home (2:6–10). Not only did those of repute in Jerusalem find no fault with his gospel (they saw nothing to be added to it), they were in fact so impressed by what he had to say that they admitted he had as much right to preach to Gentiles as Peter had to preach to Jews (v. 8). Let Paul’s opponents consider that: in mission, the authorities in Jerusalem, whose authority the “Preachers” themselves invoked, put Paul on the same apostolic level as Peter himself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s meetings with the authorities in Jerusalem, therefore, ended in concord. Far from finding any fault with Paul’s gospel, the Jerusalem authorities acknowledged the legitimacy of his proclamation by offering him the right hand of fellowship. So they would oversee the Christian mission to the Jews, while he would continue his mission to the Gentiles. He does concede that they had one <a id="pg361" class="calibre3"></a>request, namely that he have his Gentile Christians help the Christians in Jerusalem (“the poor” was apparently their own self-designation) financially. To that stipulation, Paul says, he readily agreed.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Paul’s Opponents in Galatia</p>
<p class="sbaft">A summary of the position of Paul’s opponents in Galatia would probably have looked like this:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="sbulf">• Paul is not a real apostle: he was not a follower of the earthly Jesus and so is dependent on others for his knowledge of Jesus and for his commission as an apostle.</p>
<p class="sbulf">• Therefore, he is dependent on the disciples in Jerusalem for his gospel and for his commission as apostle, and so is subordinate to them.</p>
<p class="sbulf">• Paul has misunderstood his secondhand Christianity.</p>
<p class="sbul">— He has wrongly jettisoned the Jewish heritage (the law) because he himself was never really a good Jew.</p>
<p class="sbul">— Because God gave his promise to Abraham, only the heirs of Abraham will inherit that blessing (see <a href="part0007.html#ch03" class="calibre3">ch. 3</a>). Hence one must be Jew to obtain God’s blessing.</p>
<p class="sbul">— Therefore, the correct Christian position is not Christ <em class="calibre5">or</em> law but Christ <em class="calibre5">and</em> law (see <a href="part0009.html#ch05" class="calibre3">ch. 5</a>).</p>
</div>
<p class="sbo">This is the position Paul argues against in his letter to the Galatian churches.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Having recited part of his history to refute charges against the legitimacy of his apostleship and the gospel he proclaims, Paul shifts the focus of the discussion (2:11–21). Still telling of his own history, Paul now turns to a defense of the heart of his gospel, namely the total sufficiency of trust in Christ as the way to obtain God’s blessing. Paul understood the attack by the “Preachers” on this point as an attack on the core meaning of God’s act in Christ, since for Paul (cf. 5:4), “grace” and “Christ” point to the same reality. But, even more — since Christ is God’s grace personified — this attack against the complete sufficiency of Christ is an attack against God himself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">For his defense of the all-sufficiency of grace (i.e., God’s promised blessing) through trust in Christ, Paul turns to an account of his confrontation of Peter at <a id="pg362" class="calibre3"></a>Antioch, which goes to the heart of his dispute with the “Preachers.” For a time, Paul says, Peter had admitted that trust in Christ was the sole important point in Christianity. Peter did so by his actions, that is, by eating with Gentiles (2:12a; cf. Acts 10). But then some people came “from James,” that is, from the one who was now leading the church in Jerusalem. Paul also identifies them as the “circumcision party,” so they evidently said that Gentiles needed to become Jews to obtain God’s blessing. Peter then withdrew from table fellowship with Gentiles. Such fellowship was forbidden to Jews by the law, since it would involve eating impure (i.e., non-kosher) food.</p>
<p class="calibre8">By leaving the table, Peter demonstrated the very problem Paul would come to face in Galatia: the belief that one needed to be a Jew (and to prove so by <a id="pg363" class="calibre3"></a>obedience to whole law) to obtain God’s blessing given in Christ. Because Paul’s argument against Peter in these verses is at the same time his argument against his opponents’ charge that he preaches an incomplete gospel by not requiring Gentile converts to Christianity to become Jews, it is not clear where he leaves off quoting what he said to Peter and begins to address the Galatians directly. That is not so important as it might otherwise be, however, since his answer to one is his answer to the others.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Separation at Table</p>
<p class="sbaft">The following excerpts from Jewish documents of the first century or earlier reflect contemporary interpretation of the OT commands to be separate from the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="sb">From <em class="calibre5">Jubilees,</em> a document dating to either the first century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> or the first century <small class="calibre9">CE</small>:</p>
<div class="senseline">
<p class="sbslf">And you also, my son, Jacob, remember my words,</p>
<p class="sbsl">and keep the commandments of Abraham, your father.</p>
<p class="sbsl">Separate yourself from the gentiles,</p>
<p class="sbsl">and do not eat with them,</p>
<p class="sbsl">and do not perform deeds like theirs.</p>
<p class="sbsl">And do not become associates of theirs.</p>
<p class="sbsl">Because their deeds are defiled,</p>
<p class="sbsl">and all of their ways are contaminated, and despicable,</p>
<p class="sl2">and abominable.</p>
<p class="sbslt">(22:16, <em class="calibre5">OTP</em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="sb">In the first-century romance called <em class="calibre5">Joseph and Aseneth,</em> Joseph’s piety is described in terms of his refusal to eat with Gentiles:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">And Joseph entered the house of Pentephres and sat upon the throne. And they washed his feet and set a table before him by itself, because Joseph never ate with the Egyptians, for this was an abomination to him. (7:1, <em class="calibre5">OTP</em>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">He points out that as a result of Peter’s abandoning table fellowship with non-Jewish Christians even the trusted Barnabas, who had accompanied Paul on his second visit to Jerusalem, also withdrew from such fellowship. Paul saw the kind of consequences this could have in other Christian churches. It would lead to a split within the Christian community between Jews and Gentiles and to recriminations among fellow Christians, something, Paul points out later, that was already happening in Galatia (5:15).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s argument at this point is compact and complex and needs considerable unpacking if we are to understand it. It is worth the effort, however, since what Paul says will show us not only the key point around which his argument in Galatians revolves, but also some central elements in his understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s first point against Peter’s action is that there is little point in trying to make Gentile Christians act like Jews, as the “people from James” evidently wanted to do, because, says Paul, even Jewish Christians act like Gentiles rather than like Jews. He is not referring here to Peter’s earlier table fellowship with Gentile Christians, because that Peter had repudiated. Paul is referring to something far closer to the heart of the matter (2:15–16).</p>
<p class="calibre8">He points out that even those who were born Jews and are thus not “Gentile sinners,” as Jews liked to call them — even such Jews have realized, when they became Christians, that there is no hope for Jews as Jews of getting right with God. By becoming Christians they acknowledged that their Jewish heritage, including the law, was not sufficient. Paul is thus pointing to the crux of what Christians really are: those who have realized that their only hope for a right relationship with God lies in abandoning trust in their Jewish heritage and seeking that relationship with God through Christ. When Jewish Christians did that, they had, in fact, abandoned the heritage that had marked them as Jews. So Paul is referring here (2:14) to Peter’s original decision to follow Christ and his recognition that the law could not put him in a right relationship with God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Again we must note that when Paul speaks of “works of the law” he is not referring to earning merit in God’s eyes with good works. He refers, rather, to works done in obedience to the law. Since the law was given to Israel, to rely on doing the law is tantamount in the end to trusting in one’s ethnic identity as a Jew for God’s favor, since only the Jews, those who have the law, can observe its tenets. If one <a id="pg364" class="calibre3"></a>does that, Paul argues, one does not trust Christ, who alone can bring one into a right relation to God. The matter at issue here is the source of that right relationship: is it ethnic identity or is it trust in Christ? It cannot be both. Paul’s protracted discussion of who constitute the true heirs of Abraham shows that the point is here Jewish heritage, not earning favor with God by following the moral requirements of the law.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus, Paul’s argument against Peter is this: we Jews who became Christians have by that act admitted that our Jewish heritage was not sufficient for our relationship with God, and hence we abandoned reliance on that heritage, and with it the law. From that point of view, all Christians live like Gentiles, not like Jews, because Christians no longer rely on the law and all it represents, but on Christ to make them right with God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus, those Jews who see true righteousness in Christ, not in the law, must turn fully to Christ and abandon reliance on the law, because that law (2:16) cannot make one right with God. To put it another way, Paul is arguing that to share in the Jewish heritage does not mean to be automatically in a right relationship with God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If that is the case, then Christians are on the same level as non-Jews in the eyes of the law; they are outside the circle of those who rely on the Jewish ethnic heritage and thus are on a level with the “Gentile sinners” mentioned in 2:15. This is Paul’s point in 2:17 — those who seek to be right with God through Christ are, as far as the law is concerned, on a level with Gentile sinners. Thus, in the eyes of Jews, they appear as sinners. Paul’s grammatical emphasis, “even <em class="calibre5">we ourselves</em> are found as sinners,” indicates that he is thinking of the “sinners” in v. 15.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul is thus again pointing out that to seek for one’s righteousness in Christ means at one and same time to abandon Jewish heritage and law and thus to act as Gentiles, not as Jews (v. 14). That being the case, he asks (2:17): does our equation of ourselves with “Gentile sinners” by seeking righteousness in Christ, not in the law, mean that Christ has become a servant of sin, since it is because of him that Jewish Christians have abandoned the law and thus put themselves on a level with Gentile sinners? Of course not, among other reasons because of the close link between the law and sin (2:16); until one turns to Christ one is mired in that sin. But the further reason Paul gives in 2:18 is just the point he is making both to Peter, who returned to the law, and to the Galatians, who want to do likewise. Paul points out that the only sin for Christians, Jewish or Gentile, as far as the law is concerned, is to return to that law after they have become Christians. Only if I return to my former state, Paul says, namely relying on my ethnic heritage rather than on Christ for my right relationship with God, do I constitute myself a sinner with respect to the law. Yet even then, it is not Christ who brings sin, but I who bring it on myself. Christ is thus not an agent of sin in causing Christians to abandon the law, because the only sin for Christians in relation to the law is to deny the <a id="pg365" class="calibre3"></a>all-sufficiency of Christ and return to that law as the basis for a right relationship with God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus Paul has made his point with Peter: when you became a follower of Christ, you abandoned the law and thus become like a Gentile. But you cannot escape the subsequent burden of being on a level with Gentile “sinners” (<em class="calibre5">vis-à-vis</em> the law) by returning to trust in that law, because that very act is to deny Christ and hence to revert to rebellion against God. That is why Paul has asked (2:14): how can you want Gentiles to trust in the Jewish heritage, including the law, when Jews who have become Christians have themselves by that act abandoned that heritage?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul drives his point home (2:19–20): reliance on the law is over for the Christian. The Christian has died to the law as surely as Christ has; that is the meaning of baptism. But this was in fact in accord with the very purpose of the law (2:19). For the Christian, the law has served its purpose: it has demonstrated that one cannot escape sin by means of the law. In fact, following the law leads to sin by fostering rebellion against God through the rejection of Christ and the retention of the law. Therefore Paul has argued: just as surely as Christ died to the law, so the Christian has died to the law. But that means further that Christ is now the one who really lives in the Christian. Thus Christ, not the law, is the principle of the Christian’s life. The conduct of that life can be determined only by Christ, by whose life the Christian lives (2:20).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul then returns (2:21) to what was apparently a further accusation leveled against him, namely, that by abandoning trust in the heritage of the chosen people, Paul had abandoned God’s own grace shown to that people (Paul will argue this point more fully beginning at 3:6). On the contrary, Paul asserts, those who want to return to that heritage abandon God’s true grace in Christ, because in so doing they claim a grace from their Jewish heritage that in fact can come only through Christ. They rob the death of Christ of its significance, since Christ’s death was unnecessary if grace comes not from it but from the Jewish heritage. Hence the alternative: <em class="calibre5">either</em> Christ <em class="calibre5">or</em> law. The possibility of Christ <em class="calibre5">and</em> law, Paul argues, means to deny the significance of Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul has now made his central point and has done so in relation to his dispute with Peter but with the Galatian controversy in mind. He next turns directly to the Galatians (3:1) to drive home the point he has made. He will do this in a variety of ways, but always to the same end, namely to show that the Christian cannot both rely on the law (i.e., become Jewish by circumcision and thus appeal to one’s heritage as a descendant of Abraham) and remain one who trusts in Christ. One will trust either in Christ or in one’s heritage; one cannot trust in both, for that is to deny the critical significance of Christ’s death.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul wonders how any people who had had Christ presented to them as vividly as the Galatians had, could abandon that Christ. Paul raises a key question <a id="pg366" class="calibre3"></a>(3:2): did the evidence of God’s presence — the Spirit — come from “works of the law” (i.e., from relying on Jewish heritage) or “hearing with faith” (i.e., from trusting in the gospel Paul preached)? The answer is obvious: when Paul was there and the Spirit came, law was nowhere in evidence. Are you so stupid, Paul asks, that, beginning with God’s Spirit, which you received by faith, you are going to return to the arena of the law, namely sinful flesh? Are you going to begin at the top and work downward? That would mean your decision to accept Christ is nullified. How does the presence of God (the Spirit) come, by trust or by law? by reliance on one’s Jewish heritage or by trust in God’s promise in Christ?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now if, as the “Preachers” have apparently argued, the key to God’s promise is who is to inherit it through Abraham, Paul must next examine Abraham to see what kind of promised blessing is under discussion (3:6–9). Abraham, Paul says, was surely right with God, but it was because of his trust in God. Hence the blessing to Abraham comes to those who follow Abraham’s trust and thus show themselves to be his heirs. Hence from the beginning the way was open for Gentiles to share in the blessing God gave to Abraham, because Gentiles can also share in Abraham’s trust in God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Indeed (3:10), those who seek to become Abraham’s heirs by relying on the law (i.e., their racial heritage) are under the curse that is invoked on anyone who does not live exclusively by the law (i.e., do all it commands). Yet even if one did live exclusively by the law (v. 11), one would still not be right with God, because God himself has said that only those who are right with God through trust will live. The law, on the other hand, does not foster the kind of trust that brings life, but rather condemns those who follow it to continue in a relation to law that leads to a curse. But that curse has been broken by Christ, who in his death has himself become the curse, and in dying has destroyed it (v. 13). Thus following Christ is now the way to emulate Abraham’s trust, which put him right with God. The promised blessing of Abraham, God’s very presence (the Spirit), comes to Gentiles through trust, not through circumcision/law/Jewish heritage.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul then illustrates his point on the primacy of trust over against the Jewish heritage (3:15–18). Playing on the fact that the Greek word <em class="calibre5">diath<span class="dcrit">ē</span>k<span class="dcrit">ē</span></em> means both “covenant” and “last will and testament,” Paul points out that no one tampers with a person’s will. Its bequests cannot be set aside by later decisions of the heirs. Now, the covenantal promise, the “bequest,” as it were, that was given to Abraham was given to him and to his “offspring.” Paul next uses a familiar Jewish method of interpretation. Note, he says, you who take the law so very seriously, that the word is singular: offspring, not offsprings. Therefore, it refers to a single heir and no more. And that heir is Christ. So if one is to inherit Abraham’s blessing, one will inherit it through Christ or one will not inherit it at all.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Note further, Paul says, that the law came 430 years after God ratified his covenant with Abraham; remember, he implies, that covenants cannot be set aside. <a id="pg367" class="calibre3"></a>Thus the law as a sign of the inheritance of Abraham’s blessing cannot annul trust in Christ as the sign of that blessing because the law came after the covenant of trust had already been made. God gave the inheritance as a promise; that promise is fulfilled in Christ. Therefore, Christ is the only way to inherit Abraham’s blessing. Nowhere, Paul argues, is the law said to be based on promise. Hence the law cannot be the way to inherit Abraham’s blessing. So Paul’s logic seems to run.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">“Christ Became a Curse for Us”</p>
<p class="sbaft">In Galatians 3:13, Paul quotes Deut 21:23: “anyone hung on a tree is under God’s curse.” The following quotation from the Dead Sea Scrolls (11QTemple 64.7–13) contains another interpretation of that text from about the same time.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">If a man slanders his people and delivers his people to a foreign nation and does evil to his people, you shall hang him on a tree and he shall die. On the testimony of two witnesses and on the testimony of three witnesses he shall be put to death and they shall hang him on the tree. If a man is guilty of a capital crime and flees (abroad) to the nations, and curses his people, the children of Israel, you shall hang him also on the tree, and he shall die. But his body shall not stay overnight on the tree. Indeed you shall bury him on the same day. For he who is hanged on the tree is accursed of God and men. You shall not pollute the ground which I give you to inherit. (Vermes)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Given all that, why was the law given at all (3:19–20)? — a logical question. The law was “added on” because of human trespass, until the true heir should appear. Paul adds material about angels and mediators that apparently would be clear to his original readers but that remains somewhat opaque for modern interpreters. It is probably intended to contrast the primary, immediate covenant God made with Abraham with the secondary (through angels) mediated (by Moses) covenant that brought the law. The point of the verses seems to be that because of human sin, some agency was needed to identify sin for what it was, however imperfect that agency may have been, until the true fulfillment of the promise, Christ, should appear. That imperfect agency was the law.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The next logical question is: are then law and promise in conflict (3:21–29)? If the law is not related to the righteousness promised through Abraham, does that mean that the law runs counter to God’s promised righteousness by offering <a id="pg368" class="calibre3"></a>another way to achieve righteousness? Of course not, Paul says, because there really is no righteousness possible under the law (for further discussion of this point see Rom 9:32–10:4). If God had established a law that could lead to life, then there would have been a righteousness based on “works of the law.” But that was not the purpose of the law. The law was not to be an alternative means of achieving righteousness; rather, as the law itself says (3:22), everything was included under sin, including the law, so that the promised righteousness should come only by faith in Christ (cf. Rom 11:32). Rather, the law kept people pointed to the righteousness to come in Christ so that, when it came, people could turn to it. But once the true fulfiller of the promise has come, the law has no further function. Before Christ, there was a true religious distinction between those who had the law (Jews) and those who did not. Since Christ came, all distinctions based on race, social class, and gender have been done away with (v. 28). Those who are in Christ are those who inherit the blessing promised to Abraham; to move away from Christ is thus to move away from, not into, the promise of God to Abraham.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Carrying through the Implications of Galatians 3:28</p>
<p class="sbo">It is worth noting that while Paul worked out the implications of the Jew-Gentile dichotomy in detail, he did not do so with the other two dichotomies, male-female and slave-free. Yet the thoroughness he displays in regard to the Jew-Gentile dichotomy shows what he intended with the other two: any religious distinction between the members of the dichotomy is voided in Christ. This is a warrant for Paul’s followers to carry out Paul’s self-announced program: to eliminate all barriers to full religious participation based on race, sex, or social status within the body of Christ.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Paul then turns (ch. 4) to a variety of arguments showing why it is futile to return to the old once one has embraced the new. The examples are drawn (1) from the Galatians’ Gentile past (vv. 1–11), (2) from Paul’s time with them (vv. 12–20), and (3) from the law (vv. 21–31). (1) For the Galatians to turn to the law will be to lose their deliverance in Christ from slavery to idols and therefore their status as children of God, a status evident when the Spirit present in their community allows them to address God as “Father.” (2) For the Galatians to turn to the law means that Paul’s work among them will have been in vain and that they will treat him not as the friend he has been but as an enemy. (3) To return to the law will be <a id="pg370" class="calibre3"></a>to enter into enslavement, pictured allegorically by Hagar and her son, rather than to retain freedom in Christ, pictured by Sarah and her son Isaac, the son born by God’s promise. Each of these examples is designed to show that by submitting to the demands of the “Preachers” the Galatian Christians have jeopardized their status as recipients of God’s grace, which comes only through Christ.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh"><a id="pg369" class="calibre6"></a>Unity in Christ</p>
<p class="sbaft">Paul’s statement at Galatians 3:28 that in Christ “there is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female” reverses sentiment found in Greek, Roman, and Jewish writings. The first-century biographer Plutarch wrote twenty-three pairs of parallel “lives” or brief biographies of famous individuals, designed to highlight certain virtues or vices. The following quotation, attributed to Plato, appears in Plutarch’s life of <em class="calibre5">Caius Marius</em> 46.1:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">Plato, however, when he was now at the point of death, lauded his guardian genius and Fortune because, to begin with, he had been born a man and not an irrational animal; again, because he was a Greek and not a Barbarian; and still again, because his birth had fallen in the times of Socrates.</p>
</div>
<p class="sbaft">Diogenes Laertius, an author of the early third century, wrote a compendium of the lives of the philosophers, which varies the similar comment found in Plutarch (<em class="calibre5">Lives of the Philosophers</em> 1.33):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">Hermippus in his <em class="calibre5">Lives</em> refers to Thales the story which is told by some of Socrates, namely, that he used to say there were three blessings for which he was grateful to Fortune: “First, that I was born a human being and not one of the brutes; next, that I was born a man and not a woman; thirdly, a Greek and not a barbarian.”</p>
</div>
<p class="sb">Finally, the following variation is found in the Babylonian Talmud (<em class="calibre5">Menahoth</em> 43b):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">It was taught: R. Judah used to say, A man is bound to say the following three blessings daily: “[Blessed art thou . . .] who hast not made me a heathen,” “. . . who hast not made me a woman,” and “. . . who hast not made me a brutish man.” R. Aha b. Jacob once overheard his son saying “[Blessed art thou . . .] who hast not made me a brutish man,” whereupon he said to him, “And this too!” Said the other, “Then what blessing should I say instead?” [He replied,] “. . . who has not made me a slave.” And is not that the same as a woman? — A slave is more contemptible.</p>
</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Signs of the Spirit’s Presence</p>
<p class="sbo">Paul affirms that there are two signs that the Spirit of God is present in a Christian community. The first, discussed in 1 Corinthians, is confession of Christ as Lord (12:3). The second sign, of great importance for Paul since he mentions it in two letters (Gal 4:6; Rom 8:15–16), is calling upon God as Father. Paul’s word in Rom 8:15, <em class="calibre5">abba,</em> the same word used by Jesus in Mark 14:36, was used by Jewish children to address their fathers. It implies both affection and respect: “my dear father.” Where those two elements are present — confessing Christ as Lord and calling upon God as Father — it is proof that the Spirit of God is also present. Where one or the other is absent, it is doubtful that Paul would say the Spirit of God was present there.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">The sum of Paul’s argument is then drawn up (ch. 5). To return to the law is to forfeit the freedom gained in Christ. Christ and law is not a both/and matter; one does not gain additional standing with God by becoming a Jew (i.e., by taking on the law and becoming circumcised), as the “Preachers” have apparently argued. Rather, one forfeits all standing with God through such a procedure. There is no such thing as part law, part Christ; one relies wholly on the one or wholly on the other. To be under law means to be separated from Christ; the opposite is also true. Thus circumcision is of no help. Here Paul has to deny that he requires circumcision (5:11); apparently the opponents have tried to justify their demand with that spurious claim as well.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Christians are free from the normal separation of humanity into conflicting groups (3:28), but this does not mean they are free for undisciplined acts (5:13). The key point about Christian freedom is that it is freedom to serve others, not to indulge oneself. Such self-indulgence Paul outlines in 5:19–21; those who engage in such practices will not inherit God’s kingdom. Rather, freedom requires the kind of self-discipline outlined in v. 22.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In fact, to heed the God-given Spirit, which leads to such acts of disciplined <a id="pg371" class="calibre3"></a>love rather than to surrender to sin-tainted flesh, fulfills what the law actually intends. One need not be circumcised to do that, only be true to Christ (5:23b). In fact, only Christians fulfill God’s law, because they are not under the curse, whereas the Jews who do not follow Christ cannot fulfill the law, because they are under that curse.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter ends with some advice to the Galatian Christians on how to conduct themselves in accordance with their faith (6:1–10) and closes with a paragraph written in Paul’s own hand. In the latter, Paul questions the motives of those advocating circumcision: they want to avoid persecution (from Jews in Jerusalem? from strict Jewish Christians?); they want to gain an advantage (for their party?) by requiring something that they themselves do not do, namely keep the law. The central point, however, is Christ crucified, who by renewing creation makes moot any question of circumcision or uncircumcision (v. 15). It is that new creation that is the true Israel (the “Israel of God,” v. 16).</p>
<p class="calibre8">So Paul’s argument runs in Galatians, which is at its core an argument for the all-sufficiency of the grace promised to Abraham and realized in the crucified and risen Christ. It is a grace that, because of its completeness, makes unnecessary any and all other means of assuring favor from God.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">The Letter of Freedom</p>
<p class="sbaft">Galatians is a letter of freedom in a twofold way: it represents not only freedom from, but also freedom for. It speaks of freedom from</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="sbulf">• dependence on creation, which is idolatry,</p>
<p class="sbulf">• dependence on law, which is immaturity/sin, and</p>
<p class="sbulf">• dependence on self, which is slavery to “flesh” (i.e., a life without God at its center).</p>
</div>
<p class="sbaft">It also speaks of freedom for</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="sbulf">• faith/trust, as heirs with Christ,</p>
<p class="sbulf">• blessing, as children of Abraham, and</p>
<p class="sbulf">• life, as those who receive God’s Spirit.</p>

</div>
<p class="ah" id="ch14ah02"><a id="pg372" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch14ah02" class="calibre6">14.2. SOME PROBLEMS</a></p>
<p class="pf">The major literary problems surrounding this letter have to do with the recipients, and therefore the time when it was written. Scholars have raised no serious objections to Paul as author; the letter is almost universally accepted as coming from him. Nor is there any real question about the integrity of the text. Apart from the usual kinds of variations caused by hand copying, the text we have is in all essentials the text as it emerged from the mind, and with respect to the final paragraph, from the hand, of the apostle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What is in dispute is where we are to locate the “churches of Galatia” to whom the letter is addressed. It is apparent that the addressees belong to a Christian community founded by Paul (4:13, 19), who first visited them because of a “bodily ailment” (4:13) evidently affecting his eyes (4:15). Apparently he had been forced to stop there because of this infirmity even though he had not planned to do so. Where then are these churches to be found?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Galatia may refer to two areas, the ethnic Galatian area in central Asia Minor with its chief city Ancyra (modern Ankara), or the Roman province of that name, which included the lands of Lycaonia and Pisidia to the south and the cities of Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. The ethnic area was dominated from the third to the first centuries <small class="calibre9">B.C.E.</small> by invading Celtic tribes from Gaul — hence the name “Galatia.” These tribes had the reputation of being wild and uncivilized. In 25 <small class="calibre9">B.C.E.</small>, under Augustus, ethnic Galatia became a Roman province when King Amyntas of Galatia was killed preserving his territory in the Taurus mountains and his sons were prevented from inheriting his domain. Does the “Galatia” that Paul mentions therefore refer to the more northern ethnic area in central Asia Minor, or to the Roman province, which included lands to the south of the original ethnic enclave?</p>
<p class="calibre8">When Acts refers to the mission of Paul in central Asia Minor (16:6; 18:23), both Galatia and Phrygia are mentioned, thus pointing to the ethnic area, since there was no Roman province of “Phrygia.” On that basis, the Galatia mentioned in Paul’s letter would refer to the ethnic area in central Asia Minor (the “north Galatian theory”). On the other hand, some scholars have argued that Paul regularly uses names of Roman provinces when he identifies areas in his letters (e.g., Macedonia and Achaia, Rom 15:26), so that his reference to the province of Galatia here would include the cities in the southern portion of the province (the “south Galatian theory”). Much ink has been spilled in this controversy, since there is no definitive evidence one way or the other. It is not clear, for example, that Paul regularly uses the names of Roman provinces when he refers to areas. It seems likely, for example, that he means the areas rather than the provinces when he refers to Judea (2 Cor 1:16) and Syria (Gal 1:21).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Again, it is clear from the letter that the people addressed are Gentiles — <a id="pg374" class="calibre3"></a>they were idolaters before their conversion to the Christian faith (4:8) and had not been circumcised (5:2; 6:12) — yet according to Acts, Paul dealt with Jews in Pisidia and Lycaonia (Acts 13:14–15; 14:1; 16:3). Furthermore, the communities Paul was addressing were all undergoing the same difficulties, something hard to imagine if the area addressed includes the whole of the province of Galatia. Further, it would be unlikely that Paul would address his readers as “Galatians” (3:1) if they resided only in the southern area of the province, which had belonged to other ethnic groups before they were included in the Roman province of Galatia. All this points to “Galatia” as referring to the ethnic area (the “north Galatian theory”).</p>

</tbody></table>
<p class="calibre8">The decision about the area to which Paul’s letter was addressed also has an influence on one’s decision about when the letter is to be dated. If Paul is referring to the Roman province, including the southern area, then one may date the letter early if one follows Acts, since Paul had evangelized the southern cities during his first missionary journey. On the other hand, if Paul is referring to ethnic Galatia, it is an area he did not visit until his second missionary journey according to Acts, and hence the letter must be dated somewhat later. Yet we have already seen that Acts is not a complete account of Paul’s missionary travels, and many scholars are reluctant to assume chronological exactness with respect to the material in Acts. Finally, and most importantly, the date when Paul wrote the letter and even the people to whom he wrote it are not of any real significance in understanding the <a id="pg375" class="calibre3"></a>problem Paul is addressing and the points he wants to make in this letter to the “churches in Galatia.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">This discussion is an indication of the kind of problems that are often associated with the letters of Paul but that finally do not really influence our understanding of the letters. We may learn a good deal from this letter about Paul’s understanding of the Christian faith even though we remain uncertain about to whom and when Paul wrote it.</p>
