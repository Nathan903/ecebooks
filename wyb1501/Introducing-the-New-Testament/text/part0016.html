<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch12" class="calibre6">Paul’s Letter to the Christians in Rome</a></p>
<p class="pf">Romans is the longest of the letters of Paul that have been preserved for us, and for that reason also it stands as the first of those letters included in the NT. It is also the most carefully worked-out statement of the way Paul understood the Christian faith.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When he wrote the letter, Paul had never visited Rome, despite his repeated intention to do so (1:11, 13; see also 15:22–23). He was therefore unknown in person to many of the Christians there, though they had surely been informed about him by the many acquaintances there that Paul greets in Romans 16. Yet misunderstandings about Paul’s view of the Christian faith were apparently also circulating (e.g., 3:8b), and it would thus be useful for the Romans to have from Paul a firsthand account of the Christian faith he proclaimed to the Gentile world. Perhaps that is also the reason Paul uncharacteristically names no companions or co-senders in this letter; it is evidently intended to be an undiluted account of his own understanding of the gospel.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch12ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch12ah01" class="calibre6">12.1. THE PURPOSE OF THE LETTER</a></p>
<p class="pf">It is evident that when Paul wrote this letter, a mature Christian community already existed in Rome. Paul acknowledges the fame of their faith “in all the world” (1:8) and expects that they will strengthen his faith as he will strengthen theirs (1:12). The tradition that Paul co-founded the church there (with Peter) can thus not be maintained. As the apostle to the Gentiles, Paul nevertheless feels an obligation to visit the Christians in Rome and to inform them of his understanding of the Christian faith (1:15). He also has in mind as he writes this letter the <a id="pg300" class="calibre3"></a>continuation of his mission to the western half of the Mediterranean world, namely, Spain (15:24). From the language he uses, we may infer, as his readers would have, that he hoped to find support for that mission from the Roman church. We know that Paul received such support from the Christian community in Philippi (Phil 4:14–16), and that may have been the case with some other churches as well. Be that as it may, it is clear that one of the purposes for which Paul wrote this letter was to enlist the help of the Roman Christians for his mission to the western parts of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p class="calibre8">He must suffer one more delay (15:22) before he can come to visit them, however (15:25), a delay to be caused by his projected journey to Jerusalem to complete his promised provision for the poor among the Christians there that he promised to undertake when he met with the disciples in Jerusalem some years previously (Gal 2:10). Paul attached considerable importance to this gift, which he apparently understood in a reciprocal sense — that is, as Jerusalem shared its spiritual wealth — the gospel — with the Gentiles, so in response the Gentiles would share their material wealth with Jerusalem (15:27). That this was more than just a gift for the poor is indicated by Paul’s request to his readers that they join him in prayer to God that his gift may be “acceptable to the saints,” that is, to the Christians in Jerusalem. But why would there be some question about their accepting a <a id="pg301" class="calibre3"></a>gift they had requested (Gal 2:10a)? The likely answer is that because the gift was associated with the legitimation of Paul’s mission to the Gentiles by the disciples in Jerusalem (Gal 2:7–9), its acceptance by those same Jerusalem authorities would be further acknowledgment of the validity of Paul’s Gentile mission, a validity Paul’s dispute with Peter and Barnabas (Gal 2:11–12) and implicitly with the church in Jerusalem headed by James (Gal 2:12) may have called into question. Unless the Gentile mission of Paul were acknowledged by the Jerusalem authorities as legitimate, however, the church would be split into two halves, Jewish and Gentile, and then any mission of Paul to the Gentiles in Spain would only further exacerbate the split in the church as the body of Christ. What was at issue, therefore, in Paul’s trip to Jerusalem was nothing less than the unity of the church and hence the legitimacy of the gospel that announced the unity of all people in Jesus Christ (Gal 3:28).</p>

<p class="figh">The Forum in Rome</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">A further danger Paul anticipated with respect to his journey to Jerusalem is evident from his request to his readers that they pray for his deliverance from the “unbelievers in Judea” (15:31a), probably Jews who opposed the Christian faith as Paul himself had. We hear nothing further in the NT about the journey to Spain; Acts makes no reference to it, either as planned or completed, nor is there any additional reference to it in any of Paul’s letters. That probably means that Paul was in fact arrested when he went to Jerusalem, and thus his missionary career was brought to an end. Romans may therefore be the last letter we have from the apostle Paul.</p>
<p class="calibre8">An additional purpose for the letter is to present the Roman Christians with a “reminder,” apparently of some central points Paul felt it was his mission to emphasize (15:15). It appears from the way he phrases this statement that he does not presume to instruct the Roman Christians in aspects of the faith of which they are ignorant, but rather that he intends to emphasize some points he thinks are central to their faith. That probably also means that Paul has included traditions in his letter that he assumes are known to the Roman Christians since they were generally in circulation among other churches as well. Fragments of such traditions may be contained, for example, in 1:2–4; 3:25–26; or 4:25, as well as in other places. It may also mean that he includes some generalized instruction on problems that his experience has taught him are widespread among Christian churches, such as the problem of diet and the relationship between the weak and the strong (chs. 14–15; more on this below).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul’s stated reasons for writing this letter therefore include his desire to introduce himself to the Roman Christians in anticipation of his visit there, his desire that they pray for his safe deliverance from his enemies in Jerusalem and the acceptance of his gift by the Jerusalem Christian authorities, his hope for support for his subsequent mission to Spain, and his intention to remind them of some central tenets of the Christian faith that belong to his understanding of the gospel.</p>

<p class="fig"><a id="pg302" class="calibre3"></a><img src="../images/00050.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre62"/></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">An unstated purpose often espoused by current scholars is Paul’s desire to bring reconciliation between feuding factions of Jewish and Gentile Christians in the Roman church. The situation assumed is that the letter was written after Jews (including Jewish Christians), who had been expelled by Emperor Claudius (see Acts 18:2) around 49, had returned to Rome after the emperor’s death in 54, only to find that the church in Rome had in the meantime been taken over by Gentile Christians. Those Gentile Christians displayed an attitude of superiority over the returning Jewish Christians, in part at least because the latter belonged to a race that had, by and large, rejected Christ, a rejection by which God had specifically created room for Gentile believers (11:19). The returning Jewish Christians, who probably at least shared in leadership roles in the Roman Christian community prior to their expulsion, for their part questioned the legitimacy of a Christianity that ignored the Jewish law and seemed to think indifference to its food regulations was a proper attitude for the followers of Jesus Christ. It was this situation <a id="pg303" class="calibre3"></a>that threatened to split the Christian community in Rome and that therefore served as the primary occasion for Paul’s letter. Paul thus addressed both the (“weak”) Jewish and the (“strong”) Gentile Christians (chs. 14–15) in an attempt to overcome Gentile arrogance toward the Jewish Christians and to allay Jewish suspicions about the shape of Paul’s gospel by discussing the important role Israel played in God’s salvific plan, even though the culmination of that plan, Jesus Christ, was more widely accepted by Gentiles than by Jews (3:1–8; chs. 4; 9–11).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Despite the wide popularity of this explanation for the purpose of Paul’s letter to the Roman Christians, there are a number of assumptions embodied in it that will not stand careful examination. For example, the assumption that Claudius expelled all the Jews (and therefore Jewish Christians) from Rome is based on three witnesses — Acts 18:2, the Roman second-century-<small class="calibre9">C.E.</small> historian Suetonius, and a fifth-century Christian writer named Orosius. The first two mention only Jews as expelled; Orosius is not sure whether Jewish Christians also were expelled. Orosius is the only one who mentions that the expulsion took place in 49. He cites a passage in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus as the source of his information, a passage that in fact does not exist.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbf">In his account of the reign of Emperor Claudius in <em class="calibre5">Lives of the Caesars</em> (5.25.4), the Roman author Suetonius records this much discussed event:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">“Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">On the other hand, that all Jews were expelled by Claudius is specifically denied by another Roman historian, Cassius Dio, who says Claudius could not expel them all because of the tumult it would have caused. Rather, he says, Claudius forbade their meeting together, although continuing to permit their traditional way of life. This calls into question the departure of all Jews from the city, as does the fact that such imperial decrees were not always obeyed. For example, several attempts to ban all astrologers from Rome were made, in each case without signal success. That prominent Jewish Christians could be affected, if such a ban were in fact decreed, is likely, as in the case of Priscilla and Aquila, wealthy Jewish Christians who had owned homes in several cities (1 Cor 16:19; Rom 16:5; Acts 18:3), but to assume that every Jew, slave or free, left Rome because of the decree seems unlikely.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh"><a id="pg304" class="calibre6"></a>Cosmopolitan Rome</p>
<p class="sbaft">Hence, from now on let the reader forever renounce the views of those who make Rome a retreat of barbarians, fugitives and vagabonds, and let him confidently affirm it to be a Greek city, which will be easy when he shows that it is at once the most hospitable and friendly of all cities, and when he bears in mind that the Aborigines were Oenotrians, and these in turn Arcadians, and remembers those who joined with them in their settlement, the Pelasgians who were Argives by descent and came into Italy from Thessaly; and recalls, moreover, the arrival of Evander and of the Arcadians, who settled round the Palatine hill, after the Aborigines had granted the place to them; and also the Peloponnesians, who, coming along with Hercules, settled upon the Saturnian hill; and, last of all, those who left the Troad and were intermixed with the earlier settlers. For one will find no nation that is more ancient or more Greek than these. But the admixtures of the barbarians with the Romans, by which the city forgot many of its ancient institutions, happened at a later time. And it may well seem a cause of wonder to many who reflect on the natural course of events that Rome did not become entirely barbarized after receiving the Opicans, the Marsians, the Samnites, the Tyrrhenians, the Bruttians and many thousands of Umbrians, Ligurians, Iberians and Gauls, besides innumerable other nations, some of whom came from Italy itself and some from other regions and differed from one another both in their language and habits; for their very ways of life, diverse as they were and thrown into turmoil by such dissonance, might have been expected to cause many innovations in the ancient order of the city. For many others by living among barbarians have in a short time forgotten all their Greek heritage, so that they neither speak the Greek language nor observe the customs of the Greeks nor acknowledge the same gods nor have the same equitable laws (by which most of all the spirit of the Greeks differs from that of the barbarians) nor agree with them in anything else whatever that relates to the ordinary intercourse of life. Those Achaeans who are settled near the Euxine sea are a sufficient proof of my contention; for, though originally Eleans, of a nation the most Greek of any, they are now the most savage of all barbarians.</p>
<p class="sbl">The language spoken by the Romans is neither utterly barbarous nor absolutely Greek, but a mixture, as it were, of both, the greater part of which is Aeolic; and the only disadvantage they have experienced from their intermingling with these various nations is that they do not pronounce all the sounds properly. But all other indications of a Greek origin they preserve beyond any other colonists. For it is not merely recently, since they have enjoyed the full tide of good fortune to instruct them in the amenities of life, that they have begun to live humanely; nor is it merely since they first aimed at the conquest of countries lying beyond the sea, after overthrowing the Carthaginian and Macedonian empires, but rather from the time when they first joined in founding the city, that they have lived like Greeks; and they do not attempt anything more illustrious in the pursuit of virtue now than formerly. (Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <em class="calibre5">Roman Antiquities</em> I.89.1–90.1)</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg305" class="calibre3"></a>Again, the assumption that Paul is addressing both Jewish and Gentile Christians to heal the division between them is nowhere made explicit, or even stated, in the letter. The only people Paul specifically says he is addressing are Gentiles (1:5–6, 13). In 1:14 he says that his obligation to go to Rome concerns both Greeks and barbarians, both categories of Gentiles. Had Paul in fact also been addressing Jews, one would have expected some similarly explicit reference to that fact.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Furthermore, he nowhere gives his desire to heal such a division as a reason for the letter. When divisions were a problem, as in Corinth, Paul addressed the problem directly (1 Cor 1:10). Similarly, when he discusses the church as the body of Christ in 1 Corinthians 12, he again refers to problems of division (12:14–26), something totally absent from a similar discussion in Rom 12:4–11. Nor can one say that in Romans 14–15, with its discussion of weak and strong Christians, the “weak” are necessarily Jews and the “strong” necessarily Gentiles. Paul, himself a Jew, surely belongs to the “strong,” as would Priscilla and Aquila, Jews closely associated with Paul. Nor may one assume that all Gentile Christians would automatically eat meat (Rom 14:2), given the association of banquets with Roman cults and the sale in the marketplace of meat sacrificed to pagan gods. A former devotee of a pagan cult or god might well feel it necessary to avoid meat associated with their former life, a problem specifically discussed in 1 Cor 8:4–13, where the “weak” are clearly Gentile Christians. Thus, it is not clear whether Romans 14–15 is intended to address a specific problem in Rome or is a kind of generalized advice, similar to that in 1 Corinthians 8–9, that Paul has included along with similar general advice in Romans 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Finally, Paul’s lengthy discussions of the place of Israel in God’s plan of salvation owe more to his understanding that the “divine gospel” he was called to preach was rooted in Israel (Rom 1:2–4) than to a supposed desire to convince Gentiles in Rome that they ought not be arrogant toward Jews. Paul’s discussions of Israel in Romans in each instance have to do with the substance of his understanding of the gospel; his discussion is thus not simply occasioned by a supposed conflict between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome.</p>
<p class="calibre8">That does not mean there were no Jewish Christians in the Roman Christian communities when Paul wrote; the Jewish names among those he greets in ch. 16 demonstrate that there were. Why Paul explicitly addresses only Gentile Christians is due not to any absence, or lesser importance, of Jewish Christians but to Paul’s scrupulous abiding by the agreement he reached with the Jerusalem authorities (Gal 2:7–9) that he was to be the apostle to the Gentiles, lest he be accused of violating that apostolic compact.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch12ah02"><a id="pg306" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch12ah02" class="calibre6">12.2. WHERE THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN</a></p>
<p class="pf">If Paul does tell us why he wrote the letter, he does not tell us where he was when he composed it. If in speaking of the collection for Jerusalem he mentions the southern half of the Greek Peninsula last (Achaia — Rom 15:26; Macedonia is the northern half of the peninsula) because he is there, then he was very probably writing in Corinth, where Achaia’s most important church was. That the woman who carried the letter to Rome, Phoebe, was a deacon in the church at Cenchreae, a harbor town some seven miles east of Corinth (16:1), would seem to add confirmation. Again, if the Gaius who is Paul’s host (16:23) is the Gaius whom Paul baptized in Corinth (1 Cor 1:14), then that is yet further evidence Paul is in Corinth. But Gaius was an extremely common name in the Greco-Roman world (for another Gaius, see Acts 20:4). Erastus, mentioned in Rom 16:23 as the city treasurer, may also have been an official in Corinth; an Erastus is mentioned in 2 Tim 4:20 as one who remained in Corinth. An Erastus is identified as a helper of Paul along with Timothy in Acts 19:22. Whether these represent the same person is also difficult to determine; one must wonder if an important city official would have traveled as much as the Erastus of 2 Timothy and Acts apparently did.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Although there can be no certainty in the matter, the most likely point of origin for the letter appears to have been Corinth, where Paul completed the collection and from which he set out for Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch12ah03"><a href="part0002.html#rch12ah03" class="calibre6">12.3. THE LETTER’S AUTHOR AND INTEGRITY</a></p>
<p class="pf">That Paul himself was the author of Romans has never been seriously questioned. Some have questioned whether ch. 16 belonged to the original letter, since it seems strange, they argue, that Paul would have known so many people in a city he had never visited. Yet mobility in the empire in the middle of the first century was great, and many were migrating to Rome during this period. It would also have been important for Paul to name as many people as he could who knew him and could vouch for the authenticity and reliability of his gospel. The extent to which women played key roles in the early church is also evident in this chapter, where, in addition to Phoebe, the deacon who carried the letter to Rome, Paul sends greetings to Prisca (v. 3), Mary (v. 6), Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis (v. 12), the mother of Rufus (v. 13), Julia (v. 15), and the sister of Nereus (v. 15). Depending on the textual tradition (in some early texts the name is given in its masculine form, in others in its feminine form), this list would also include Junia (v. 7). The language used to describe these women indicates that a number of them were active in Christian mission.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In addition to questions about ch. 16, some scholars have from time to time <a id="pg307" class="calibre3"></a>proposed that other passages were added to Romans by copyists, but there is no agreement on such additions. There is a textual problem concerning the location of the benediction in 16:25–27, however. Ancient manuscripts place it at the end of ch. 14, at the end of ch. 15, at the end of ch. 16, at the end of both chs. 14 and 15, or at the end of both chs. 14 and 16, or omit it altogether. Some scholars have concluded that this may indicate that the letter originally ended with ch. 14, or perhaps with ch. 15, but the textual evidence will not allow us to come to any firm conclusions. The thrust of Paul’s argument in Romans is not affected by the position of this benediction, so it is a problem we may confess to being unable to resolve without prejudicing our understanding of what Paul has said in the letter.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch12ah04"><a href="part0002.html#rch12ah04" class="calibre6">12.4. THE THEME OF THE LETTER</a></p>
<p class="pf">There is a long tradition, reaching all the way back to the Reformation in the sixteenth century, that the theme of Romans, as of Paul’s theology in general, is that people are made righteous before God by faith (or “trust”) rather than by works of the law. Because this point is made explicitly in Rom 1:17, that verse has been understood to be the statement of the theme. The remainder of the letter is then the attempt to work out the implications of that theme for Christian faith (chs. 1–8) and practice (chs. 12–15). Yet such an understanding of Romans has had difficulty accounting for the location and content of chs. 9–11, which have consistently, therefore, represented a problem for such an understanding of Romans. Nor is it clear why, after Paul has affirmed that justification by faith has taken place (5:1), he needed to say anything further; he could apparently have turned at that point to showing what justification meant for the way Christians are to live. Such problems indicate that the theme of Romans is probably not to be found in 1:17, important as that verse is for Paul’s understanding of God’s way of dealing with sinful human beings.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A more appropriate locus for the statement of a theme would be at the beginning of the letter, and in fact that seems to be the case here as well. Surely the content of Paul’s ministry, as he himself says at the outset, is the “gospel of God” (1:1), a gospel then defined in 1:2–4. These verses summarize how God has carried out his redemptive plan in the history of the Jews (the prophets, David, vv. 2–3) and in the decisive act of Christ’s resurrection (v. 4). This summary leads seamlessly into Paul’s declaration of his own call to evangelize the Gentiles (v. 5) as a direct outgrowth of these salvific acts of God. The universality of the gospel’s significance, implied by the references to elements of Jewish history and to Paul’s call to preach to Gentiles (vv. 2–5), is then in fact made thematic beginning with vv. 14–16, where the universal significance is expressed in terms of two inclusive contrasts: Greek and barbarian (v. 14), Jew and Greek (v. 16). These two passages, 1:2–5 and <a id="pg308" class="calibre3"></a>1:14–16, indicate together that the universal availability of divine salvation, understood in terms of its history in God’s activity with the Jews, is the theme of the letter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In 11:32, at the end of the development of his argument in chs. 1–11, Paul again refers to the same theme, declaring explicitly the universality of purpose contained in the divine plan of salvation: God has enclosed <em class="calibre5">all</em> people in disobedience, in order to have mercy on <em class="calibre5">all.</em> The striking similarity of the statement in Gal 3:22, again in the context of the universal scope of the Christian faith (3:28), indicates that such phrasing may have been a regular part of the way Paul described the universality of the range and application of the gospel. The summary statement in Rom 11:32 leads, then, into Paul’s hymnic celebration of how God has acted for human salvation (11:33–36), before he turns in chs. 12–15 to how this understanding of the gospel affects how Christians are to live.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thus the universal significance of the gospel is announced, an announcement that lies closer to the general content and organization of the letter than the concept of being made right with God through trust. This is not to say that being made right with God through trust in what he has done in Jesus Christ is unimportant for Paul. Such “righteousness through trust” is, however, not the theme of Romans. It is, rather, a statement of the means by which the gospel of God’s mercy is made available to Gentiles as well as Jews.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The familiar phrase “justification by faith” can convey some nuances that Paul did not intend. “Justification” in modern English has legal overtones, and justification is often understood as God as judge freeing human sinners from the punishment due their sins. But Paul took this term from the covenant language of Israel, where it describes being in a right covenantal relationship with God. To be made righteous therefore means, for Paul, to leave a rebellious relationship in which one opposes what God wants and to enter into a positive relationship in which one seeks to follow God’s will. This is the “new covenant” about which Paul speaks and which was inaugurated by Christ’s death and resurrection. One enters that new relationship with God by accepting what God has done for sinners in Christ. Such acceptance is what Paul calls “faith.” Again, a better choice of word would be “trust.” “Faith” in modern English often means assent to the validity of some intellectual content. But Paul uses that word not to get his readers to assent to the existence of God and Christ, but to place their trust in God and Christ to fulfill what they have promised. In that way, human beings leave their rebellious ways, which have separated them from God, that is, their sin, and now enter a positive relationship through Christ in which they seek to act in accordance with the divine will for human beings as displayed in Christ. For that reason, we use the phrase “righteousness through trust” rather than “justification by faith.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is, Paul is affirming, no longer a matter of being born into the chosen people, the Jews, but rather of trusting what God has done for all people in Christ. Righteousness by trust is thus the way that God’s saving grace is made available to <a id="pg309" class="calibre3"></a>all people. This is shown by the fact that 1:17, with its statement about getting right with God through trust, serves to clarify the announcement in v. 16b that God’s saving righteousness is now open to everyone, Jew (first) and Greek — that is, that it is universal in scope. That the history of God’s dealing with humanity through his chosen people, the Jews, underlies even that universal expression of God’s mercy is shown by its being framed in terms of “righteousness,” a concept almost surely borrowed from the covenant language of Israel. It is, furthermore, precisely this announced universal significance of the gospel that makes the discussion in chs. 9–11 essential, and gives poignancy to it. There that universal significance appears violated by the Jews’ self-exclusion, rather than by the exclusion of the Gentiles, as was the case before Christ’s coming. Thus the means by which God’s plan of salvation proceeds, namely, through God’s covenant with sinful and rebellious humanity, a point Paul will make in his ensuing discussion, is announced in 1:17, clearly supporting the universal applicability of the gospel, which was announced in 1:14–16. Obviously, getting right with God through trust is an important point for Paul, but it is important as the means by which the universal scope of the gospel is carried out, rather than as the theme of the letter.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch12ah05"><a href="part0002.html#rch12ah05" class="calibre6">12.5. THE CONTENT OF THE LETTER</a></p>
<p class="pf">Paul follows the usual form of the Hellenistic letter, with the kind of adaptations he frequently made. The letter opening (1:1–7) contains the usual elements of the Hellenistic form, but they are lengthened considerably, particularly Paul’s self-identification, which includes a summary of the gospel he proclaimed (1:2–6). As usual, he concludes the opening with a wish for divine grace and peace for his readers (1:7). The thanksgiving, again a usual part of a Hellenistic letter, flows into the letter body to such an extent that it is difficult to say exactly where the one ends and the other begins. Scholars usually define the thanksgiving as comprising 1:8–10, with the letter body beginning with 1:11, even though, as its grammar shows, v. 11 is intended to flow as an integral part of the discussion in v. 10.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The letter body comprises 1:11–15:13 and can itself be divided in a number of ways. It is typical to find two main segments of the letter body: the first (1:11–11:36) is a lengthy exposition of various facets of Paul’s theme of the universal availability of God’s mercy to all people, Jew and Gentile alike. A shorter second section (12:1–15:13) deals with the implications such mercy entails for living together in the Christian community which now includes both Jew and Gentile. We shall find reason, as our discussion proceeds, to divide the first segment into three parts: one dealing with the past (1:11–4:22), one with the present (4:23–8:39), and one with problems related to the future (9:1–11:36). The letter closing, again long by Hellenistic standards (15:14–16:27), is comprised of an account of Paul’s travel <a id="pg310" class="calibre3"></a>plans, closing with a blessing (15:14–33), commendation of Phoebe and greetings to Christians in Rome (16:1–23), which includes a final exhortation (16:17–20) and a concluding doxology (16:25–27).</p>

<p class="calibre8">Paul begins his discussion by announcing that apart from Christ, all of humanity has rebelled against God by turning away from him as the creator of the universe and turning instead to some created entity to which ultimate allegiance is given. Because there was enough evidence in creation itself to warn people away from this act of setting something other than God at the center of their lives (1:19–20), such rebellion against God is culpable (1:21) and brings wrath (1:18, 24–31). Paul understands this substitution of creature for creator as idolatry (1:22–23, 25). It brings in its train the breakdown of human society, including a perversion that extends from the normal relationship between the sexes (1:24–27) to the normal social relationships among individuals (1:28–32). The punishment for such perversion of creation, such idolatry, is the continuation of such perversion; God’s punishment is to “give them over” to such activity (1:24, 26, 28). The punishment of sin is to allow sin to continue. People cannot excuse themselves from such activity by condemning others for what they themselves also do (2:1); God judges on the basis of reality, not appearances (2:6, 11). Neither a natural sense of morality in human beings (2:14–15) nor the possession by the Jews of God’s covenantal law (2:17–24) can excuse such conduct, since God looks not at outward appearance but at inward reality (2:25–29). That does not mean God has abandoned his covenant with his chosen people, the Jews, even though they have abandoned God <a id="pg311" class="calibre3"></a>through their rejection of Christ (3:1–8), but it does mean that the covenant will not protect them from God’s judgment of their rebellious conduct. As a result, Paul concludes, all human beings, Jews and Gentiles, stand in rebellion against God and hence under the power of sin; being a member of the chosen people does not mean such sin will be overlooked (3:9–20).</p>
<p class="calibre8">This is not the final fate of human beings, however, because in Christ, God acted in a decisive way to remain faithful to his sinful creation, but in a way different from the establishment of his covenant with the Jews as his chosen people. To be sure, that covenant, with its law and prophets, pointed to this decisive act of God’s faithfulness to his rebellious creation, but members of that covenant are now also included in this new way to be right with God, namely, through trust in <a id="pg312" class="calibre3"></a>what God has done in Jesus Christ. The cross of Christ, a sacrifice that established the new covenant, must lead to trust in God who in that way put aside human sin (3:21–25). This shows that God, in remaining faithful to his creation (“righteous”), allows his creatures to become faithful to him (“righteous”) by trusting in what he has done in Christ (3:26).</p>

<p class="sbh">Idolatry and Immorality</p>
<p class="sbaft">The link between idolatry and immorality was current in Jewish literature, as Wisdom of Solomon 14:21–27 demonstrates:</p>
<div class="senseline">

<p class="calibre8">What all that means is that confidence in one’s relationship to God can now <a id="pg313" class="calibre3"></a>only be based on one’s trust in Christ, not in one’s membership in the chosen people. Membership in the chosen people was to be expressed through “works of the law,” works done in obedience to the law. These works included, but were by no means limited to, “works” such as circumcision and the keeping of regulations regarding food and purity that marked Israel off from the nations and so pointed to its unique status. That is to say, Paul here means by the phrase “works of the law” <a id="pg314" class="calibre3"></a>not a general attempt by human beings to earn favor with God through their good conduct. Rather, as 3:28–29 shows, with “works of the law” Paul has in mind the obedience of the Jews to the law. Paul thought only Jews could do “works of the law,” since they alone had been given that law by God (so 3:1). Paul will use “works” and “works of the law” in that sense throughout Romans. It is another way of referring to salvation through membership in the chosen people, something Paul insists is not possible (3:30).</p>
<p class="calibre8">God has not changed his mind in asking for trust from his creatures. That was the intent of the law all along (3:30)! This is shown in the story of Abraham, whose trust in God put him into a positive relationship with God long before the law was given (4:1–12). That is also true for the descendants of Abraham, to whom the promise of inheriting the world was given. Because a promise requires trust that it be fulfilled, any confidence based on anything else — including membership in a chosen people to whom God’s law was given and so who were obligated to carry out works in obedience to the law — destroys confidence based on trust (4:14–21). The story of Abraham shows, therefore, that from the beginning, God intended that human beings base their relationship with God on trust that he will keep his promises. Thus the true descendants of Abraham are those who share not his gene pool but his trust in God (4:9–13), which allowed him to stand in a positive relationship with God (4:22).</p>
<p class="calibre8">What Paul has described thus far for his readers has all occurred in the past. But its significance is not limited to the past. It also has relevance for the present (4:23–24a, already hinted at in 3:21). At this point in his letter, therefore, Paul turns from a discussion of the past to a discussion of the present. Since Paul’s readers are now in a positive relationship with God through their trust in Christ (5:1) as a result of the new opportunity for the forgiveness of sin and a rectified relationship to God offered in Christ (4:24–25), what does that mean for their present life?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul turns immediately to the problem of suffering, which was apparently so widespread among Christians that Paul simply assumes its presence. The difference is that for the Christian, suffering can have a positive outcome because it can engender hope, a hope based on what God has done for the Christian in Christ (5:2–5). Paul then explains, as a way of providing implicitly the basis for any Christian hope, what it is that God has done. Such hope, he implies, is based on the fact that before a sinner could do anything to get back into a positive relationship with God, God had already done the decisive thing to that end through the divine act in Christ. God’s love was such that he demonstrated his faithfulness to his fallen creatures before they had any chance to respond (5:6–8). As we shall see, this is the basis for Paul’s assertion that sinners are saved by grace alone.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If Christ’s death has placed the sinner in a new relationship with God (5:9a, 10a), Christ’s resurrection gives that sinner hope for a new life in the age to come (5:9b, 10b). It is important to note here that for Paul, salvation belongs to the <a id="pg315" class="calibre3"></a>future. Those who trust in Christ are now set in a positive relationship with God (“made righteous,” “reconciled”), but they will not be “saved” until the final judgment (5:9b), at which time they will share Christ’s resurrection (5:10b; Paul will have more to say about this in ch. 6). Salvation for Paul is an eschatological concept; that is, it belongs to the end times, when Christ will return and judge all humanity. The Christian can hope for such salvation in the present, but will not experience it until some point in the future, when Christ returns. The upshot of this is that Christians can face such suffering as may come their way with joy because of their present reconciliation with God through Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul turns next to the question why such reconciliation (5:11) was necessary. He discusses it in terms of the two figures that represent the two ages that have structured the history of the world, namely, Adam and Christ. While Paul seems to assume that Adam, like Christ, was a discrete individual who lived in the past, of far greater importance for Paul’s thought is the representative nature of these two figures. Adam represents one way of pursuing human life, namely, life in rebellion against God, while Christ represents another way of pursuing human life, namely, life in a positive relation to God. In addition, Paul, who knew Hebrew, also knew that in Hebrew “adam” is the generic term for a human being. Whatever Paul may have thought about Adam as an individual, therefore, he also was aware that the author of the story in Genesis intended this figure to represent humankind as a whole.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Adam’s Sin</p>
<p class="sbaft">The following quotation from 4 Ezra 7:46–50 (= 2 Esdras 7:116–120) shows an understanding of the effects of Adam’s sin that probably dates to the first century:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">This is my first and last word: It would have been better if the earth had not produced Adam, or else, when it had produced him, had restrained him from sinning. For what good is it to all that they live in sorrow now and expect punishment after death? O Adam, what have you done? For though it was you who sinned, the fall was not yours alone, but ours also who are your descendants. For what good is it to us, if an eternal age has been promised to us, but we have done deeds that bring death? And what good is it that an everlasting hope has been promised us, but we have miserably failed? Or that safe and healthful habitations have been reserved for us, but we have lived wickedly? <em class="calibre5">(OTP)</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg316" class="calibre3"></a>Paul begins this passage by pointing out that since death is the consequence of sin and is universal, sin must be similarly universal. Sin, in the form of rebellion against God’s will, is present when people disobey the law of Moses as surely as it was in Adam’s refusal to follow what God had commanded in the Garden of Eden (5:12–14a). Thus, once again (as in 3:9–20), Paul’s point is that no one, Jew or Gentile, can claim to be free of rebellion against God. Yet Adam, in setting the pattern for human rebellion, was a reflection of another person who would set a different pattern, namely, Christ (5:14b). Yet Paul wants to make clear that what God did in Christ, namely, act for the reconciliation of sinners, was a far more potent act than Adam’s act of rebellion, which represents the way human beings have reacted to God. If it were not, it could not overcome the results of such rebellion (5:15–17). Paul states his conclusion in a reiteration of the contrasting parallelism between the results of Adam’s rebellious disobedience and Christ’s act of righteous obedience (5:18, 19). The law — and Paul means here the law of Moses, the Torah — served to make painfully evident the extent of human rebellion against God, but such rebellion finally could not overcome God’s grace. God’s grace is stronger than sin, so that even though sin brought death, God’s grace brought a life that overcomes such death (5:20–21).</p>
<p class="calibre8">What conclusion are Paul’s readers to draw from the fact that increase in sin simply caused God’s grace to increase even more? Should they provoke more grace by creating more sin? Paul’s answer is interesting. No, he says, that is not an option, because dead people cannot sin, and as far as sin is concerned, you are dead! Paul can make that statement to his Christian readers because he can assume they have all been baptized, and baptism, he says, links them to Christ’s death. But that dead people cannot sin does not help them very much, because dead people cannot do anything else either. Baptism into Christ, however, means sharing not only his death on the cross, but also his risen life. Christians, baptized into Christ’s death, therefore now live on the other side of death, sharing in Christ’s risen life. But, note carefully, Paul does not say that as Christians have died with Christ, so they have also <em class="calibre5">risen</em> with Christ. For Paul resurrection, transformation into spiritual bodies, lies in the future, after God’s universal judgment. Therefore, here as elsewhere in this letter, the Christian’s resurrection is always spoken of in the future tense. Christians may walk now in newness of life because God raised Christ (6:4), and they are so to regard themselves (6:11), but only in the future will they be raised as Christ was raised (6:5, 6, 7). Since Christians share in that life but do not yet possess it, they are still open to the possibility of falling back into sin; old habits die hard. They must therefore strive not to fall back, because they have been given this new life.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Next question: does this mean that Christians can sin because what controls them now is not law but grace (6:15)? No, because to sin is to be a slave to sin, and that may describe their former state but not their present state. Now they are slaves <a id="pg317" class="calibre3"></a>to God, freed from sin and open to yield their lives to righteousness (6:16–23). Furthermore, because by their baptism they have shared in Christ’s death, they are no longer under the law. But how can someone else’s death affect my relationship to the law? Paul’s example is the married woman: when her husband dies, her relationship to the law has changed. What the law once said to her as a married woman it no longer says because she is a widow. What once would have been adultery — marrying another man — is adultery no longer (7:1–3). Similarly, Christ’s death means that Christians can now belong to another, namely, Christ, instead of to sin. Enslaved to sin as they were and now freed by Christ’s death, the Christian is now free, as was the widow, to belong to another, namely, Christ. This is important because what the law does is arouse sinful passions (7:5). Now free from the law by Christ’s death, however, the law no longer has that effect.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Another question: does that mean that the law is sin (7:7)? No, despite the close link between law and the sinful passions it is capable of raising (7:8–9). It is not the law that is sinful but rather the actions sin can provoke when it takes over the law (7:10–11). The law itself is in fact holy and good (7:12). Does that mean that the good law brought evil consequences, sin and death (7:13)? No, it was sin, which took over the law, that did that. The problem is that the law is not strong enough to resist the power of sin, with the result that sin can take it over and make it serve evil rather than good ends because, while the law is spiritual, the human being is “flesh,” that is, enslaved to sin (7:14).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Here we confront a puzzle in trying to understand what Paul is saying. Who is this “I” that he keeps talking about in Romans 7? Some have said it represents Paul as a Christian, and describes the dilemma any Christian undergoes who knows of God’s righteous act in Christ and yet is still tempted into sin. Yet Paul’s description of the “I” in 7:14 makes that interpretation impossible, since the “I” is “sold under sin,” something Paul has been at pains to say is precisely not the state of the Christian (6:6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20 [“were,” not “are,” slaves to sin], 22; 7:4, 6), a topic he will resume as soon as he is finished with this discussion (8:1, 2). Given that description of the Christian, whoever else the “I” is in 7:14, it cannot be a Christian.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Perhaps it represents the way Paul the Pharisee felt before he became a Christian. Perhaps it was precisely the despair the “I” felt under the law (7:15–24) that drove Paul when he was under the law to turn to Christ. Yet nowhere does Paul say he was in despair over the law when he was a Pharisee! The only thing he says about himself is that as far as doing right under the law was concerned, he was blameless (Phil 3:6b).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Most likely, the “I” is used here to describe a situation typical of a person under the law, such as Paul before his conversion, but not the inward feelings of such a person, a subjective description as it were, but what such a life looks like from a Christian perspective. It is therefore an objective description of the situation of <a id="pg318" class="calibre3"></a>such a person, which is not known to that person until he or she becomes a Christian and can look back and see the dilemma they were in. From such a perspective, the “good” of which Paul speaks is doing God’s will, and that means, since the advent of Christ, trusting in Christ rather than in the law for being right with God. But it was the law that led Jesus’ contemporaries — including Paul! — to reject Jesus. Thus, seeking to do the good — that is, obeying God’s will — they did just the opposite when, because of the law, they opposed Christ. That is the objective dilemma of anyone seeking to be right with God through the law. The very act of taking the law with utmost seriousness led those people, on that basis, to reject God’s will expressed in Christ — that is, the “good.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">“Flesh” and “Body”</p>
<p class="sbaft">“Flesh” and “body” are neutral terms for Paul, and the meaning in any given case must be determined by the context. They can refer to the physical components of human existence, but they can also be used with respect to how one carries on one’s life. In ethical contexts, the words tend to portray ways of living.</p>
<p class="sb">Thus, “flesh” can be used in a completely neutral way to describe the physical side of life (e.g., Rom 9:3; 1 Cor 15:39), as can “body” (e.g., 1 Cor 5:3; 15:37–38, 44). On the other hand, “flesh” can be used in a negative sense, to indicate life separated from God, and not in accord with the divine will, that is, life in sin (e.g., Rom 7:25; 8:5–8; Gal 6:19), as can “body” (e.g., Rom 1:24; 6:6; 8:13). Further, “flesh” can be used in a positive sense to describe one’s physical life in accordance with God’s will (e.g., Gal 2:20; 2 Cor 4:11; Rom 1:3), as can “body” (e.g., Rom 8:23; 1 Cor 6:15; 7:34).</p>
<p class="sbl">Therefore, Paul does not imply that physical life, that is, life in the flesh or in the body, is necessarily evil. It is only when life has its center in something other than God that it is evil and in rebellion against God.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">It is not a matter of a moral dilemma. The problem is not the inability to will the good. Paul says explicitly such a person can in fact will to do the good (7:18), that is, will to do what God wants. The problem is that under the law such willing produces the opposite of what the person wants. It is not <em class="calibre5">willing</em> the good, that is, accepting God’s will, that is the problem, it is <em class="calibre5">doing</em> the good, that is, following Christ, and it is just that that the law prevents. And all of that, says Paul, simply proves that the problem with the law when it is under the power of sin is that following it simply leads to more sin. The law is no help in escaping sin; it simply <a id="pg319" class="calibre3"></a>drives a person deeper and deeper into it. That is the objective dilemma of the person who relies solely on the law to point to the way to do God’s will. As the fate of Jesus at the hands of those who followed the law showed, a fate Paul the Pharisee actively approved, it led to the utter rejection of Jesus as the expression of God’s will.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If Rom 7:13–23 is thus a description of the past, namely, what life under the law looks like from a Christian perspective, the next segment (8:1–39) is a reflection on the present, namely, what life under Christ and freed from the law looks like from a Christian perspective. That life is one in which the enmity between God and human beings is at an end because life is now dominated by the Spirit of Christ rather than characterized by rebellion against God (“flesh”) and led astray by the law. To set one’s mind on the latter mode of life brings death, but to set the mind on what God has done in Christ brings life (8:6–7).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Because life is the future of those who trust Christ, Paul argues that any suffering devotion to Christ may bring is like nothing compared to that future, a future that will include the restoration not only of individuals but of the whole of creation itself (8:18–25). With the presence of God’s Spirit assured (8:26–27), Christians may face the future unafraid, confident that God will not withdraw the love and mercy he has shown, and promised, in Jesus Christ. Nothing, finally, can separate the Christian from the loving care of that God (8:28–39).</p>
<p class="calibre8">That affirmation raises one final problem for Paul, and it concerns precisely the trustworthiness of God’s word. God has promised that in Christ nothing can separate us from the divine love, and yet the Jews, God’s chosen people, have turned away from God and shut themselves off from God’s mercy in Christ. How can Christians be sure it may not also happen to them? If the chosen people have been abandoned, how can Christians, as new “chosen people” (8:28–30), be confident that it could not also happen to them? Did God’s word fail, if only some in Israel are among those who have accepted God’s gift in Christ (9:1–5)?</p>
<p class="calibre8">That is the problem Paul deals with in the next three chapters (9–11), and he begins by assuring his readers that God’s word did not in fact fail (9:6). The reason: God has always dealt with a remnant in Israel (9:6–13), which demonstrates that his dealings with his chosen people were based on mercy, not racial descent or human effort (9:14–16). That same gracious activity is seen in the events of the exodus and in the way God dealt with Pharaoh; the purpose was to show God’s power and make known the divine name (9:17–18), so that people would know who is in control of history. In those events, God was acting as the creator, with ultimate power over his creation. Yet how he deals with creation nevertheless makes known his power and demonstrates his mercy (9:19–23), a mercy now continued when God includes Gentiles as well as Jews in his chosen people (9:24–26). To sum up, God historically demonstrated his mercy by dealing with a remnant of Israel, who but for that mercy would also have perished (9:27–29).</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg320" class="calibre3"></a>In fact, it should now be clear that it was not God’s word but Israel that failed. Israel did not see that the way to relate to God was through trust, not racial descent (“law”). That is why they rejected God’s mercy in Christ, to whom in fact that law pointed and in whom that very law was fulfilled (9:30–10:4). That means, as Paul argued earlier (3:30), that trust also represented the basis of Israel’s law, the reality to which it pointed. Hence one is to live in covenant (righteousness) with the God who gave that law to engender trust, not “works of the law” (race). Because of that fact, Gentiles as well as Jews are included in God’s mercy (10:5–13). Such trust is based on hearing the apostolic proclamation of God’s gracious acts in Christ (10:14–17). But perhaps Israel could plead that it had not heard that proclamation (10:18) or understood it (10:19). Yet in fact it was not God who abandoned them (10:20) but they who abandoned God (10:21).</p>
<p class="calibre8">That God has not abandoned the Jews, his chosen people (11:1a), is demonstrated by Paul, also a Jew, who has accepted Christ in trust. This simply shows that God has continued his historic practice of working with a remnant of the Jews, the remnant currently being those whom God has set aside as the group who trusts in Christ (11:1b-6; cf. 9:6–13), the remnant Paul earlier identified as those who share not the Jewish genetic pool but the faith of their forefather Abraham (4:11–13). This final remnant of the Jews was created by the fact that the majority of Israel was hardened and so did not accept the renewed relationship with God based on trust in Christ (11:7–10).</p>
<p class="calibre8">That hardening did not have as its purpose the destruction of those hardened, however (11:11). Rather, they, like Pharaoh before them, who was also hardened, were hardened as part of God’s merciful plan to include Gentiles as well. In a sense, room had to be created for Gentiles within God’s chosen people, and such room was created by hardening, and thus excluding, a part of the Jews.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Gentiles must not think, however, that that shows their natural superiority over the Jews, nor come to the conclusion that God liked them better and so hardened Jews on their behalf (11:11–24). Like an olive tree that has had some branches broken off so that others can be grafted in, those engrafted branches do not naturally belong there, but are there by grace, as it were. So it is with the Gentiles: they have come to share in the promises of Israel (the “root,” v. 18) and must respond with gratitude for such kindness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Yet that is not the end of the story. If God’s acts are characterized by such kindness, then it will also finally be shown to the natural branches that were broken off in the first place. In fact, it is part of God’s mysterious redemptive plan that part of Israel be hardened until the Gentiles enter into God’s promises, but then finally, the remainder of Israel that was hardened will finally also be accepted back in (11:26–27). The mysterious hardening of a part of Israel is thus not permanent; in the end, that part of Israel too will return to Christ and so be saved, since their call as chosen people, despite their temporary opposition to Christ, is irrevocable <a id="pg321" class="calibre3"></a>(11:25–29). That finally is the answer to the question that prompted this whole discussion (chs. 9–11): Christians may have confidence in the God who called them in Christ because, in the end, such a call is, as the call even to an apparently abandoned Israel shows, in fact irrevocable.</p>
<p class="calibre8">All of this shows that disobedience followed by obedience is the way God has carried out his redemptive plan. All people, both Gentiles and Jews, were disobedient so that God’s mercy finally could be shown to all of them (11:30–32). Paul concludes by acknowledging that such a divine plan is impossible for human reason to fathom; it comes from the God who alone controls all things, and therefore the only proper response for the creatures to whom God has shown mercy is to give glory to him (11:33–36).</p>
<p class="calibre8">After concluding the exposition of his Gospel, Paul turns in the final portion of Romans to a discussion of how trust in God and in Jesus Christ finds its expression in the structures of life in a world between the beginning of the new age, inaugurated with Christ’s resurrection, and the end of the old age, which will occur with his return in glory. Paul states the theme for this discussion in 12:1–2 and then shows how it works itself out in life with other human beings, both within the Christian confession (12:3–13) and in secular society (12:14–13:10). In the middle of this section, Paul looks at the relationship of the Christian to the secular state (13:1–7). Convinced that anarchy is not a Christian possibility, Paul shows how Christians are to live in terms of the state, following the laws that punish evil and promote good. In so defining the state, Paul makes clear that the God-willed function of the state is to promote the good of its citizens. How Paul would react to a state whose laws sought actively to harm some of its citizens he does not say, but it is clear that these verses are not a call to absolute obedience to anything and everything a state may command its citizens to do. The state Paul describes is defined in 13:3–4, and that is the state he is talking about. Paul concludes this discussion by pointing out that Christians are to hold themselves to a higher standard than that of a debauched society (13:11–14).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Paul concludes this final portion of his letter with the discussion of a concrete example of how Christians, under God’s gracious lordship enacted in Christ, are to conduct themselves in regard to differences among Christians (14:1–15:13). Paul uses as his example the difference between the “weak,” that is, those who feel it necessary to follow certain dietary restrictions, and the “strong,” that is, those who find such restrictions unnecessary (14:2). The point of his long discussion is that neither group should regard their dietary practices as so superior that they are willing to sacrifice fellowship with the other group simply in order to insist on their own way of doing things. Rather, they should be willing to act in such a way as to please others rather than themselves and therefore be willing to welcome one another because, finally, that is the way Christ also acted (15:3, 7). Paul concludes his letter by outlining his travel plans (15:14–33) and sending greetings (16:1–16, 21–23), along with a final exhortation (16:17–20) and a benediction (16:25–27).</p>

<p class="sbah"><a id="pg325" class="calibre6"></a>Hierocles, <em class="calibre37">On Duties,</em> “How to conduct oneself toward one’s fatherland” 3.39.34–36:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="sbbqf">The person who prefers one finger to the five is stupid. . . . In the same way, that person also is stupid who wishes to save himself more than his fatherland, and in addition acts unlawfully and desires the impossible, while he who honors his fatherland more than himself is dear to the gods and firm in his reasoning. Nevertheless, it has been said that even if one were not numbered with the system but were examined separately, it is fitting that he prefers the preservation of the system rather than his own. For the destruction of the city shows that there is no preservation of the citizen, in the same way that the destruction of the hand involves the destruction of the finger as part of the hand. Let us then sum up, that we should not separate what is publicly profitable from what is privately profitable, but to consider them one and the same. For what is profitable to the fatherland is common to each of its parts, since the whole without its parts is nothing. And what is profitable to the citizen is also fitting to the city, if indeed it is taken to be profitable to the citizen. . . .</p>
<p class="sbbql">Because of this, I say, the person who would conduct himself well toward his fatherland should get rid of every passion and disease of the soul. He should also observe the laws of the fatherland as secondary gods of a kind and be guided by them, and, if someone should attempt to transgress them or introduce innovations we should with all diligence prevent him and in every way possible oppose him. For it is not beneficial to a city if its laws are dishonored and new things are preferred to the old. (from Abraham J. Malherbe, <em class="calibre5">Moral Exhortation: A Greco-Roman Sourcebook</em> [Philadelphia: Westminster, 1986], 89–90)</p>

<p class="calibre8">For whatever reason — that Paul had never visited the church to which he was writing, that he wanted them to understand the gospel he would be carrying to Spain, that he wanted to dispel misunderstandings he knew to be abroad concerning his proclamation of the faith, that he had no questions from his addressees that he needed to answer — unlike virtually all his other letters, the argument in Romans is a sustained one, particularly through the first eleven chapters. It is thus necessary to consider the whole argument step-by-step in the order Paul has presented it, since understanding any part of it depends on understanding its entire sweep. It is not a systematic treatment of all major Christian positions and practices — there is no mention, for example, of the Lord’s Supper — but its sustained argument gives us enough of a picture of the form and focus of Paul’s proclamation that it can well be used as a kind of intellectual map by which to orient ourselves as we explore the remainder of the Pauline theological landscape. For that reason, it is an appropriate letter to begin the study of the Pauline collection contained in the NT.</p>
