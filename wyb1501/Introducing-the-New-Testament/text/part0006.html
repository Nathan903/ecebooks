<p class="ct"><a href="part0002.html#rch02" class="calibre6">The World of the New Testament</a></p>
<p class="pf">The New Testament is in Greek. The ease with which we accept this fact masks two important realities. First, with such an array of modern translations in English, the NT is readily accessible to us — so much so that we perhaps too easily assume that its words, familiar to us in translation, also carry commonplace meaning from our world. Reading the NT today in English, it is easy to imagine that people in the ancient Mediterranean world experienced life much as we do.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Second, when we recall that the NT is written in Greek we are reminded of the impressive gains made by Alexander the Great and the cultural forces he initiated in the fourth century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>. By the time of Jesus and Paul, Luke and John, the world of the NT had been the setting of almost four hundred years of <em class="calibre5">cultural influence from the Greeks.</em> The very language in which the NT was written provides evidence of the reach of the massive cultural transformations that shaped the NT period.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In more recent decades, Rome had come to occupy a significant place on the landscape of the NT world. Rome, with its institutions and agents, infiltrated the larger Mediterranean world, and the NT books were written well after the arrival of <em class="calibre5">Roman political dominion</em> in Palestine and far beyond. As a renewal movement within Judaism, moreover, the early Christian movement was drawn out of and itself drank deeply from the well of the <em class="calibre5">formative traditions and life of Israel.</em> This is perhaps seen most fully in the use of the Scriptures of Israel as a crucial ingredient in religious and ethical discourse, in the shared belief in Yahweh, the one God, and in the presence and influence of Jewish forms of worship in the pages of the NT. Underlying and pervading the writings of the NT, then, is the convergence of these three great rivers of tradition: Israel, Greece, and Rome.</p>
<p class="calibre8">How those traditions should be understood with respect to their influence on <a id="pg16" class="calibre3"></a>the life and thought of the early Christian movement is not and cannot be a matter of dispassionate reporting, however. In our study of the book of Revelation, for example, we might encounter two fundamentally opposed perspectives on Rome. On the one hand, one might understand Rome — the city, the empire, and all that came to represent Roman civilization — as an agent of world peace, midwife of economic stability, supplier of jobs, builder of highways and aqueducts, merchant of the seas. One might even refer to Domitian, emperor of Rome during the time when Revelation was written, as “lord and god” (Suetonius, <em class="calibre5">Domitian</em> 13). On the other, Rome could be understood as a blasphemous power whose every move was calculated to frustrate the purpose of God and to compromise the faith of God’s people. Not as the savior of the world, but as “a habitation of demons and haunt for every unclean spirit” — this is how Rome is characterized by John’s Revelation (18:2). <em class="calibre5">Pax Romana</em> (Roman peace), then, is only one way to characterize the spirit of the NT world. Peace is important to this era, but it is also selective. Peace for whom? At what price? At whose expense?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Among the twenty-seven books that comprise the NT, Revelation is not alone in providing this tale of two cities. Nor is Rome the only prominent fixture on the horizon of the NT world to be viewed in such an ambivalent way. This underscores at once the importance of our understanding the broader world in which the NT books were written. It also highlights the importance of recognizing how those various writers perceived and addressed that world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In other words, in order to grapple with the message of NT texts, we need an understanding of the world in which that message took shape and found meaning for our ancestors in the faith as they grappled with the concrete implications of the gospel. Because our world is not simply a recapitulation of theirs, we need to achieve as full a description of that world as possible. After all, all language is embedded in culture. In order to gain a hearing in their first-century world, NT writers had to work with the pre-understandings, values, thought patterns, and language of their world. This is not to say, however, that the NT writers were so trapped in their worlds that they could not point beyond them. In order to proclaim and define their message <em class="calibre5">as good news,</em> those writers had to move beyond what was already normal in their world in order to challenge it and, indeed, to portray an alternative world, the world purposed by God and manifest in Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The invitation to read the NT is in part a summons to enter into its sometimes familiar, sometimes strange world. Learning to listen to its message from within that world is a lifelong process of becoming sensitive to the everyday realities largely taken for granted by people of those first-century communities of faith. We can begin this process by adopting an interpretive framework that highlights, first, <em class="calibre5">environmental conditions</em> (the big picture of the general cultural, political, and economic contours of the period) and, second, <em class="calibre5">institutional contexts</em> (fundamental patterns of behavior supported in that world, together with the <a id="pg17" class="calibre3"></a>organizations that propagate those patterns).<a href="part0006.html#ch02en01" class="enref" id="rch02en01">1</a> First, however, it will be helpful to draw a crucial distinction regarding the several ways we may understand the phrase, “the world of the New Testament.”</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch02ah01"><a href="part0002.html#rch02ah01" class="calibre6">2.1. THE MANY WORLDS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</a></p>
<p class="pf">Every description of a “world” is from a particular perspective. It is true that we might all count the same number of trees in a given area, but their significance depends on who is doing the counting. If a farmer, those trees may be looked upon with disdain, an obstacle to enhanced productivity. Children may have visions of ropes and tires draped from those limbs as makeshift swings. Zoologists, lumber companies, and environmentalists will each have their own competing viewpoints. As a matter of course, we render the world in relation to ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What is more, we tend to assume that our rendering of the world is “the way the world is” in itself, or even the way God made the world. Not surprisingly, then, we also tend to assume that others — local and far removed, past and present — share (or should share!) our understanding of reality. For this reason, our efforts at locating the NT in its own world require that we suspend some of our judgments about the nature of the world. We must do so in order to listen to sometimes alien voices and perspectives. This is a world where Jesus can be said to walk on water and raise the dead, where speaking in tongues can serve missionary ends, where the institution of slavery was largely taken for granted, where the measure of one’s wealth was not as important as the measure of one’s status, where the extended family was the basic social and economic unit, and where all of life was lived in varying degrees under the shadow of the empire. An important prerequisite for those of us who want to understand the writings of the NT will be to place our judgments regarding the values and institutions of its world in abeyance. Increasing our awareness of the taken-for-granted realities of those who inhabited the world of the NT will help us to understand better the message of the NT. Reading the NT is, in part, an exercise in intercultural communication.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What do we mean by the “world of the NT”? This phrase can have several nuances. First, we may refer to <em class="calibre5">the social-historical realities of the first-century Mediterranean world</em> in which the events to which the NT refers took place and in which the writings themselves took shape.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This initial focus on the “real world” brings to the surface an immediate problem. The NT writings derive from the first-century Mediterranean world, but <a id="pg18" class="calibre3"></a>even this was no monolithic society. When one speaks of the world of the NT, then, one must differentiate between, say, the world of Palestine and the world of Achaia (the southern portion of Greece). Each had its own history, its own ethnic mix, its own view of everyday life, and, among the followers of Jesus, its own distractions and temptations. And even within Palestine such distinctions must be drawn: the whole land of Israel versus the holy city of Jerusalem, rural Palestine versus urban, Galilee versus Samaria, and so on. Although from a sociological vantage point some generalizations are not only possible but also necessary, our readings of the NT will benefit from our sensitivity to the varieties experienced by people in this real world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We have access to this world not only via the writings of the NT, but also through other sources. One thinks of the Jewish historian Josephus (37–<em class="calibre5">ca.</em> 100 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>). Born in the years immediately following Jesus’ death, Josephus wrote in part to represent Jewish culture and religion to a Roman audience. Portions of his multivolume <em class="calibre5">Jewish Antiquities</em> and most of his account of <em class="calibre5">The Jewish War</em> help to fill in the sociohistorical picture of first-century Palestine. Of course, like any historian, ancient or modern, Josephus worked with his own biases — for example, his concern to portray to his fellow Jews Roman conduct <em class="calibre5">vis-à-vis</em> the Jewish people in the best light. Apart from Josephus other writings are of significance: the books of <a id="pg19" class="calibre3"></a>the Alexandrian Jew Philo, a contemporary of Paul, for example; the Dead Sea Scrolls along with other writings of Palestinian Judaism, which provide valuable insight into the diversity of the Jewish people; papyri and inscriptions, together with other evidence of an archaeological nature; and, of course, the historical, biographical, entertaining, and philosophical writings of the larger Greco-Roman world.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre8">None of these source materials is complete or objective. Nor can we expect the various writings of the NT to represent exhaustively the many and diverse ingredients of the real world of the first-century Roman Empire. These materials are partial, both in the sense of being incomplete and in the sense of arising out of particular commitments. Hence, there is, second, <em class="calibre5">the world as the NT materials actualize it</em> — that is, the world as portrayed by each writer. Given limited space, with what ingredients of the real world did each writer choose to interact? The world as represented by a NT writer will overlap with but is not identical to the real world, since authors shape their messages by emphasizing what they regard as having particular importance. Luke and John emphasize the presence and significance of Samaria and Samaritans, but Matthew and Mark are silent on these. In literary terms, this second sense of world is sometimes referred to as the “narrative world” of the author; it is the world at the level of the discourse as this is represented by the author.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg20" class="calibre3"></a>Third, “the world of the NT” signifies <em class="calibre5">the world of hope.</em> This is the world to which a NT writer points, the vision of a new era, the new world that is breaking into the old. An Evangelist like Mark is not content to present the world “as it really is,” but purposefully shapes his writing in such a way that some of its facets are undermined, others legitimated. So, although it is helpful to know as much as we can about the world of Mark (in the first sense), it is just as critical if not even more so to see how that world fares in his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If we are concerned with the world of Mark, then, we must attend to how his narrative represents and challenges the world of the first-century Mediterranean. Consequently, we will be interested above all in reading the Second Gospel on its own terms, albeit against the backdrop of what we otherwise know about the first-century world. The text is thus given a chance, as it were, to speak back to, as well as within, its own world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A further dilemma must be faced. Given that all portraits of the world are partial, with what commitments do we proceed in this presentation? In the last century of NT study, this question has focused repeatedly on whether it is best to read the early Christian movement against a Hellenistic or Jewish backdrop. It has become increasingly clear, at least in studies of Jesus and the early Christian movement, that this is a false dichotomy. Long before the time of Jesus, the threads of the Judaism into which Jesus was born and out of which the Christian movement grew had been woven together with the threads of Hellenism. Although this growing realization highlights the problem of proceeding with too narrow an emphasis on one tradition or the other, still our dilemma remains in a revised form. To what degree had Hellenism and Judaism been intertwined in this or that location? To what degree does a particular NT document draw on and perpetuate Hellenistic (and not Jewish) concerns? Do we read the NT materials through the lens provided by Judaism; and if so, how strong a Hellenistic filter can be assumed? As it is, this question can be worked out only on a case-by-case basis, since the answer for the Letter to the Hebrews will not be the same as that for the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hence, background issues will surface throughout the chapters that follow. Nevertheless, we should acknowledge that in what follows we will examine the world of the NT from a perspective within Jewish history. Among the several reasons for this decision the most important include, first, the birth of the Jesus movement preeminently as a Jewish renewal movement that only later came to separate from Judaism; second, the pervasiveness throughout the NT writings of the struggle with the place of Gentiles within the people of God — a concern that would arise only from an insider’s (i.e., Jewish) point of view; and, third, the unparalleled importance of the OT in its use as a both explicit and implicit subtext for theological and ethical discourse in the NT.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch02ah02"><a id="pg21" class="calibre6"></a><a href="part0002.html#rch02ah02" class="calibre6">2.2. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS</a></p>
<p class="pf">In exploring the social world in which the NT writings took shape, we will draw a general distinction between environmental conditions and institutional contexts. The former refers to the big picture of the NT world, the general cultural, political, and economic contours of the NT period.</p>
<p class="ah">2.2.1. Hellenism</p>
<p class="pf">Shaping the cultural map of the NT world in a far-reaching way were the cultural innovations and upheavals in the Near East following in the wake of the military successes of Alexander the Great (356–323 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>). Earlier in the fourth century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>, the Macedonians (located on the northern periphery of the Greek world) had not only made their bid to achieve recognition as Greeks, but under Philip II, Alexander’s father, had extended Macedonian rule to the Greek city-states to the south and the Balkans to the east. Under Alexander, a vast expanse — including Asia Minor, Phoenicia, Palestine, Egypt, and Babylonia — was added to the empire. By the time of his death, he had opened up the Near East to the migration of Greek language and cultural expressions. Parochial societies with closely kept boundaries thus began to be shaped into a more cosmopolitan and interrelated culture. Separated by different ethnic origins and cultural histories, these peoples were nevertheless joined by increasing cultural intercourse, symbolized above all by the spread of Attic Greek as the <em class="calibre5">lingua franca.</em> “Hellenism” thus refers to the spread and embrace of the Greek language, but also to the way of life, business, education, and ethos mediated through the spread and use of that language.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The significance for the NT of the cultural machinery set in motion by Hellenism is, in one sense, immediately obvious. Though its documents originated from various sites throughout the Mediterranean world, they are all in Greek. Their authors were all more or less at home in the Greek language and wrote to audiences that could read Greek or at least understand spoken Greek. Jesus and his Galilean disciples would have been able to communicate in Greek, even if their first and more common language of daily discourse was Aramaic.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The NT evidences additional Hellenistic influence of an obvious nature. Most of its citations of the Jewish Scriptures are from the Greek translation, the Septuagint (abbreviated LXX), rather than from the Hebrew text. The forms of the NT writings are also indebted to the traditions of writing known in wider Hellenistic circles. Note, for example, the close relationship between Greco-Roman biography and historiography and the Gospels and Acts, or the epistolary style of the Pauline writings. In his form of argumentation, too, Paul has been influenced — whether directly or indirectly — by the conventions of ancient rhetoric.</p>
<div class="figure" id="map01">
<p class="fig"><a id="pg22" class="calibre3"></a><img src="../images/00007.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre15"/></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg23" class="calibre3"></a>In another sense, the influence of Hellenism on the NT is less transparent. To a significant degree, the diversity within the Judaism of Jesus’ day was a corollary of the range of Jewish responses to the challenges of Hellenism. To take two extremes, Philo was willing to dress the law of Moses in Hellenistic clothing, but the Jewish community at Qumran stripped itself as fully as possible from such alien vestiges. Growing out of Judaism, initially as a renewal movement within Judaism, the Jesus movement was located at the intersection of potentially opposing challenges represented by Hellenistic and Jewish lifestyles. As the literature of this movement, the NT embodies the ongoing struggle with issues of faithfulness to God in a Hellenistic world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Because of his early death, Alexander the Great was able to do little more than set in motion the wheels of progress toward the Hellenization of the Mediterranean world. Soon after his success in the Near East, he was dead and his empire was divided among his generals. In a military and political tug-of-war, Judea was first ruled along with Egypt by the Ptolemies, then by the Seleucids to the north. Throughout this period, until the early second century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>, the Jewish people largely acquiesced to their foreign overlords; after all, the hand of foreign rule was not heavy during this period, and the Jewish people enjoyed relative freedom, not least in things religious. At the same time, however, the tentacles of Hellenism were reaching slowly, almost imperceptibly into the Jewish mainstream.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre8">In 168–167 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>, the Seleucid king Antiochus IV (Epiphanes) moved forcibly to make the Jewish people Hellenists. Even if he seems to have had support from some among the Jewish leadership, his agenda for Hellenistic inculturation far exceeded the openness of most of the Jewish population. He profaned the temple by erecting an altar to Zeus. And he compelled the Jewish people to violate the law of Moses and to transgress their ancestral faith. Jewish resistance to this forced inculturation gave rise to legends of faithful heroism, including some <a id="pg25" class="calibre3"></a>mentioned in Heb 11:32–38. As the king worked to remove the peculiarities of Judaism (food laws, Sabbath keeping, etc.), a longstanding policy of religious tolerance came to an end. Jewish groups rebelled against Antiochus and established a short-lived interval of self-rule under Hasmonean leadership. Even self-rule proved to be unsatisfying, however, since the character of Hasmonean rule did not so much reflect the original impetus toward religious liberty as an emerging desire for political independence and dynastic power. The resulting instability set the stage for the invasion of Judea by Rome in the mid-first century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh"><a id="pg24" class="calibre6"></a>A Tale of Faithful Heroism from the Period of Antiochus IV</p>
<p class="sbo">Eleazar, one of the scribes in high position, a man now advanced in age and of noble presence, was being forced to open his mouth to eat swine’s flesh. But he, welcoming death with honor rather than life with pollution, went up to the rack of his own accord, spitting out the flesh, as all ought to go who have the courage to refuse things that it is not right to taste, even for the natural love of life. Those who were in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man aside because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged him to bring meat of his own providing, proper for him to use, and to pretend that he was eating the flesh of the sacrificial meal that had been commanded by the king, so that by doing this he might be saved from death, and be treated kindly on account of his old friendship with them. But making a high resolve, worthy of his years and the dignity of his old age and the gray hairs that he had reached with distinction and his excellent life even from childhood, and moreover according to the holy God-given law, he declared himself quickly, telling them to send him to Hades. “Such pretense is not worthy of our time of life,” he said, “for many of the young might suppose that Eleazar in his ninetieth year had gone over to an alien religion, and through my pretense, for the sake of living a brief moment longer, they would be led astray because of me, while I defile and disgrace my old age. Even if for the present I would avoid the punishment of mortals, yet whether I live or die I shall not escape the hands of the Almighty. Therefore, by bravely giving up my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age and leave to the young a noble example of how to die a good death willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws.” When he had said this, he went at once to the rack. Those who a little before had acted toward him with goodwill now changed to ill will, because the words he had uttered were in their opinion sheer madness. When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned aloud and said: “It is clear to the Lord in his holy knowledge that, though I might have been saved from death, I am enduring terrible sufferings in my body under this beating, but in my soul I am glad to suffer these things because I fear him.” So in this way he died, leaving in his death an example of nobility and a memorial of courage, not only to the young but to the great body of his nation.

</div>
<p class="calibre8">The extent of Hellenism in Palestine and its influence on Jews scattered throughout the ancient Mediterranean world remains a matter of speculation. Two points are clear, however. First, the degree of Hellenistic influence depends in large part on location. Urban areas encountered more traffic and thus experienced more cultural exchange. It is clear that some urban Jews, because they followed intellectual hunger or sought acceptance and honor in the changing world or for other reasons, embraced these cultural innovations quite deliberately. Elsewhere, though, especially in more remote, rural areas, evidence of the reach of Hellenism was less pronounced and certainly less welcomed. Second, and at the same time, it must be recognized that we are dealing here with a continuum from more to less Hellenistic encroachment. Refusal to adapt to the changing world, at least minimally, was not an option. Even this way of putting things may require further <a id="pg26" class="calibre3"></a>nuance, however. The question may not be how thoroughly the Jewish people were Hellenized but rather how strongly they — as a whole or in different localities — resisted the intrusion of Hellenism.</p>
<p class="ah">2.2.2. The Roman Empire</p>
<p class="pf">Of the emperor Augustus (63 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>–14 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>), the Roman historian Tacitus (born <em class="calibre5">ca.</em> 56 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>) wrote,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">He organized the state, not by instituting a monarchy or a dictatorship, but by creating the title of First Citizen. The empire had been fenced by the ocean or distant rivers. The legions, the provinces, the fleets, the whole administration, had been centralized. There had been law for the Roman citizen, respect for the allied communities; and the capital itself had been embellished with remarkable splendor. (<em class="calibre5">Annales</em> 1.9, LCL)</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">With such words Tacitus drew attention to the general accolades enjoyed by the emperor following his success in the civil wars that had ravaged the Roman republic. The words of the historian are temperate, however, when compared with the acclaim elsewhere. Adopted as the son of Julius Caesar, Octavian took for himself the name Augustus (“venerable, revered”) following his military and political triumphs. The Myrian inscription refers to him as “Divine Augustus Caesar, son of a god, imperator of land and sea, the benefactor and savior of the whole world . . . ,” and similar sentiments are not hard to find in this period. This marriage of political accomplishment and divine benefaction was integral to the larger Roman world, even though the notion of the emperor’s divinity was more loosely held in the west of the empire than in the east. This provided an implicit legitimization of the extension of Roman power and the Roman system of governance throughout the empire.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The world of the NT is of course the world of Rome, an empire that would eventually comprise the lands bordering the Mediterranean, from the coasts to far into the interior, as well as into Europe as far north as the southern tip of Scotland and into Germany. The stretch of the empire was fortunate for Roman Italy, incapable of feeding its own population of some two million, half of whom lived in the environs of the capital itself. Rome enjoyed a parasitic relationship with its provinces, and Tacitus’s affirmation of the “remarkable splendor” of the capital stands uneasily alongside his assertion of Roman “respect for the allied communities.” The primary aims of the imperial government were, first, the maintenance of Roman peace within its borders and the occasional extension or protection of those borders and, second, the maintenance of a system whereby food and revenues from taxes made their way to the center of the Roman world, Rome itself.</p>
<div class="figure" id="map02">
<p class="fig"><a id="pg27" class="calibre3"></a><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre17"/></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg28" class="calibre3"></a>Military maneuvers and the trade and taxation on which the empire was dependent required efficient means of transportation and communication. One finds literary and archaeological evidence of Roman merchant ships, for travel on both inland waterways, including Roman canals, and the Mediterranean. The larger of these would have served the grain supply; presumably this is the sort of ship boarded at the Lycian port of Myra by Paul and his military escort according to Acts 27:6, Myra being an important stopping point for grain shipments from Egypt. Although Rome’s control of the water routes made such travel relatively safe, the weather presented its own peril, particularly in the winter months. Roman rule also supported an extensive network of roads — useful for trade and the military, but also for easier communication. With no “postal service” in place, letters would be placed in the hands of travelers — and better roads meant there were more travelers. These advances in transportation would have been a boon for the early Christian movement.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Roman system throughout the rule of Augustus and, indeed, throughout most of the first century <small class="calibre9">CE</small>, supported little bureaucracy. Military installations were spread throughout the empire but, except in troubled areas (like Galilee and Judea), direct Roman intrusion into daily affairs was minimal. For the maintenance of law and order Rome depended largely on the administrative function of cities — some of which it founded, others of which were already present — which were largely self-governing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nor did the various forms of Roman taxation result in increased layers of bureaucracy. This was due in part to the fact that taxes were collected primarily for wages and military expenses, not to provide what we might today call social services. Although Rome had a visible and direct presence in the conquered provinces through its military, it was present to collect taxes indirectly. Tribute — in two forms, a percentage of land production and an assessment (probably) for each adult male — was collected annually by cities, in Palestine by Jewish councils, acting as agents of the state. Tolls on the movement of goods from one urban area to another were collected at tollbooths in each town or city by the “toll collectors” known to us in the Gospels. These were persons to whom the business of collecting duty had been contracted by the empire. They represented the primary form of entrepreneurial, private enterprise of the Roman world and served as the front line of a system little regulated and open to gross abuse throughout the first century. Roman Italy was itself exempted from taxes, except in unusual cases where immediate and increased revenues were needed to fund a military operation. Outside Italy, the urban wealthy were also capable of avoiding taxation, with the consequence that the burden for financing the empire fell above all on the mass of the population that lived at or near the subsistence level.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What was the tax burden? Accurate figures are notoriously difficult to determine; our sources are not only ambiguous but also leave unclear how long certain <a id="pg30" class="calibre3"></a>tax rates were enforced. Estimates fix Roman tribute, in both of its forms, at approximately sixteen percent of gross income annually. However, the aggregate tribute for an area was fixed in advance of the farming year, with the result that, in cases of agricultural disaster, the overall tax burden was not thereby diminished. Jewish farmers were also expected to pay tithes and taxes to support the temple system in Jerusalem, conservatively estimated as adding an additional fifteen to twenty percent to the overall tax burden. Tolls on trade transported from town to town would be calculated and collected separately. Other taxes were levied, too: an inheritance tax, a tax on the manumission of slaves, and so on.</p>

<p class="calibre8">If the Roman government was not active in the provision of social services, how did municipalities meet their collective needs? The emperor himself modeled what was expected of the wealthy elite in every locale — namely, generous benefaction. Rather than pay taxes, the wealthy contributed time and money in the service of the cities and towns. This form of benefaction was not managed centrally, in which case wealth might have been distributed where needed most. Instead, gifts were made at the whim of givers. What is more, though private involvement of this kind was required by deficiencies in the city treasury, it was to the advantage of the wealthy that the city’s finances be kept in a weakened condition. Private benefaction was the primary means by which the wealthy were recognized as those <a id="pg31" class="calibre3"></a>most deserving of public office and prestige in the community, so only the wealthy could enjoy the honor and advancement reserved for those who gave so “generously.”</p>

<p class="ah">2.2.3. Jewish Identity</p>
<p class="pf">The onset of the series of changes among the Jewish people that set the stage for understanding the Judaism of the Roman period can be conveniently dated from 586 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>. The fall of Jerusalem, the destruction of the temple, the end of the Davidic monarchy, and the exile of Israel’s leading families under Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar profoundly shaped what would emerge in the centuries after the Exile as Judaism. Of course, the Israel of Persian, Hellenistic, Hasmonean, and Roman times was deeply rooted in the Yahwism known to us through Israel’s Scriptures, but it can also be distinguished by the fresh emphases required for a people living under foreign domination. In this case, these fresh emphases can be understood as characteristic marks of family resemblance, since one of the primary features of first-century Judaism was its diversity of expression. All Israel sought faithful responses to the cultural upheavals around them, but some Jews opposed the forms of response adopted by others. Hence, in spite of their common cause, some Jews found themselves aligned against other Jews.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg32" class="calibre3"></a>The changes that resulted from the loss of land and political autonomy in the Babylonian invasion shaped Israel in decisive ways — so much so that Josephus observes that those returning from Babylonia should be called “Jews” rather than “Israelites” (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 11.5.7 §173). Judaism, of course, saw itself as the continuation of preexilic Israelite religion or Yahwism, and shared with it the fundamental belief in one God, Yahweh, who created the world, chose Israel (the Jews) to be his people, delivered them from Egypt, and entered into a covenantal relationship with them. Moreover, even if they were ruled by foreign kings, Jews nonetheless maintained their sense of identity with the land of Israel and of the holiness of Jerusalem and its temple. On the other hand, with the Exile came the demolition of the ancient tribal structure of Israelite society. Jews that did return to the land did so as clans, and many Jews did not return but were dispersed throughout Babylonia and, in time, the entire Mediterranean world. Thus Judaism took on more a religious and less a national identity. Although the center point of this religion remained the temple — now the Second Temple, with restoration work and extensive renovations dating from the late sixth century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> well into the first century <small class="calibre9">CE</small> — this was supplemented on a local level by the synagogues, whose activities supported the fresh emphasis on prayer and ongoing study of the Scriptures.</p>
<p class="ch">2.2.3.1. Diverse Voices within Judaism</p>
<p class="pf">In the centuries before the birth of Jesus and the beginning of the Christian movement, it became clear that, in spite of foreign rule, the Jewish people would not be <a id="pg33" class="calibre3"></a>simply assimilated into the dominant culture around them. Full adaptation was not an option; instead, they would follow the law of Moses. The rejection of a merger into wider cultural currents raised the important question, How might the Jews remain faithful as God’s people while under alien rule? After all, following the Mosaic law assumed some level of distinction between Jew and Gentile. Related to this was another issue, that of Jewish leadership. This was in part a question of who would be authorized to represent to the Jews God’s just ways for constituting faithful life. In the early years of the postexilic era, scribes emerged in this role, but scribal dominance in religious discourse was soon challenged by priestly voices. In fact, the revolt against Antiochus Epiphanes was led by rural priests who were to become rulers of the new independent Jewish nation.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Josephus on the Pharisees</p>
<p class="sbo">The Pharisees simplify their standard of living, making no concession to luxury. They follow the guidance of that which their doctrine has selected and transmitted as good, attaching the chief importance to the observance of those commandments which it has seen fit to dictate to them. They show respect and deference to their elders, nor do they rashly presume to contradict their proposals. Though they postulate that everything is brought about by fate [i.e., providence], still they do not deprive the human will of the pursuit of what is in human power. . . . They believe that souls have power to survive death and that there are rewards and punishments . . . : eternal imprisonment is the lot of evil souls, while the good souls receive an easy passage into the next life. Because of these views they are . . . extremely influential among the townsfolk. . . . (Josephus, <em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 18.1.3 §§12–15)</p>
</div>
<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Josephus on the Sadducees</p>
<p class="sbo">The Sadducees hold that the soul perishes along with the body. They own no observance of any sort apart from the [written] laws. . . . There are but few to whom this doctrine has been made known, but these are persons of the highest standing. . . . (Josephus, <em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 18.1.4 §16–17)</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Another alternative voice materialized during this era, however. This was the voice of apocalypticism, a sociohistorical movement whose primary spokespersons were seers and mystics. Often living far from the thresholds of power in this much-conflicted era, such groups placed little hope in the possibility of reform and instead anticipated a new order of reality that would soon overthrow and replace the present world. Among these people and in their literature developed sometimes wide-ranging speculation regarding the spiritual world. The failure of Israel’s primary institutions, the prominence of evil, and the suffering of the righteous — such desperate times called for transcendent answers: resurrection as God’s vindication of the faithful not from but through death, developed hierarchies of angels engaged in battle against God’s foes, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Albeit in adapted form, apocalyptic themes (e.g., final judgment and resurrection) are present throughout the NT. More immediately obvious in its pages, and especially in the Gospels and Acts, are evidences of the diversity within Judaism that grew out of the sociohistorical exigencies we have outlined. Josephus refers to four parties within Judaism — the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, and the “Fourth Philosophy.” Reference to these groups begins to suggest how in <a id="pg34" class="calibre3"></a>divergent ways Judaism addressed the questions of faithfulness to God and religio-political leadership in the Second Temple period.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Josephus on the Essenes</p>
<p class="sbo">The doctrine of the Essenes is wont to leave everything in the hands of God. They regard the soul as immortal and believe that they ought to strive especially to draw near to righteousness. They send votive offerings to the temple, but perform their sacrifices employing a different ritual of purification. . . . They hold their possessions in common, and the wealthy receives no more enjoyment from property than the one who possesses nothing. . . . (Josephus, <em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 18.1.5 §§18–22)</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Who were the Pharisees? Some were priests, but most were not. They accorded privilege to the Torah and regarded the ancestral traditions of interpretation as also binding. The latter resulted in an emphasis on the laws of purity — normally focused on priests and the activity of the temple but now also transferred to everyday life. And this led to a heightened emphasis on the table and table fellowship, what one ate and with whom. In fact, the Pharisees are often presented in the Gospels as concerned to monitor Jesus’ behavior at table, for example, or on the Sabbath. Their struggles with Jesus typically revolved around faithful interpretation (and embodiment) of the law. Although Pharisees would not necessarily have enjoyed high status because of their economic or professional location in the larger world, as persons concerned with the interpretation and appropriation of the Scriptures they would have been influential in their own communities. This is especially true when it is remembered that Pharisees often lived in the villages and towns of Israel, away from the immediate influence of the urban elite, whose interpretations would have struck sometimes quite different chords. It is not easy to determine the typically Pharisaic stance toward Hellenism and the Roman Empire. This fact alone may be telling, however, for it suggests a certain ambivalence and lack of consensus toward these larger realities. Apparently, many Pharisees believed that everyday holiness before God was possible without addressing critically the status quo of Roman rule.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While Pharisees were located throughout the villages and cities of Israel, Sadducees were found in Jerusalem. They included the leading priests (the “chief priests” in the Gospels) and others of the urban elite for whom faithfulness to God was signaled above all by faithful maintenance of the temple cult. Consequently, cooperation with Rome was for them an acceptable compromise, for it ensured the ongoing, relatively independent functioning of the temple apparatus.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg35" class="calibre3"></a>An opposite perspective is represented by the Essenes, for whom separation from Gentiles, Gentile influence, and even those Jews who trafficked with Gentiles was axiomatic. Their emphasis on purity led them to separate themselves into their own communities, whether within cities and towns or in isolated sites in the wilderness (e.g., Qumran). These sectarians held an apocalyptic form of eschatology, viewing themselves as the faithful, the “sons of light,” who would join God in the final battle against the “sons of darkness.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">The “Fourth Philosophy,” as Josephus calls it, were largely Pharisaic in their beliefs, though with one important proviso — their “passion for freedom since they take God as their only leader and master” (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 18.1.6 §23). How its members demonstrated their passion for freedom is not developed by Josephus, and it would be a mistake to identify the Fourth Philosophy too readily with the Zealots, revolutionaries who would appear in the 60s <small class="calibre9">CE</small>. No doubt there were various ways of expressing dissent in regard to Israel’s enemies. Those of the Fourth Philosophy may have found their precursors in those faithful Jews who resisted the compromise of their faith in the face of their foes by giving up their lives in innocent suffering.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In any case, the groups Josephus mentions hardly tell the whole story of Second Temple Judaism. Most Jewish people belonged to no identifiable group at all, and the Gospels usually portray “the common people” as prospective believers in Jesus. At the turn of the era, numerous messianic movements and revolutionary prophets vied for attention and sought a following among the people. We should situate John and Jesus among those movements. Both men must have seemed to the Romans and to the Jewish people like one more in the line of those who proclaimed a message of renewal and sought a following. The presence of revolutionaries and renewal movements is itself a barometer of the level of unrest arising from the ongoing social pressures of Hellenistic influence and the constant economic and military reminders of Roman rule, as well as popular dissatisfaction with official Jewish responses to these alien intrusions.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Josephus on “the Fourth Philosophy”</p>
<p class="sbo">As for the fourth of the philosophies, . . . this school agrees in all other respects with the opinions of the Pharisees, except that they have a passion for liberty that is almost unconquerable, since they are convinced that God alone is their leader and master. They think little of submitting to death in unusual forms and permitting vengeance to fall on kin and friends if only they may avoid calling any person master. (Josephus, <em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 18.1.6 §§23–25)</p>
</div>
<p class="ch"><a id="pg36" class="calibre3"></a>2.2.3.2. Common Judaism</p>
<p class="pf">Thus far we have emphasized the diversity of Jewish responses to the realities of the Second Temple period. Can one speak of a “common Judaism” — that is, of a unity within this diversity? Archaeological discoveries in the twentieth century, together with increased familiarity with the extant literature of Second Temple Judaism, have underscored the many expressions of that Judaism. At the same time, it is possible by painting with broad strokes to portray those elements of faith and behavior that would have characterized most Jews during this period.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The foundation on which Second Temple Judaism was built accounts not only for the unity but also the diversity of Judaism in this period. The “Judaisms” of which some scholars have come to speak shared a common heritage, but each “Judaism” interpreted this heritage along divergent lines. Those central components of faith that bound them together, when set within the context of invasive Hellenism and Roman political dominion, would become the focal points of discord.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What were these shared elements? First and foremost, Jews of the Greco-Roman world clung to the fundamental conviction contained in the <em class="calibre5">Shema<span class="dcrit">ʿ</span>:</em> “Hear O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one” (Deut 6:4). Recitation of the <em class="calibre5">Shema<span class="dcrit">ʿ</span></em> was required twice daily (Deut 6:7), and Josephus remarks that the recognition of the one God is common to all the Hebrew people (<em class="calibre5">Ant.</em> 5.1.27 §112). Such a confession stood in contrast to the Hellenistic approach to religious diversity as well as to the early Roman position, which were characterized by the very syncretism rejected in Judaism. Although Rome ceased to be so accommodating in its religious pluralism during the period of the empire, its new distaste for syncretism did not lead it to discard its basic polytheism. Hence, throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods, the Jews were extraordinary in the wider world for their exclusive monotheism. Some Jews could portray other figures as Yahweh’s divine attendants or write of Yahweh’s self-expression in personal ways (e.g., “Word/Logos” or “Wisdom”), but this need not have marked a substantive departure from Jewish monotheism.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Second, Judaism was grounded in the belief that Israel was God’s people at God’s own behest; they were the people chosen by God, and he had initiated a special covenant relationship with them. Of course, this conviction of divine election is deeply rooted in Israel’s collective memory — in the divine promise to Abraham and in God’s mighty acts of deliverance and leadership in the story of the Exodus. Israel was to be a “holy nation,” and this required careful negotiation of the practical terms of Hellenistic reform and Roman presence.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Third, and as a corollary to these first two, God’s people responded to God’s gracious initiative in terms set forth in the Torah, God’s law. Not only did Torah relate the story of God’s election of Israel, it also set forth how that relationship <a id="pg37" class="calibre3"></a>would be regulated. The early ascendancy of the scribal office in Jewish life following the Exile is testimony to the importance given to understanding and articulating the meaning of Torah among God’s people. Later, priests would share in this function in local communities, and the reading of Torah became a cornerstone of piety for the Jew. The development and propagation of the synagogue as a house of prayer and scriptural exposition, too, suggest the central importance of Torah for Israel’s self-understanding in the Greco-Roman world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Jewish self-identity as the people of God, together with its covenantal ties to the Torah, came to focus in three practices that were generally shared across the lines of Jewish diversity. We have already mentioned the first in relationship to Pharisaic behavior — namely, consideration of food laws and table companions. The Book of Daniel, for example, narrates how Daniel was able to maintain Jewish identity while living under alien domination by concentrating on dietary concerns (Daniel 1). In the persecutions related to the reign of Antiochus IV, refusal to eat unclean food symbolized faithfulness to the covenant (e.g., 1 Macc 1:62–63). Diodorus Siculus observed that the Jews in the mid-first century <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> did not fellowship at the table with any other nation. In addition, remaining faithful to their heritage as God’s people, the Jews practiced circumcision (Gen 17:9–14) and observed the Sabbath (Exod 20:8–11). These practices were characteristic of Jews across party lines and helped to mark the boundaries separating those who lived by Torah from those who were “without the law” or “outside the law” <em class="calibre5">(anomos).</em></p>
<p class="calibre8">A fourth common element in Second Temple Judaism was the primacy of the temple itself. It is true that the Essenes (at least those at Qumran) withdrew from the temple, but this seems to be because they regarded the priesthood as hopelessly corrupt. Hence, they regarded themselves as the temple of God and looked forward to the rebuilding of the eschatological temple. It is also true that other temples had been constructed by Jewish communities, especially in Egypt, but these seem also to have resulted from criticism of the priesthood in Jerusalem by groups committed to the rival high-priestly dynasty of the Zadokites. Writing in the first century <small class="calibre9">CE</small>, though, Philo could argue that Israel’s <em class="calibre5">one</em> temple unified Israel under <em class="calibre5">one</em> God (<em class="calibre5">Spec. Leg.</em> 1.12 §67). In this way, the ideology of the temple served to bind together Jewish monotheism and exclusivity.</p>
<p class="ah">2.2.4. The Peasant and Urban Life</p>
<p class="pf">A further way of taking account of the people of the world of the NT is to recall the general opposition of urban and rural life. In the Gospels, one thinks immediately, for example, of the presence of the Pharisees in the villages and towns of Galilee. There the Pharisees appear to wield considerable power, an impression that can skew our overall picture of first-century Judaism so that we might wrongly <a id="pg38" class="calibre3"></a>assume that Pharisees were significant power brokers throughout the Jewish world. The Sadducees, on the other hand, appear to work in concert with the leading priests against Jesus from a distance until Jesus reaches the environs of Jerusalem. The antagonism between Jesus and the Pharisees portrayed in the Gospels is thus in large part a result of not only their competing interpretation of Scripture but also the physical location of Jesus’ ministry where Pharisees had carved out their primary spheres of influence.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Similarly, one can draw a broad distinction between urban and rural locations with respect to Hellenism. Village life is basically conservative, therefore biased against adopting Greek language and Greek ways. It is interesting, then, that Jesus’ ministry — according to the Synoptic Gospels, primarily oriented toward village and peasant life — is never said to have embraced the Hellenistic cities of Tiberias and Sepphoris, in spite of their relative proximity. The city, on the other hand, is often seen as the locus of change, where new ideas could win a hearing and take hold. Worthy of note in this regard is the success of the Pauline mission in urban areas. Also meriting reflection is the process and rapidity with which the Christian message, first planted on rural, Palestinian soil, was transplanted and indeed blossomed in the cities of the larger empire.</p>
<p class="ch">2.2.4.1. The Life of the Peasant</p>
<p class="pf">Peasant societies typically evidence a general (though not absolute) polarity between the city — locus of power, wealth, and privilege — and the village or countryside. In a negative way, this polarity is implicitly embodied in a statement by Paul, where he records dangers in the city, wilderness, and sea (2 Cor 11:26). Dividing the world of his experience in this way, he leaves no room for interaction with the rural populace, village dwellers; outside the city there is only “wilderness.” Paul thus presents himself as a man at home in the city. Peasants had their own biases, of course. Persons who lived outside the village were by definition not only outsiders but enemies. For this reason, urban leaders often dealt with peasants indirectly, through brokers of various kinds. The majority of the population of Palestine lived in villages and small towns, where they worked the land and fostered the central values of loyalty and kinship.</p>
<p class="calibre8">An old proverb portrays peasants as people standing permanently up to their necks in water, so that any disturbance in the water would be sufficient to cause drowning. This is not to say that peasants lived in constant worry or anger about their lot in life, but it is to point out the tenuousness of life at the subsistence level. Each year the harvest must be sufficient to produce enough seed for the following year’s planting, for the household to eat and/or trade for other necessities like salt, and for the omnipresent and unrelenting claims of outsiders (like the Jewish temple and the empire). In addition, each household faced certain ceremonial or <a id="pg39" class="calibre3"></a>social obligations — wedding feasts, for example. Under these circumstances, even the partial failure of a crop might result in a loss of standing in the community, loss of relative independence as a family unit of production, or even loss of life through starvation. The notion of planning, for a peasant, would focus on the relative stability of one year’s planting and harvest cycle followed by the next, not on the possibility of events in the more distant future. Against such a background, Jesus’ feeding of the thousands, the question of his disciples’ behavior in gleaning a field, his seed parables, and the like would have pointed meaning.</p>
<p class="ch">2.2.4.2. Urban Elite and Urban Life</p>
<p class="pf">Hellenistic-Roman cities are virtually absent in the Gospels, whose primary settings include villages and small towns, like Capernaum, which had a population of about 1700–2500. In Galilee, Tiberias and Sepphoris qualify as Hellenistic-Roman cities, and their populations can be estimated at 24,000 each. These urban centers would have stood as centers of consumption, with their needs leading to a form of agricultural industry quite unlike the family farms known to the peasantry. Beyond the industries necessary to provide food for their inhabitants (granaries, mills, olive presses, and the like), these cities spawned other markets as they served as centers of small businesses (e.g., pottery) and interregional commerce. Such cities were self-governing, each with its own council.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The city that looms the largest in the Gospels is, of course, Jerusalem, site of the Jewish Council or Sanhedrin, as well as of the holy temple. This made Jerusalem the center of the world of the Jewish people, its importance rooted in the intertwining of social, economic, political, and religious threads. In fact, geographically Jerusalem had little to commend its importance; it was not strategically located on a river or port, had no natural east-west passage for trade through the mountains, and had little in the way of natural defenses against invasion. Nor was it situated in an agriculturally rich area so that it could be easily supported. Hence, its importance was narrowly focused: within its walls was the abode of God, the sacred temple. The city survived and prospered on the revenues attracted by the temple.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The cities of the empire were normally located strategically on natural roadways and near water sources. They were centers of consumption but also of redistribution, their streets and marketplaces crowded with traders, peddlers, and the hubbub of barter. Under Hellenistic influence, many cities had a main street, with colonnades and a covered walkway, from the city gate to a public square. There one might find large public buildings — temples and the palace of the local leader. This public square or agora served as the marketplace and center of public discourse, whether for business and social intercourse or for formal and informal public meetings. Major cities had their own gymnasia, institutions for the <a id="pg40" class="calibre3"></a>education of the children of those elite able to pay the required fees. This provided a chief form of socialization and inculturation in Hellenistic-Roman life. Higher education focused above all on training in rhetoric, the art and techniques of persuasion in public life.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Peasant life might be defined by its relationship to the working of the land. By comparison, the elite, the aristocracy of the city, distanced itself from physical labor. The development of character, of virtue, the exercise of self-sufficiency, and the pursuit of a satisfying life of leisure depended on freedom from manual work. The elite were thus at liberty to engage in civic leadership and public service. Not all wealth was equal, then. Wealth that brought with it high status was “old money” — that is, money tied to the ownership of real capital and gained through inheritance, not through work. Not all city dwellers were of the elite, of course. The agora and small workshops teemed with persons of a variety of professions — leather workers, grocers of various kinds, bakers, and the like. Rather than passing down their wealth from generation to generation, these people trained their children to take on the family business.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In addition to the central role of the family (see below), clubs were prevalent in the Roman cities. These were voluntary associations occasioned by any of a number of needs — religious identity and practices, business or trade, provision for the burial of club members, and so on. Cities, too, were the locus of religion, and various forms of public worship were central to the lives of urbanites. After all, religion was embedded in the political structure of Rome, with leaders often doing double duty as political authorities and priests of the state religion. The rule of the day provided for multiple forms of religious expression, with the state giving sanction to a range of official gods. Among these, the most distinctive would have been the imperial cult itself. Particularly in the East, under Augustus the cult of Rome <em class="calibre5">(Roma)</em> was easily transformed into a cult of <em class="calibre5">Roma</em> and the emperor, or simply replaced by the cult of the emperor. In this way official religion served to convey official ideology, focusing the loyalty of the provinces on the person of the emperor himself.</p>
<p class="ah">2.2.5. Conclusion</p>
<p class="pf">As promised, in this section we have been able to paint the picture of the NT world with broad strokes. We have focused thus far on <em class="calibre5">environmental conditions,</em> a macro-picture of the general cultural, political, and economic contours of the period. We have seen the degree to which the shape of that world had been determined by the massive, sweeping influence, first of Hellenism in the period following Alexander’s conquest and then by the domination of the Roman Empire throughout the Mediterranean basin. As a renewal movement within Judaism, <a id="pg41" class="calibre3"></a>Christianity took root in the midst of these upheavals, but its shape was also profoundly determined by Jewish commitments that could not simply be swept away by these cultural forces. The possibility of faithfulness to Yahweh and to the law of Moses within the context of these formative historical realities helped to determine the many faces of Judaism in the first century. Consequently, this helped to determine the contours of the Christian movement, which grew out of Second Temple Judaism.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch02ah03"><a href="part0002.html#rch02ah03" class="calibre6">2.3. INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Having filled in the mural of the larger social-historical context of the NT period, we are now in a position to adjust our lens somewhat more narrowly. In this section we turn to an examination of important <em class="calibre5">institutional contexts —</em> that is, the fundamental patterns of behavior characteristic of the world of the NT, together with the organizations that propagated those patterns. By “institutions” we refer to patterns of expected behavior reinforced by social sanctions as well as to those organizational situations in which those behaviors and the discourse surrounding them found embodiment and propagation.<a href="part0006.html#ch02en02" class="enref" id="rch02en02">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre8">In proposing to deal with “institutions,” we should recognize an immediate hurdle. Many people reared in the West are unaccustomed to accounting for the role of institutions in human life and behavior. An almost obligatory antagonism exists between our love affair with individualism and any suitable accounting for the role of institutions in our lives. “We think in the first place that the problem is probably with the individual; if not, then with the organization. This pattern of thinking hides from us the power of institutions and their great possibilities for good and for evil.”<a href="part0006.html#ch02en03" class="enref" id="rch02en03">3</a> This pattern of thinking also keeps us from reflecting fully on how God’s intervention in the world might condemn or redeem social behavior patterns and their organizational forms — an issue of great consequence in our understanding of the message of the NT.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A second obstacle is our contemporary tendency to segregate life into discrete categories — the economic from the religious, the religious from the political, etc. Hence, we must remind ourselves that we are concerned with the world of the NT, and not our own. We are concerned with the social construction of the world of that time and place, and not with how we might understand the way the world works. How might Jews or Romans have constructed their understanding of the world in which they lived? Recent work, especially in the sociology of <a id="pg42" class="calibre3"></a>knowledge but also more broadly in cultural anthropology, has underscored the degree to which a people’s experience of the world is socially determined, communicated, and conserved. Institutions such as the Roman Empire or the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem are not only built on and belong to that socially constructed understanding of the world, but also actively work to perpetuate that understanding or worldview. Institutions at the center of this “world” come to believe and, indeed, to foster the idea that the way things “are” is the way they are supposed to be, the way they were created to be. God (or the gods) made them this way. Things as they are are divinely legitimated. Political violations are by definition religious, then, just as religious transgressions are political. They upset the moral order, they disturb the proper and regular distribution of power, and they operate according to an alternative and competing understanding of “the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre8">What are the fundamental patterns of behavior sanctioned in the world of the NT? What are the organizations that propagate those patterns? An introduction to the issues raised in these questions, with reference to the world of Roman antiquity, will provide a helpful stage for reflecting on how these institutions fare at the hands of the characters and writers of the NT materials.</p>
<p class="ah">2.3.1. Power and Sources of Legitimization</p>
<p class="pf">In order to illustrate the nexus between the religious and the political, the religious and the economic, the religious and the social, it will be helpful, first, to consider the question of legitimization in the world of the NT. Legitimization is the means by which the possession and exercise of power or the existence of superior status or privilege is justified or sanctioned in a society. It also refers to the boundaries within which power may be appropriately exercised. On what basis are people exercising authority or claiming a position of honor? How does one measure whether particular actions are legitimate? Here we will discuss briefly two examples, both drawn from Judaism and both having significance in the Christian struggle with self-identity <em class="calibre5">vis-à-vis</em> Judaism.</p>
<p class="ch">2.3.1.1. The Temple: Holiness and Purity</p>
<p class="pf">Within Judaism, holiness (as an attribute of God) and purity (without which one could not draw close to God) were interrelated and found their special focus in the Jerusalem temple. This symbolism of the temple and its function in society-at-large is formalized in a rabbinic text that describes degrees of holiness as concentric circles around the Holy of Holies: the land of Israel is more holy than other lands, the walled cities of Israel holier still, the city of Jerusalem holier still, the temple mount holier still, the rampart holier still, the Court of Women holier still, <a id="pg43" class="calibre3"></a>the Court of the Israelites holier still, the Court of the Priests holier still, the area between the porch and altar holier still, the sanctuary holier still, and the Holy of Holies holiest of all (Mishnah <em class="calibre5">Kelim</em> 1.6–9). This emphasis on relative holiness was correlated with considerations of relative purity (or ritual cleanness) and, thus, relative status before God. Lepers, for example, were forbidden to enter the walls of a city (Lev 13:46); hence, walled cities were more holy than the outlying areas. As the abode of God, as the link between the human and the divine, and as inviolable territory, the temple provided the center point around which human life was to be oriented. With its system of restricted spaces, the temple brought together the concepts of holiness and relative purity. Gentiles were to be separated from Jews, then, and Jewish women from Jewish men, Jewish priests from non-priests, and the high priest from other priests. In this way, the temple functioned as the center of the Jewish understanding of the world. It served as the center of the social world, defining what would count as appropriate social interaction.<a href="part0006.html#ch02en04" class="enref" id="rch02en04">4</a></p>

<p class="figh">Herod’s temple in the model of first-century Jerusalem at the Holy Land Hotel in Jerusalem <em class="calibre5">(Joel Green)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">The architecture of the temple thus provided the visible grounds for social inequality distinguishing different levels of competence (fundamentally by virtue <a id="pg44" class="calibre3"></a>of birthright!) to come close to the Holy of Holies, God’s dwelling place. The centrality of the temple had as its direct corollary the presumed legitimate power of the High Priest and the leading priestly families; they enjoyed the divine sanction that came from access to the court of priests and the temple itself. To priests more broadly belonged the almost exclusive right to perform sacrifices on behalf of the people, to distinguish clean and unclean, and to handle what was set apart to divine service. In the world of the NT, then, a criticism raised against the priesthood was a criticism of the temple, and a criticism of the temple was a criticism of God.</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre8">Given the temple’s preeminence, what would it mean for Jesus to speak against the temple? How could the Christian movement claim to represent God’s purpose if it did not take with utmost seriousness the authority emanating from God’s house? In compromising conventional understandings of pure and impure, clean and unclean, did not those early followers of Jesus compromise the temple and call into serious question the divine underpinnings of the world it served? Such questions were not abstractions for Jesus’ disciples in the era between Jesus’ <a id="pg45" class="calibre3"></a>crucifixion and the destruction of the temple in 70 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>. With the temple standing, the sacrificial system operative, and the priesthood active, how would Jesus’ followers comport themselves with regard to the temple? On what authority would they dissolve the social barriers — between Jew and Gentile, but also between priest and lay, male and female — authorized by the temple itself?</p>
<p class="ch">2.3.1.2. The Scriptures</p>
<p class="pf">The Scriptures were crucial for the self-identity of the Jewish people and for establishing the coordinates of their covenant relationship with Yahweh. Scripture also played a constitutive role in ongoing ethical discourse within Judaism, even if the widely assumed authority of Scripture must be counterbalanced with the diversity of ways in which scriptural texts were employed in such discourse. Pharisees, for example, tended to be more imaginative in their exegesis, Sadducees much less so. Jesus often found himself at odds with his Jewish contemporaries — not on the authority of particular texts but on their interpretation. Similarly, scriptural exegesis in the NT writings, while often recognizably Jewish in form and style, nonetheless often departs from contemporary Jewish interpretation because of Christian preunderstandings related to the relationship of Jesus and/or the church to <a id="pg47" class="calibre3"></a>Israel’s ongoing story. The prominent role of the Scriptures in discussion of community identity and ethical formation underscores its legitimating function, even if competing interpretive vantage points meant that different parties might employ the same scriptural texts and images in contradictory ways.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">The Problem of the “Old Testament”</p>
<p class="sbo">References to the “Old Testament” or even to the “Scriptures of Israel” employ a shorthand that clouds a series of complex issues related to historical ambiguities. First, before there was a “New Testament,” there could not yet be an “Old Testament,” strictly speaking. If “Old Testament” is an anachronism, however, it is one hardly overcome in historical discussion by reference to the “Hebrew Bible” or the “Hebrew Scriptures.” On the one hand, even if a set of Scriptures had been fixed in a <em class="calibre5">de facto</em> sense by the first century <small class="calibre9">CE</small>, as seems likely, this does not mean that a canon of Scripture had been formally established by this time. Of course, NT writings sometimes refer to OT books and texts as “Scripture” <em class="calibre5">(graph<span class="dcrit">ē</span>),</em> and this suggests that the authority of Scripture was operative even when the parameters of the OT canon had not been established. On the other hand, the use of the expression “Hebrew Bible” in discussions of the early Christian use of the OT founders on the reality that, more often than not, the NT writings employ a Greek translation of the OT (the Septuagint [LXX]), available already from the third and second centuries <small class="calibre9">BCE</small> onward.</p>

<p class="calibre8">The presence of God in the temple and the purpose of God behind the Scriptures thus became powerful bases for justifying the authority of certain persons (e.g., the High Priest) and the superior status of some persons over others (e.g., Jew versus Gentile). Other sources of legitimization were operative, however, and these were likewise deeply rooted in the collective subconscious of people as they lived out their lives. These shared values are often best brought to the surface in an exploration of particular shared patterns of behavior. In the Mediterranean basin, these would include the central commitment to loyalty and kinship, the relationship between kinship and economic exchange, the web of relationships accorded privilege by the politics of patron-client relations, and the cardinal value of status honor.</p>
<p class="ah">2.3.2. (Fictive) Kinship</p>
<p class="pf">“Kinship” refers to family relations and alliances; “fictive kinship” broadens this focus somewhat, embracing also those persons who are treated as though they were kin. The first-century world highlighted the role of the community over the role of the individual in a way captured well by the African proverb, “We are, therefore I am.” Whereas today someone introducing himself or herself might refer to individual accomplishment, persons in the world of Jesus and Paul might refer instead to their genealogy, their village, their community of reference. Their identities were embedded in their communities, their kin-groups.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The family was the basic social unit of the empire, though by “family” is meant “extended family” or “household” <em class="calibre5">(domus).</em> The <em class="calibre5">domus</em> included husband, wife, children, slaves, and others living in the house, and this enlarged sense of family had significant repercussions for the expansive authority wielded by the father (<em class="calibre5">paterfamilias,</em> the oldest living male ascendant) and for the transmission of wealth and status. The authority of the Roman father was legendary in the Greco-Roman world. At the birth of his children (whether the child was born to his wife or a slave woman did not matter), he was able to determine whether it would be raised within his household or be given up for adoption, sold, or exposed. His legal authority over the child’s life and death continued as long as he lived, and to this should be added his rights to scourge the child, pawn the child, allow or refuse the child’s marriage or divorce, maintain the child’s property as his own, or sell the child into slavery. Happily, a review of the father’s <em class="calibre5">legal</em> rights is not necessarily a measure of actual practices. In fact, with the onset of the empire this gruesome picture was mollified as fatherly authority began to be grounded more in affection <a id="pg48" class="calibre3"></a>and devotion rather than cruelty. Nevertheless, tales of physical (including sexual) cruelty are not difficult to locate in the Roman world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The image of the household was not limited to the extended family. Rome itself was imagined as one household with Caesar as the father of all. This portrait surfaced in the ongoing characterization of the emperor as the sire of his people, their benefactor and savior.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In a father-oriented society like this one, children, like slaves, were among the weakest, most vulnerable among the population. They had little implicit value as human beings, a reality that is perhaps related to the high likelihood that they would not survive into adulthood. Even if women procured their place in the household by bearing children, especially sons, the children themselves were of low status.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Given these realities it may be surprising to find Jesus and NT writers referring to God as father and encouraging the welcoming of children. This is an excellent illustration of how the world in which the NT was written need not be taken for granted within its pages, but might also be qualified, even overturned. An Evangelist like Mark, for example, can undercut authoritarian, father-like practices within the community of believers (e.g., 3:31–34; 9:33–37; 10:13–45), while at the same time portraying God (Abba, Father) as Jesus’ intimate and as the one who acts with patience and mercy to bring salvation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">From the classical period images of friendship had been idealized to such a degree that authentic friendship was possible only among social equals who were themselves of sufficient wealth to devote themselves fully to the pursuit of virtue and service. Friendships in this form were to be characterized by mutuality and equality, like-mindedness and mutual affection. More usual in the Greco-Roman world were relationships of a much less idealistic sort, involving intricate webs of obligation. In practice, almost without exception, claims of equality among friends were a charade. As Pliny remarked, someone might have many friends — superior friends, equal friends, lesser friends, and clients — and the cataloging of one’s friends into these categories was a function of the relative quantity of their social and economic resources (<em class="calibre5">Ep.</em> 7.3.2).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hence, social nearness and distance — one’s social relationships, whether among those who shared blood or who were friends — was symbolized especially in the forms of economic exchange into which people would enter.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch02ah03bh03">2.3.3. Reciprocity and Patronal Piety</p>
<p class="pf">The ethics of reciprocity is therefore central to our understanding of social relations in the world of the NT. Two systems of economic exchange are especially characteristic of agrarian life. The first is generalized reciprocity — that is, a transaction <a id="pg49" class="calibre3"></a>characteristic of those who share close kinship ties, whereby the exchange is essentially one-sided, altruistic, the giving of a gift without explicit stipulations for any reciprocation in kind. The second is balanced reciprocity — the direct exchange of goods of approximately equal value within a relatively narrow period of time.<a href="part0006.html#ch02en05" class="enref" id="rch02en05">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre8">Here, it is important to observe the central role allotted kinship relations, evaluations of social distance and nearness, in everyday life. People in Roman antiquity exhibit a marked concern for determining the boundaries of “our group” and stipulating the nature of appropriate interaction with those outside the group. And how one person behaved toward another economically was a function and symbol of the perceived social relationship between the two. The economic sharing — whether missionary support, almsgiving, or the sharing of community goods — mentioned by various NT voices thus assumes a Christian movement that saw itself as an expanded (fictive) kin-group.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In addition to these two systems of reciprocity, we may refer to the patronage system characteristic of the Mediterranean world — a system of relationships grounded in inequality between the two principals. A patron is one who has resources that are needed by a client. In return, a client can give expressions of loyalty and honor that are useful for the patron.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After the final victory of Octavian in the civil wars, Rome was unified not only under one emperor but also by a political order based on the ethic of patronage. Octavian took for himself the name Augustus, but also other titles. He was <em class="calibre5">princeps —</em> that is, <em class="calibre5">the</em> patron of the Roman people. He thus conceptualized the empire as a household indebted to him as its head.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Augustus assumed for himself the role of benefactor, a role that during this period was pervasive throughout the empire. Slaves were indebted to their masters, the <em class="calibre5">paterfamilias</em> (i.e., the patriarch of an extended family). Sons were under the rule of their fathers. Clients were bound to their patrons, and often had clients of their own. Patrons shared clients. And so on. Seneca observed that the exchange of favor and services in the Roman world bound together human society (<em class="calibre5">Ben.</em> 1.4.2). The resulting web of overlapping obligation spread throughout the empire, ultimately with everyone indebted to the emperor as benefactor — either as a result of his direct patronage as emperor or indirectly through networks of obligation that found their way back to him.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But even the emperor was a client of a sort, for the hierarchy of patronal relations extended beyond the sphere of humans to include the gods. The gods had shown favor to Rome, and especially to the <em class="calibre5">princeps,</em> the patron, the emperor. Although he was not always regarded as divine, he was certainly the recipient of divine patronage and served as the special envoy of the gods. Thus, the reciprocity of <a id="pg50" class="calibre3"></a>patronal relations obligated slaves to masters, sons to fathers, the elite to the emperor, and the emperor, together with all of Rome, to the gods.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In this way, the political order, the binding ethic of patronage, was rooted in the divine. The ethic of obligation found its legitimization in the gods themselves. It was sacred.</p>
<p class="ah">2.3.4. Status Honor</p>
<p class="pf">Finally, the world of the NT is one in which social status and social stratification are vital considerations. This is not to say that people in Roman antiquity were especially concerned with economic class — for example, as a function of one’s relative income or standard of living, or as related to one’s relationship to the means of production (as in Marxism). Such matters of industrial and post-industrial society have little meaning in the ancient world. Rather, the social world was defined around power and privilege (see <a href="part0006.html#fig0201" class="calibre3">Figure 2.1</a>),<a href="part0006.html#ch02en06" class="enref" id="rch02en06">6</a> and is measured by a complex of phenomena — religious purity, family heritage, land ownership (for nonpriests), vocation, ethnicity, gender, education, and age.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This does not mean that wealth is not a factor in understanding social relations in Roman antiquity. It is, but wealth is not itself the instrument of exchange for securing or advancing one’s social position. Wealth was useful if it brought higher status, but it could do so only if it were accompanied by other desirable qualifications. Thus, for example, landed (inherited) wealth was of greater significance than earned wealth, hence the importance of family heritage. Along similar lines, a Jewish priest had high status in his community because he was a priest (assuming he did nothing to jeopardize this standing), an accident of birth, as it were.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The status of Romans was based on the social estimation of their relative honor, the perception of those around them regarding their prestige. One source of honor is <em class="calibre5">ascription,</em> a focus on which would suggest that social status is a property of the external world. In this case, honor is ascribed to a person through no merit of his or her own, but is imputed on the basis of one’s family heritage, gender, or other inherited attributes (e.g., physical deformities). A second source of honor was <em class="calibre5">performance,</em> whereby honor might be gained by means of one’s actions — education, marrying well, or other conformity to socially prescribed behaviors. According to texts like Lev 21:16–24 it is evident that priestly communities accorded privilege to ascription, not performance; one was a priest because one was born into a priestly family, but any of a number of inherited physical maladies could lead one to be excluded from the priesthood. According to the NT, the <a id="pg51" class="calibre3"></a>Christian community was to throw open the doors previously closed to those excluded because of low ascribed status. Membership in this new community was not related to factors outside one’s control; instead, one could surmount such liabilities voluntarily by reorienting one’s life around the lordship of Jesus.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch02ah04"><a href="part0002.html#rch02ah04" class="calibre6">2.4. CONCLUSION</a></p>
<p class="pf">All language is culturally embedded, and the language of NT texts provides no exception to this axiom. The writing of a letter like Paul’s to the Galatians, for example, assumes shared knowledge often of an unspoken sort. The sociohistorical realities that shape a people’s grasp of the world are often assumed in a discourse. Hence, it behooves the contemporary student of the NT writings to develop as much as possible “insider knowledge” of the taken-for-granted world of the NT.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Specific NT texts often draw on a level of background information not available in a brief introductory chapter of this kind. Hence, in the chapters that follow, more specific and detailed information will be mentioned when necessary. Here we have been able to work on a larger canvas, tracing the historical sweep of the cultural traditions and commitments that coalesce in the NT era. In this way, we have been able to underscore repeatedly the level of tension operative in this world, as well as the degree to which people of this world found their identity in their kinship groups and saw and experienced life as an integrated whole. Clearly, for many people living in the English-speaking world today, our cultural experience is not that of the NT world. If we are to appreciate how the message of Jesus and his followers was “good news,” we must develop eyes and ears sensitive to the cultural sensibilities of their world.</p>
