<p class="pf">The book of Acts is unique in the NT on several counts, and its importance is largely linked to that singularity. Most obviously, Acts is distinctive because it represents the only historical narrative of events involving Jesus’ followers after the resurrection and first appearances of Jesus. Among the Evangelists, Luke alone has related for us a series of accounts that takes its point of departure from the end of Jesus’ ministry. Thus, he alone indicates in such a profound way the continuity between the story of Jesus and the story of the early church.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In <a href="part0010.html#ch06" class="calibre3">chapter 6</a> we have seen that the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles are characterized by unity at several levels, including authorship, theology, and narrative development. The most glaring sign of disunity between these two is their canonical location. Already in the second century, Luke’s Gospel came to circulate with the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John, together forming the fourfold Gospel canon. The Gospel of Luke, it was thought, could be read best in concert with other narratives of the life and ministry of Jesus rather than in conjunction with its original companion volume. Luke’s story of Jesus was thus sundered from his account of the early church, which then found its home in relation to the NT letters, especially those written by Paul. Finally located between the Gospels and the collections of letters in the NT, Acts serves three immediate functions in the biblical canon. First, it provides a bridge from Jesus to the church, showing how the movement initiated by and surrounding Jesus in Palestine developed into communities of believers spread throughout the Roman Empire. This “bridge” is more than a structural convenience that draws together the two collections, Gospels and Letters, however. Second, the placement of Acts in the canon fosters a <a id="pg247" class="calibre3"></a>certain theological perspective from which to read the rest of the NT, for it countenances the spread of the good news to the Gentiles throughout the world and sanctions the work of particular witnesses, including Peter, James, and especially Paul. Third, the chronology of the narrative in Acts provides an outline on which to hang people, places, and events mentioned explicitly and presupposed in the NT letters. Without Luke’s historical narrative, we would be hard-pressed to understand the chronology and progression of the Pauline mission, for example, and we would appreciate less fully the role of Peter the apostle and James the brother of Jesus in the earliest days of the Christian movement.</p>

<p class="sbaft">Although including the Acts of the Apostles in the canon constituted no great problem in the early centuries of the church, the question where to locate the book apparently attracted different responses. In the end, Acts played the crucial role of linking the collection of Gospels and collection of Pauline epistles. The following lists of NT books illustrate the mobility of Acts.</p>

<p class="ah" id="ch09ah02"><a href="part0002.html#rch09ah02" class="calibre6">9.2. THE BOOK OF ACTS AS “HISTORY”</a></p>
<p class="pf">The traditional role of Acts in filling in the details of early Christian history raises immediately a series of questions for students of Acts. The most important has to do with the historical veracity or trustworthiness of Acts. Can the narrative of Acts bear the weight of historical reconstructions we might want to place on it? Can we trust it to tell us what actually happened, both in matters of detail and in its grand portrayal of the progress of the early church?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Pessimistic responses to questions of this nature have led many interpreters in the past century to reject the identification of Luke’s work with the ancient practice of historiography or history writing. Some prefer to call Acts an example of the ancient novel, designed above all for entertainment, or to think of it primarily in biographical terms. This way of thinking about the nature of Luke’s second volume is problematic on various grounds. For example, in his second-century treatise on <em class="calibre5">How to Write History,</em> Lucian advised historians to give their audiences “what would interest and instruct them” — indicating thereby that even historiography need not be lacking in aesthetic qualities. What is more, we would be wrong to imagine that failure to do a good job as a historian would require that one be classified as something other than a historian. If we were to find, for example, that Acts is a poor example of historiography on grounds of historical trustworthiness, this would not be sufficient ground to require that we read it according to the rules of some other genre. Choice of genre and quality of performance are separate issues.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Having said this, though, the question remains: How does Acts fare with regard to historical veracity? How one asks this question is important, since the rules of historical writing have changed in the centuries since Luke’s day and continue to change today. Our reference earlier to “what actually happened” is actually a misnomer since it sets a standard for historiography that can never be met, not by Acts nor by any other historical narrative. Since the nineteenth century, many of us in the West have been taught to expect from historians a kind of investigative <a id="pg248" class="calibre3"></a>work concerned with “just the facts.” The truth is, none of us could write (or be expected to read) “what actually happened,” since such a report would require an all-knowing perspective and would be so full of unnecessary and unwanted details as to be impossibly unwieldy. Historians are not interested in “what really happened,” but in what they and their communities deem to be significant among the many events that might have been recorded and in the relationships among the events that are recounted.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We recognize today that every statement in a historical work has both a documentary and an interpretive force. This means that the older bias against the historian who acts also as a theologian has little to support it. Thus, the central problem on which the debate on “Luke the historian” has typically turned has had much less to do with the nature of Acts than with modern problematic conceptions of the historian’s enterprise. The view of the last two centuries, that historical inquiry is interested above all in establishing <em class="calibre5">that</em> certain events took place and in objectively reporting those “facts,” has been eclipsed by a conception of the historiographical project in which Luke would have actually found himself more at home. The primary question is not how the past can be accurately captured or what methods will allow the recovery of “what actually happened,” for it is increasingly acknowledged that the historical narration of events is always tied to interpretive commitments. Historiography imposes significance on the past both by its choice of events to record and to order and by its inherent efforts to postulate for those events an end and/or origin. Events are woven by historians into chains of causation, with the result that our interest in reading should fall less on <em class="calibre5">validation</em> and more on <em class="calibre5">signification.</em> The primary issue becomes how the past is represented.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This does not preclude our asking whether Luke has faithfully represented this or that event, but it does suggest that our primary interest in Luke’s narrative should lie elsewhere. This is because the most important aspect of Luke’s enterprise lies outside the realm of verification and proof. This most important aspect is his claim to provide a divine perspective on the events he records, his claim that what has happened in the early Christian mission has been empowered by the Holy Spirit and guided by God and thus gives expression to the ancient redemptive purpose of God. The events he recounts have been strung together in the net of divine causation, so that Luke’s claim to “faithfulness” must be measured first and foremost not on the grounds of historical veracity but on the capacity of his narrative to represent God’s viewpoint on these events.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This is not to suggest or even allow that Acts lacks faithfulness to historical events in the mid-first century, nor is it to urge that Acts should be sheltered from historical inquiry. It is rather to refocus the aim of such inquiry. First, typically, the contribution of the historian comes in two activities — the selection of events to recount and the ordering of those events in a coherent narrative. This means that, <a id="pg249" class="calibre3"></a>on matters of detail and with regard to individual episodes, we can expect Luke’s activity to have focused on visiting sites and collecting and checking reports. This is inherent to the ancient historian’s task. Second, in relation to Luke’s historicism, “historical veracity” cannot bypass the question of divine purpose, and “what really happened” cannot be understood apart from God’s perspective. To neglect the divine point of view in a historical narrative like Acts is to consider less than the full historical truth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Undoubtedly, the history of the earliest Christian movement might have been told differently by different historians with different interests. Other histories might have been formulated — focusing less on Jerusalem and Rome, more on Antioch or Galilee or Philippi, for example. Why does Peter disappear in the second half of Acts? What stories might have been told about him had Luke not focused the spotlight so narrowly on Paul and the Pauline mission? Alternatively, by using only the accounts Luke has given us, other narrators might have constructed a narrative of an altogether different sort, designed to give a comparatively novel perspective on the unfolding of events following Jesus’ death and resurrection. Indeed, we can be sure that the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem did share a different interpretation of the events. And Luke himself must have written his narrative as he has in order to shape his readers’ views of the significance of “the events that have been fulfilled among us” (Luke 1:1). In the first century there must have existed many diverse and competing ways of construing the progress of the early Christian movement — some that endowed it with no importance at all, others that emphasized more the roles of women like Mary Magdalene and Priscilla, and so on. What must be of particular interest to us, then, is that the picture provided by Acts coheres generally with the NT witness as a whole. Acts supports such overall NT emphases as the identification of Jesus of Nazareth with the exalted Lord, the continuity between the message of Jesus and that of the early church, and the portrait of the early church as a missionary movement concerned with how the gospel took root and flourished in increasingly Gentile and urban arenas.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This view of the historiographical task is less interested in whether other ways of telling the story might have been imagined, for this should go without saying; of greater interest is how history has been represented by Luke in this, his second volume.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch09ah03"><a href="part0002.html#rch09ah03" class="calibre6">9.3. THE NARRATIVE PROGRESSION OF THE MISSION IN ACTS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Perhaps the single most important clue for how history has been represented by Luke in his second volume comes in its opening chapter in Jesus’ words to his followers, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the <a id="pg250" class="calibre3"></a>earth” (Acts 1:8). Coming in response to the query of his disciples, these words of Jesus substitute a missionary program for their speculation about the timing and substance of end-time events. Just as God knows the “times and seasons” of the fulfillment of his purpose, so he anoints these followers with the Spirit so that they might operate as agents on his behalf. In a statement that will prove to be programmatic for the rest of Luke’s narrative, Jesus thus sets the future of Israel within the now more widely defined plan of God.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="list">

<p class="sbulf">The witness of the disciples in Jerusalem (2:1–6:7)</p>
<p class="sbulf">The expansion of the mission beyond Jerusalem (6:8–15:35)</p>

<p class="sbulf">Paul imprisoned and on trial (21:1–28:31)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Jesus’ references to a mission in Jerusalem, Judea (i.e., “the land of the Jews”; cf., e.g., Luke 4:44; Acts 10:37), and Samaria represent significant progress in this direction, and portend the development of the mission in Acts 2–8. They also give a centrifugal shape to the mission that is quite remarkable. Although the idea of a universal mission is not unprecedented in Israel’s history, analogous end-time scenarios typically showed the nations coming <em class="calibre5">to</em> Israel, <em class="calibre5">to</em> Jerusalem. Jesus’ missionary instructions thus fly in the face of the generally acknowledged holiness of the temple and its status as the location of God’s presence. The boundaries to be crossed by this mission are deeply rooted in Israel’s self-identity, so that the mission mandated for Jesus’ followers calls for a transformation of conventional ideas about “the way God made the world,” “the way the world is.” But in “evangelizing the poor” (Luke 4:16–30) — that is, in proclaiming good news to those of low social status (women, Samaritans, toll collectors, and the like) — Jesus had already set in motion this world-transforming, revolutionary mission.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Beyond Samaria, the Spirit-endowed mission was to continue to “the end of the earth.” Where is “the end”? Ancient geographers spoke of places like Ethiopia and Spain as “the end of the earth,” but these make little sense of the Lukan narrative. The first key for understanding this phrase in Acts is our recollection that space is never measured in purely geographical terms but is always imbued with symbolic power. Geography is not a naively given container, but reflects and configures peoples’ social world. “New York” or “San Francisco” or “South Africa” — these are more than places on a map. Their social significance extends far beyond their location, so many degrees latitude and longitude. They, like “Jerusalem” <a id="pg251" class="calibre3"></a>and “Samaria,” bring to mind powerful social forces — viewed positively by some, negatively by others.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The second key comes in Acts 13:47, where the phrase “the end of the earth” is again found, but with the sense more transparent: “everywhere,” “among all peoples,” “across all boundaries.” Luke thus encourages an identification of “the end of the earth” with a mission across all boundaries and inclusive of all peoples, Jewish and Gentile. In only a very limited sense, then, might one take 1:8 as a diagram of Acts. Much more significant is the way it identifies God’s aim within the narrative.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Acts 1:8, then, is not an outline of Acts, but neither is it a prophecy of what is to come. Rather, it is a missionary portfolio, a job description and evaluation instrument for Jesus’ followers who are to work as they are empowered by the Holy Spirit. As Jesus’ words in Acts 1:8 clarify God’s purpose, they also provide a measure by which to ascertain who in the narrative is faithfully serving the will of God. Those who obey the missionary agenda provided here are shown to be operating under the guidance and power of the Spirit and to be following God’s plan; they are authentic witnesses.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If we paint with a large brush, we can portray the advancement of the narrative of Acts in five major sections:</p>
<p class="ah">9.3.1. Preparations (1:1–26)</p>
<p class="pf">The brevity of this section may mask the pivotal role it plays as the hinge between the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. In tying together these two volumes the opening of Acts provides a sense of continuity between the story of Jesus and the story of the early church, verifying that all is progressing according to the purpose of God. It is easy to come away from our reading of this section with the impression that Luke is trying, at least in part, to address the problem of coherence in God’s salvific design. Just as the ministry of Jesus was firmly rooted in the story of God’s salvation in Israel’s Scriptures by the opening of the Gospel of Luke (Luke 1:5–2:52), so these opening verses of Acts firmly root the story of the early church in the story of Jesus.</p>
<p class="calibre8">According to the opening verses of Acts, Jesus’ ministry is unquestionably foundational to the unfolding narrative of Acts. This is particularly true with respect to Jesus’ preparation of his disciples through continued instruction; the continuing role of the Spirit — who anointed Jesus, through whom Jesus carried on his ministry, and who will now empower Jesus’ followers in their capacity as his witnesses; the continuing principal role of the imperial rule of God with its alternative vision of the world and challenge to the social order; together with the continuing division of Israel (see Luke 2:34–35), and the mission that crosses all boundaries.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><a id="pg252" class="calibre3"></a>Along with thus rooting the beginning of Acts in the Gospel’s account of Jesus’ ministry and the ongoing story of God’s redemptive purpose, the opening of Acts also begins to show the disciples in a more active role than in the Gospel and portends their ongoing orientation toward God and his purpose. This latter point is signified by the references to their continual prayer and to Peter’s appeal to the Scriptures in the matter of Judas’s replacement. Replacing Judas to bring the number of apostles to twelve is itself significant in suggesting the centrality of the restoration of Israel, the Twelve Tribes, in Lukan thought. Of course, the amount of space devoted to the story of Judas also serves as a warning that even “insiders” among the people of God are susceptible to stumbling in their commitment.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Other motifs are signaled here at the outset. Acts is introduced as a preeminently <em class="calibre5">theocentric</em> narrative, as evidenced by the emphasis on the Father and his eschatological purpose, the centrality of the work of the Spirit in the ministry of Jesus and the prospective mission of the disciples, the presence of heavenly messengers at Jesus’ ascension, and the echoes of Scripture (bearing witness to God’s design) in this section. A pivotal role will be played by <em class="calibre5">the Holy Spirit,</em> introduced as the muscle of the church’s mission. The ascension signifies the <em class="calibre5">elevated status of Jesus,</em> whose ministry and message is thus vindicated by God, and it serves as a guarantee of Jesus’ return. And finally, this opening section of Acts underscores the importance of <em class="calibre5">service as witnesses</em> and the <em class="calibre5">universal character of the prospective mission,</em> together with the related, <em class="calibre5">problematic place of Israel as a people in God’s redemptive plan</em>.</p>
<p class="ah">9.3.2. The Witness of the Disciples in Jerusalem (2:1–6:7)</p>
<p class="pf">The missionary mandate given by Jesus in Acts 1:8 called for the disciples to engage in a worldwide mission. This mission was to have its beginnings in Jerusalem, however, and Luke devotes the first major section of Acts to developing the nature of the Christian mission and community in Jerusalem. Of course, the use of the word “Christian” in this context is only a convenience, since here and elsewhere in Acts, followers of Jesus are understood and represented very much as one among other diverse groups within Judaism.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This section is initiated with the momentous fulfillment of long-held expectations. John had predicted that Jesus would baptize with the Spirit, Jesus had spoken of the Spirit as the gift of the gracious Father, and, following his resurrection, Jesus had again spoken of the “promise of the Father” (Luke 3:16; 11:13; 24:49; Acts 1:4–5). To these words of anticipation are now added Jewish thinking about Pentecost as the time of the giving of Torah and the prophetic utterances of Joel — all highlighting the importance of the coming of the Spirit at Pentecost.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This is the first of many events in Acts that recount the mighty acts of God <a id="pg253" class="calibre3"></a>and that express a need for interpretation and understanding. Here the question is what this speaking of God’s acts in other languages means. As Jesus had prophesied (Luke 22:31–32), Peter immediately emerges as a leader among Jesus’ followers, and his speech to those gathered in the temple points first to the fulfillment of Israel’s hope for the age of salvation, marked by the coming of the Spirit (Joel 2:28–32). He then weaves an argument primarily focussed on Jesus of Nazareth, proving from the Scriptures that the “promise of the Father,” the Holy Spirit, has been allocated by God’s co-regent, Jesus, whom God has exalted as Lord and Christ. This is crucial for the remainder of Acts, since it gives the basis of Luke’s view that salvation for humanity is rooted primarily, and deeply, in Jesus’ resurrection and ascension. In this way, what Joel promised regarding “the Lord” — that “all who call on the name of the Lord will be saved” — can be transferred to Jesus. Subsequently in Acts, then, believers are known as those who heal (3:6, 16; 4:10, 30; 19:13), preach (4:12; 5:28, 40), and are baptized (8:16; 10:48; 19:5) in the name of Jesus, who suffer for Jesus’ name (5:41; 9:16; 21:13), and “who call on the name” of Jesus (9:14, 21; 22:16).</p>
<p class="calibre8">Luke has more to say about the character of the community being formed among the baptized; in fact, he devotes two summary statements and two brief exemplary accounts to this task. Both Acts 2:42–47 and 4:32–35 employ images from Greco-Roman literary discussion of ideal friendship and from the LXX about the nature of obedient Israel in order to indicate how the church embodied those ideals. One may be able to hear echoes here of Essene practices and of the nature of life characteristic of “the Golden Age” — when all was held in common. Barnabas (4:36–37) appears as a positive example of behavior characteristic of this community, as he submits to the authority of the apostles and shares his possessions with those in need. Ananias and Sapphira (5:1–11), on the other hand, possess only the appearance of belonging to the community of God’s people. Misrepresenting their status as members of this extended family of believers, they act rather as outsiders who lie to the community (and thus to the Spirit). As in the Gospel of Luke, so in Acts, the disposition of one’s possessions serves as a barometer of the disposition of one’s commitments. In these and other ways, the portrait of the disciples takes on that shape portended by Jesus in his earlier teaching about those who share kinship with one another, like brothers and sisters, who hear and do the word of God (Luke 8:1–21).</p>
<p class="calibre8">This is not the whole story of the embryonic church, however. Woven together with accounts of friendship and koinonia are episodes of hostility and rejection. It is especially here that Luke indicates how Jesus’ followers have taken on the character of their leader. Like him, they participate in ministries involving signs and wonders, like him they run afoul of the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem, and like him they respond to opposition with prayer and renewed commitment to the mission to which they have been called. One of Luke’s most persistent motifs <a id="pg254" class="calibre3"></a>comes again to the surface here: persecution leads to further progress in the mission.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">Community of Goods, Friendship, and the Golden Age</p>
<p class="sbaft">Luke’s portrayal of the nature of the early Christian community is often compared to ideals of friendship and human beginnings in the Greco-Roman world. Well-known in antiquity is the proverb “Friends hold all things in common” (e.g., Aristotle <em class="calibre5">Nicomachean Ethics</em> 9.8.2 §1168b); in Acts 2:44, “believers” rather than “friends” “hold all things in common.” Images of the Golden Age in Greco-Roman literature similarly depict humanity’s primeval practice of common ownership. For example, in <em class="calibre5">Georgics</em> (1) Virgil writes:</p>
<div class="senseline">
<p class="sbslf">Before Jupiter’s day no tillers subdued the land,</p>
<p class="sl2">even to mark the field or divide it with boundaries was unlawful.</p>
<p class="sbsl">Humankind made gain for the common store,</p>
<p class="sl2">and earth yielded all, of herself, freely,</p>
<p class="sl1l">when none begged her gifts.</p>
</div>
<p class="sbo">In addition, among the Essenes we find evidence of economic community within the land of Palestine itself. Luke’s portrait thus finds points of contact with wide-ranging cultural ideals, now actualized within the community of believers.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Acts 6:1–7 forms a poignant scene of transition to the next section of Acts, for it prepares for a change of focus from the first apostles to another group of leaders in the early church, some from among the Hellenists. These were Greek-speaking Jews within the community of believers, and the vignette Luke provides shows how their influence within the church came in spite of initial prejudice against them. That their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food signifies much more than a practical problem of too many needy people and too little food. Rather, as persons who had been more open to foreign influence, who participated more fully in things Greek, they were suspect in their loyalties toward the ancient ways of God. The solution at which the church arrives is highly symbolic, for it brings some of these relative “outsiders” into positions of leadership — not simply to the work of “waiting on tables,” but into the sort of leadership service for which Jesus was already known (see Luke 22:24–27; cf. Luke 12:37).</p>
<p class="ah"><a id="pg255" class="calibre6"></a>9.3.3. The Expansion of the Mission beyond Jerusalem (6:8–15:35)</p>
<p class="pf">Jesus directed his followers to engage in mission in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the end of the earth (Acts 1:8), but thus far they have failed even to cross the city limits of Jerusalem. No doubt this was due in part to the importance of the mission in Jerusalem itself. Equally important, though, is the necessity of making clear the theological rationale for a more expansive mission. Jesus may have been exalted as Lord and Savior, but the universal implications of this divine act have not yet struck his followers. Nor will Jesus’ apostles be the first to recognize how widespread the implications of the gospel are; this innovation will come from those Greek-speaking Jewish followers of Jesus recently recognized as leaders in the community. It is through their lives that we begin to see growing evidence of the impulses toward a gospel oriented toward all peoples, Jews and Gentiles, already present in the ministry of Jesus.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Luke’s account of the witness of Stephen (Acts 6:8–8:3) is critical for the way it provides the theological and causal underpinnings for the impending mission beyond the borders of Jerusalem. Stephen is represented as an unassailable witness — he has already been authorized as a leader of the church, he is now presented in tones that are deeply reminiscent of Jesus, he speaks as he is empowered by the Spirit, he interprets the Scriptures of Israel, and he has the countenance of an angel. Yet his witness is, from the standpoint of the Jerusalem elite, highly controversial, so much so that it leads to his death as one who has blasphemed God.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Stephen first provides a selective retelling of Israel’s history to set forth the pattern of Israel’s rejection of God’s instruments — Joseph, Moses, the prophets, even Jesus, and now Stephen himself. On this basis he charges that, failing to understand God’s purpose, the Jerusalem leadership has misconstrued the Scriptures and turned the temple into a place of idolatry. Importantly for Luke’s view that Jesus and the Christian movement fulfill the program of God <em class="calibre5">from within the story of Israel’s restoration,</em> even Stephen’s critique of Jerusalem’s rebellion is cast in terms borrowed from Ezekiel 20. The end result is that Jerusalem is rejected as the center of God’s presence and thus as the center of faithful response to God. Stephen’s death symbolizes the rejection of the good news by the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem. Ironically, it leads immediately to a persecution that helps to fulfill Jesus’ words in Acts 1:8. Now, at last, Jesus’ followers depart the confines of the city.</p>
<p class="calibre8">If with Stephen we have the theological movement of the mission beyond Jerusalem, it is with Philip that we have the socio-geographical first steps. Philip, like Stephen, is one of the Hellenists brought into the circle of leadership in the church in Acts 6:1–7, and it is he who pioneers the mission first to the Samaritans and then to a Gentile (8:4–40). The interweaving of accounts on Luke’s part is important here. After the episode in Samaria, both Philip and Peter depart for other missionary endeavors, but we temporarily lose sight of Peter. In terms of story time, <a id="pg256" class="calibre3"></a>though, while Philip is engaged in conversation with the Ethiopian eunuch, Peter is participating in a ministry that brings him into contact with a paralytic, a corpse, a tanner, and a Gentile household (9:32–11:18). Luke’s readers are prepared for these innovations on Peter’s part because we have already followed Philip’s interaction with a foreigner who, as a eunuch, would have been denied access to even the Court of the Gentiles in the Jerusalem temple. This stage of Philip’s mission remains unknown to the church in Jerusalem, however, since Philip moves on to Caesarea (where we will find him again in 21:8). The Jerusalem Christians do hear of Peter’s sharing hospitality with Gentiles, and it is only after he shares with them the mighty acts of God that they are willing to accept his ministry as God’s doing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This conjunction of episodes is important for the way it brings together a number of important Lukan motifs. For example, the eventuality of a universal mission is highlighted by these accounts, as well as by Peter’s recognition, finally, that Jesus is “Lord <em class="calibre5">of all</em>” (Acts 10:36). But Luke does not portray this expansion as an easy one. At every turn it is necessary to show how such innovations are willed by God. The voice of the Spirit, the presence of angels, the giving of a vision, fresh understandings of Scripture, and so on — these are necessary as the church tries to catch up with the work of God along new lines and among new peoples.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As Luke portrays it, the mission thus far expands mostly in relationship to Judaism. The Gentiles who come to faith and receive the Spirit in these texts have already been related to Judaism. Acts mirrors the gradations generally present in the first-century Mediterranean world. There are those who are Jews by ethnic and religious heritage; then there are proselytes, Gentiles who have embraced Judaism — including the sign of the covenant, circumcision; then there are God-fearers, Gentiles on the periphery of Judaism, who identify with Jews in such practices as prayer to the one God, the giving of alms to the poor, attendance at the synagogue for instruction, and so on. Clearly, the Christian mission as Luke understands it is most successful among God-fearers, persons already familiar with the Scriptures of Israel, who have already embraced the worship of Yahweh, but who remain on the margins of acceptance, who do not really belong to the family of God’s people. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that <em class="calibre5">whether</em> there will be a mission to the Gentiles is not the central issue. As the account of Peter and Cornelius suggests, the problem with which Luke is concerned runs deeper. It has to do with the shape of the Christian community, and specifically with whether Jewish and non-Jewish followers of Jesus will be able to participate fully together in fellowship.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Before this issue comes fully to the surface, it is complicated by the work of Paul — whom Luke reintroduces between the accounts of Philip and Peter. Paul was introduced in the scene of the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58), so it is not surprising to find him again as the enemy of the church in the opening of Acts 9. Luke devotes an inordinate amount of space to his narrative of Paul’s conversion, <a id="pg257" class="calibre3"></a>partially in order to indicate the depth of the change Paul experienced and partially to intimate its nature. His “conversion” is represented above all as a “recommissioning” — to serve no longer in oppositio n to the church but as one who is to carry the name of the Lord Jesus “before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel” (9:15). Ironically, then, he who has persecuted the church now becomes the one against whom Jewish hostility will be directed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What follows are alternating accounts of Peter and Paul. This allows Luke to demonstrate Paul’s legitimacy, as he carries out a ministry that is similar to that of Peter and, indeed, to that of Jesus. It also allows for a mission that is more and more oriented toward the Gentiles, thus setting the stage for the conference on the question of Gentile believers in Acts 15. And it allows for the spotlight to turn more and more from Peter and the Jerusalem beginnings of the church to Paul and the movement of the Christian mission to “the end of the earth.”</p>
<p class="ah">9.3.4. The Mission of Paul (15:36–20:38)</p>
<p class="pf">By this juncture in the narrative of Luke-Acts the primary threads of God’s purpose to bring salvation in all its fullness to all peoples have been laid bare. What is more, the new reality of common fellowship between Jewish and Gentile followers of the Way has been secured through the general affirmation of the ongoing significance of Torah for Jews and the superfluity of circumcision for Gentile <a id="pg259" class="calibre3"></a>converts. The story that remains possesses few surprises, then, for the ways of God have been so clearly manifest; what is lacking revolves rather around the question of the shape the mission and Christian community will take as the good news spreads more and more widely.</p>

<p class="sbh">Greek Philosophical Schools</p>
<p class="sbo">By the time of Acts, already for some five or six centuries, Greek philosophy had developed along multiple lines, in part due to the lack of system or dogma in Greek religion. According to Acts 17:17–18, Paul encountered representatives of two of these philosophical schools, Epicureans and Stoics, in the marketplace in Athens and entered into debate with them. The Epicurean School, founded by Epicurus (341–270 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>), regarded the ideal life as one lived in never-ending, undisturbed happiness — free from anxiety, desire, and pain: “We say that pleasure is the beginning and end of living happily” (<em class="calibre5">Men.</em> 128). Not surprisingly, although gods exist according to Epicureanism, they are busily living the ideal life of pleasure and take no regard for the world in general or human life in particular. Stoicism, founded by Zeno (335–263 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>), placed a premium on living in accordance with human nature — that is, in accordance with human reason. This emphasis on rationality, in which both reason and nature were givens, countered any concern with social status and distinctions. This is because the exercise of reason by rational thinkers should lead to convergence in the truth. Happiness for the Stoic is not a matter of affective response but a product of virtue — virtue being understood as the craft of putting things to their correct (i.e., “natural”) use.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">The final thirteen chapters of Acts center above all on one strand of the developing mission, whose main character is Paul. In Acts 15:36–20:38 he is the pivotal spokesperson for the mission as this is portrayed by Luke. As before, Paul’s pattern is to bring the good news first within Jewish contexts, especially synagogues when he can find them. The story Luke recounts, however, is the story of ongoing hostility to the gospel among Jewish leaders and institutions. In one particularly telling account, at Corinth, it is only after departing a hostile synagogue that Paul is able to experience success in his mission among Jews (18:1–8).</p>
<p class="calibre8">This does not mean that Gentiles are necessarily any more receptive to Paul’s message. Acts 17 narrates Paul’s encounter with Epicureans and Stoics, together with other philosophically minded folk, in Athens. These people completely <a id="pg260" class="calibre3"></a>misconstrue his message, assuming at first that he is proclaiming two new gods, “Jesus” and “Resurrection.” Allowed to speak in a more formal setting, Paul denounces the idolatry of the city, urging its inhabitants to take advantage of God’s gracious provision for their ignorance by turning to him now. Again, though, they fixate on their differences of viewpoint. Hearing in Paul’s talk of the resurrection of the dead the idea of the resuscitation of a dead corpse, they dismiss him and his thinking as barbaric.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p class="fig"><img src="../images/00045.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre13"/></p>
<p class="figh">The remains of the theater at Miletus, where Paul spoke to the elders of the Ephesian church according to Acts 20</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">But in Paul’s speeches, as in the book of Acts as a whole, the resurrection cannot be put aside so easily. Luke understands the resurrection and ascension of Jesus as two events that point to the same theological reality — namely, Jesus’ vindication by God, Jesus’ exalted status as God’s co-regent whereby he is able to dispense the gracious benefaction of God. Without the resurrection, there is no Christian message in Acts, and, in these latter chapters, Paul becomes the chief proclaimer and defender of the resurrection as he testifies to its reality and significance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Throughout this section, wherever he goes, Paul demonstrates in his mission an essential coherence with the portfolio Jesus has given his followers: “You will be my witnesses . . . to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:8). Measured against the canons <a id="pg261" class="calibre3"></a>provided by the risen Lord himself, Paul appears as the consummately faithful witness. Indeed, in his farewell address to the elders among the Ephesian believers, Paul defends his own character and the character of his gospel: he has proclaimed the whole purpose of God, calling on Jew and Gentile alike to respond with faith and repentance, he has been faithful with regard to money (in Acts, a sign of faithfulness of the heart), and he has identified with Jesus in his suffering and single-minded devotion to the divine will (20:17–35).</p>
<p class="ah">9.3.5. Paul Imprisoned and on Trial (21:1–28:31)</p>
<p class="pf">If Acts 16–20 relate the story of Paul the witness, the final eight chapters tell the story of Paul the accused. Before Jewish and Roman bodies alike, Paul is repeatedly required to speak in his own defense and in defense of the message and movement he has come to represent. What becomes significant in this unfolding narrative is the continuity between Paul the witness and Paul the accused. He uses forensic settings to tell the story of his own encounter with the risen Lord, to argue that the Way he follows is nothing less or more than faithful Judaism, and to insist on the pivotal importance of the resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In these and other ways, Luke maintains his emphasis on the fundamental Jewishness of the Christian movement. Paul participates fully in Jewish rituals, he grounds his message in Israel’s Scriptures, and he addresses Jewish audiences as an insider to Judaism.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As the tale of Paul the accused develops, what also becomes clear is Rome’s lack of integrity with regard to its prisoner. Roman officials do not use the scales of justice evenly, but seek to win influence with their Jewish audiences by doing them favors. Festus inexplicably tries to have Paul’s hearing transferred from the provincial headquarters in Caesarea to the hotbed of anti-Pauline sentiment in Jerusalem. Repeatedly, Roman officials remark about Paul’s innocence, yet continue to keep him chained in order to send him to Rome. These and other narrative details like them speak strongly against any notion that Luke is writing his narrative in order to foster good relations between the church and Rome. Instead, Luke shows through Paul’s exemplary behavior how Christians ought to face accusations and imprisonment. In the face of opposition, Jewish and Roman, Paul maintains a consistent and faithful witness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Of course, Luke also takes pains in these final chapters to demonstrate that, however alone Paul may seem, he has hardly fallen from the horizon of God’s care. Paul himself is continually aware of the divine necessity that moves events forward toward Rome. And the exciting tale of the attempted winter voyage across the Mediterranean in Acts 27 is interwoven with signs of escalating danger and cause for fear, but also with myriad evidences of God’s presence and promises of rescue. <a id="pg262" class="calibre3"></a>Indeed, the closing lines of Acts have Paul continuing to speak of Jesus and the kingdom with boldness and without hindrance to all who will come, both Gentile and Jew.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Many students of Acts have come to the end of Luke’s narrative with surprise and dissatisfaction. Where is any sense of narrative closure? Luke’s point may well be that his narrative may have reached its finale, but the story to which he has given witness must continue. Not every event prophesied within the narrative has come to fruition, most notably the complete restoration of God’s people and the return of Jesus, promised at his ascension. This is no surprise for Luke, however, who has already indicated, in the opening chapter of Acts, that the present is not to be given over to speculation about God’s timing but rather to Spirit-empowered witness to “the end of the earth.” It is to such faithfulness that Luke calls believers.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch09ah04"><a href="part0002.html#rch09ah04" class="calibre6">9.4. THE SPEECHES IN ACTS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Among the narrative elements that abound in Acts, the speeches in Acts are especially conspicuous. Many of these are “missionary speeches,” delivered to both Jewish and Gentile audiences. These would include such important sermons as those delivered by Peter at Pentecost (2:14–40) and by Paul at Pisidian Antioch (13:16–41) — speeches that play programmatic roles in their narrative contexts. The study of Acts in the past century has been occupied in part with these missionary sermons and especially with the question of how accurately Luke has reproduced early Christian missionary discourse. Other speeches also have important roles in the narrative. These include Stephen’s “defense” speech to the Jerusalem council (7:2–53), Paul’s farewell address to the Ephesian elders (20:18–35), Paul’s forensic addresses before Roman officials (e.g., 24:10–21; 26:2–23), addresses by Peter and James at the Jerusalem Council (15:7–11, 13–21), and so on. Of approximately 1,000 verses in Acts, some 365 are found in major and minor speeches and dialogues in Acts, with direct address responsible for more than half of the book.</p>
<p class="ah">9.4.1. The Debate over Sources and Tradition</p>
<p class="pf">According to the primary strand of thought about the speeches in Acts in the twentieth century, the chief question to ask of Luke is not how accurately he has transcribed a particular speech but concerning the speech’s purpose in the hands of the historiographer. A speech might impart to the reader: (1) insight into the total situation of the narrative, (2) interpretive insight into the historical moment, (3) insight into the character of a speaker, and/or (4) insight into general ideas that <a id="pg263" class="calibre3"></a>might explain a situation. Additionally, a speech might (5) advance the action of the account. With few exceptions, it has usually and simply been assumed that the speeches of Acts were Lukan compositions through and through.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This near-consensus has been based on observations concerning consistency of language and style from speech to speech and between narrative and speech material. In addition, consistency of content from speech to speech, as though they were written from the same outline, has been noticed. But “Lukan artistry” and “Lukan invention” are not the same thing, and today it is increasingly recognized that the question of the historicity of the speech material in Acts has been saddled with an unnecessary dichotomy. The principal question relevant to speeches and speech-making in ancient historiography is not accuracy in its representation of this or that speech. This produces a false either-or choice or a continuum concerned primarily with faithfulness to an alleged source. Instead, ancient writers sought to achieve a twofold balance between artistic and historical appropriateness. They include speeches in their narrative representations of history not to provide a transcript of what was spoken on a given occasion but to document the speech event itself. Historiographers (like Luke) were concerned, therefore, with composing speeches that cohered with their work as a whole in terms of language, style, and content (the literary dimension) and that would not be regarded as anachronistic or out of character with what was known of the person to whom the speech was attributed (the sociohistorical dimension). In other words, literary <a id="pg264" class="calibre3"></a>aspirations do not preclude historical interests, and the presence of Lukan style and theology in the speeches of Acts does not necessarily lead to the inference that these speeches are Lukan in origin. With respect to historical appropriateness, the issue is not narrowly defined in terms of accuracy; instead, the writer would compose a speech in keeping with what could be known of the traditional data available to him.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">On Writing Speeches</p>
<p class="sbaft">For many, Thucydides (<em class="calibre5">ca.</em> 460/455–<em class="calibre5">ca.</em> 400 <small class="calibre9">BCE</small>) is exemplary among ancient historians. In the lengthy introduction to his <em class="calibre5">History of the Peloponnesian War</em> he self-consciously reflects on the inclusion of speeches in his historical writing:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">As regards the various speeches in this book, whether they were made before or during the war, it has been difficult to remember with absolute precision the things that were spoken — both for me concerning what I myself heard and for others who reported them to me. Hence, the different speakers speak as it seems to me they would most probably have spoken (if they had been heard) given the circumstances, while at the same time I have adhered as closely as possible to the general sense of the things actually spoken. (1.22.1)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="ah">9.4.2. The Role of the Speeches</p>
<p class="pf">What role do the speeches play in Acts? Their significance can be outlined along a number of related lines.</p>
<p class="ch">9.4.2.1. A Unified Worldview</p>
<p class="pf">The careful reader can discern a pattern in the missionary speeches. For example:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="blf">• appeal for hearing, including a connection between the situation and the speech,</p>
<p class="blf">• christological message supported with scriptural proof,</p>
<p class="blf">• offer of salvation, and (often)</p>
<p class="blf">• interruption of the sermon by the audience or by the narrator himself.</p>
</div>
<p class="pcon">Taken as a whole, the speeches in Acts by followers of Jesus evidence a message that is overwhelmingly centered on Christ, but one that also features a medley of recurring motifs, including the centrality of Jesus’ exaltation (i.e., his resurrection and/or ascension), together with its salvific effect; repentance and/or forgiveness of sins; the universal offer of salvation; the Holy Spirit; and, frequently through scriptural interpretation, the assurance that the message of this salvation is the manifestation of the divine will. These instances of repetition within the narrative of Acts demonstrate Luke’s concern to advance through these speeches a distinct (though not at all points distinctive) view of God’s purpose. This perspective is then propagated by each of the major figures who serve as witnesses to redemption in Acts.</p>
<p class="ch">9.4.2.2. Performative Utterances</p>
<p class="pf">Not all the speeches serve only as “commentary” on the events unfolding in the narrative. As deliberate pauses in the action, they do possess an interpretive function, but they also often have performative roles. That is, they advance the action of the narrative as they provide the logic and impetus for further developments in <a id="pg265" class="calibre3"></a>the realization of the narrative aim of Luke-Acts. The speeches of Stephen and Peter in 7:2–53 and 10:34–43 (and 11:5–17), for example, appear at crucial junctures, pushing the narrative beyond Jerusalem and Judea to Samaria and “the end of the earth” (1:8).</p>
<p class="ch">9.4.2.3. Revealed History</p>
<p class="pf">Paul’s sermon at Pisidian Antioch (Acts 13:16–41) exemplifies a common concern of the speeches to locate historical events in an interpretive web by splicing together in one narrative thread the past, present, and future of God’s salvific activity. According to this perspective, the meaning of historical data is not self-evident but must be interpreted, and legitimate interpretation is a product of divine revelation. We cannot expect to know the meaning of historical events or chains of events without their having been collated with the divine purpose. “Meaning” is available with reference to the Scriptures, especially as they witness to the one redemptive purpose of God, which has found its fullest expression in the coming of Jesus. Paul’s speech at Pisidian Antioch thus moves deliberately and naturally from divine activity in the OT to the work of John and Jesus and then to the need for present response, thus providing christological interpretations of the Scriptures and of history.</p>
<p class="ch">9.4.2.4. Acts as Witness</p>
<p class="pf">The sheer quantity of the book of Acts given over to speeches when compared with other examples of ancient historiography, along with the fact that in Acts speeches are typically given by Jesus’ witnesses or for or against the witness, suggests another narrative role for the speeches: Luke himself is giving witness, relating “all that God had done with them” (Acts 14:27). Acts thus uses speeches in the spread of God’s word.</p>
<p class="ah" id="ch09ah05"><a href="part0002.html#rch09ah05" class="calibre6">9.5. THE PURPOSE OF ACTS</a></p>
<p class="pf">Numerous proposals for the purpose of Acts have been defended in recent study, including the following: (1) Acts is a defense of the Christian church to Rome or (2) of Rome to the Christian church or (3) of Paul against those who have sided against Paul’s notion that Christianity is the true successor to Judaism; (4) Acts is a work of edification designed to provide an eschatological corrective for a church in crisis; (5) it was written to reassure believers struggling with the reliability of the Christian message — with regard to either its truth and relevance or its firm foundation in the story of God’s people; (6) Acts was intended to assist the Christian <a id="pg266" class="calibre3"></a>movement in its attempts to legitimate itself over against Judaism; and (7) Acts was written to encourage among Christians a fundamental allegiance to Jesus calling for a basic social and political stance within the empire.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Because of the narrative unity of Luke-Acts, some of these can be excluded from the outset — namely, those centering on aims particular to Acts or Paul (options 1–3) — since these do not account for the whole of the Lukan narrative. But this does not mean that we should immediately deny that Luke may have had concerns such as these. The Evangelist may have been motivated by multiple aims that might not concern Luke-Acts as a whole. At the same time, as we recognize more and more both the ways in which Luke has portrayed the lordship of Jesus over against that of the Roman emperor and the ways in which the empire has positioned itself against the Christian movement in the latter half of Acts, it becomes increasingly difficult to believe that Luke’s primary concern was to encourage from either direction good relations between church and Rome.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We have already seen that the genre of Acts suggests Luke’s concern with legitimization and apologetic, and our discussion of the aim of Luke-Acts highlighted the centrality of God’s purpose to bring salvation to all (see <a href="part0010.html#ch06" class="calibre3">chapter 6</a> above). In the conflicted Mediterranean world of the first century, not least the larger Jewish world, it is not difficult to imagine how this understanding of God’s purpose and its embodiment in the Christian movement would have been the source of controversy and uncertainty. How could the Christian message, with its emphases on the exaltation of a crucified man and on the inclusion of Gentiles within the historic people of God, attract such heightened opposition from Jewish leadership <em class="calibre5">and</em> be a faithful accounting of God’s work in the world? Against this backdrop, the purpose of (Luke-)Acts becomes more clear: to strengthen the Christian movement in the face of opposition by (1) confirming Christians in their interpretation and experience of the redemptive purpose of God and by (2) calling them to continued faithfulness and witness in God’s salvific project. The purpose of Luke-Acts, then, is primarily ecclesiological, focused on the invitation to participate faithfully as God’s people in God’s redemptive purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Crucial to this construal of Luke’s agenda is his treatment of Judaism. Acts as a whole insists on the continuity between Judaism and Christianity, but it does so in a peculiar way. On the one hand, the use of Scripture, the general portrayal of the Jewish ethos of the Christian movement, and the unrelenting picture of Jesus’ followers as persons who saw themselves as kin to the Jewish people all suggest the important degree to which Acts narrates the continuity of the Christian community with the ancient people of God. On the other, it is everywhere evident that Luke is interested in an “interpreted Judaism.” That is, Judaism — its institutions, its practices, and so on — are to be embraced fully only when understood faithfully with respect to God’s redemptive purpose. But in order to be understood thus, Israel’s religion must cohere with the purpose of God as this is articulated by <a id="pg267" class="calibre3"></a>God’s own authorized spokespersons. Who speaks for God? First and foremost, God’s interpretive agent is his Son, Jesus of Nazareth. In Acts, this role is fulfilled by “witnesses,” empowered by the Holy Spirit to continue the witness of Jesus. Luke’s presentation suggests, then, the nature of a fundamental struggle between followers of “the Way” and other forms of Judaism. This is a struggle that goes to the very heart of Jewish faith, embracing sometimes competing understandings of <a id="pg268" class="calibre3"></a>Israel’s God and of the meaning of the Scriptures of Israel. It is a struggle of interpretation that is so important and so basic to the identity of God’s people that Jesus’ followers should not be surprised when they find themselves confronted with opposition. Instead, hostility should be viewed as the arena in which they might renew their fundamental allegiance toward the plan of God manifest in Jesus as they stand firm in their witness among Jews and Gentiles alike.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sbh">The Text of Acts</p>
<p class="sbaft">For serious study of the Greek text, Acts presents a special quandary because of the existence of two primary textual types, the Alexandrian and the Western (the latter especially represented by Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis). The book of Acts in the Western tradition is almost ten percent longer than the Alexandrian, and the character of each of these two textual types is quite distinctive. The essential question is, Whence the Western text? Does the Western text bear witness to an ongoing process of emendation? Can the Western text be traced back to the hand of the Evangelist himself? Or does it display a mixture of more or less original and secondary readings that must be considered on a case-by-case basis?</p>
<p class="sb">As early as the late seventeenth century it was suggested that Luke was responsible for two versions of Acts and that this explains the existence of the two major text types. This view has gained new momentum since the onset of redaction criticism in the twentieth century, when it was found that the Western text sometimes displayed Lukan style and theological preferences. In spite of theories of this nature, most scholars contend that the witnesses of the so-called Western tradition do not contain something approximating the original text of Acts and deny that with the Western tradition we have access to a revision, primary or secondary, from the hand of Luke the Evangelist. Most assume that, while the Western text has no claim to originality, it may contain superior readings at some points.</p>
<p class="sbl">Although today there remains little certainty on the nature of the original text of Acts, then, it remains true that most study of Acts continues to proceed on the basis of the relative superiority of the Alexandrian text type. In some cases, the Western text type is altogether neglected, on the supposition that it represents a deliberate and sustained revision of the book of Acts; in others Western-type readings are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</div>
<p class="ah" id="ch09ah06"><a href="part0002.html#rch09ah06" class="calibre6">9.6. THE AUTHORSHIP OF ACTS</a></p>
<p class="pf">As with the NT Gospels, the author of the book of Acts is anonymous. It is generally assumed that the Gospel of Luke and Acts were written by the same person (compare, e.g., Luke 1:1–4 and Acts 1:1–2), and early traditions identify this person as Luke. The oldest Greek manuscript of the Gospel, Papyrus Bodmer XIV, dating from about 200 <small class="calibre9">CE</small>, uses the title “Gospel according to Luke.” The Muratorian Canon, from the late second century, also identifies Luke, a physician and companion of Paul, as the Gospel’s author — an identification also found in the second-century writings of Irenaeus (<em class="calibre5">Adv. Haer.</em> 3.1.1; 3.14.1) and in later writings (e.g., Eusebius, <em class="calibre5">Hist. Eccl.</em> 3.4.1–7; 3.24.14–15; 5.8.3; 6.25.6). Until recently, the view that Luke-Acts was authored by a companion of Paul drew additional support from the so-called we-passages in Acts (16:10–17; 20:5–21:18; chs. 27–28). Some now regard these passages as literary creations. At the very least, the author’s self-conscious inclusion of himself in the narrative in the latter half of Acts raises the question of authorship for Acts in a way that is not so important for the Gospel of Luke.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Interestingly, however, the “we-passages” do nothing to alter the initial anonymity of the author of Acts. Even when involved in first-person narration, the narrator of Acts identifies himself not as an individual with a name, but as one of a group. He may at times be present as a participant-observer, but his focus is not on his individual identity. Rather, the “we” of his narration contributes to the vividness of his account and invites his audience to read themselves into the narrative. That first-person narration comes in only selected portions of the account underscores that the narrator makes no claim to being a constant companion of Paul and his circle. This speaks against the tradition that Luke and Paul were “inseparable” (Irenaeus, <em class="calibre5">Adv. Haer.</em> 3.1.1, 4), but also against those who deny that Luke could have written Acts because the author of Acts could not have been a regular companion of Paul. It also suggests that first-person narration is more than a literary device calculated to enliven the narrative.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The name “Luke” appears three times in the NT — Col 4:14; Phlm 24; and 2 Tim 4:11 — all evidently with reference to the same person, a companion of Paul. This Luke is traditionally identified as the author of the Gospel of Luke and <a id="pg269" class="calibre3"></a>the Acts of the Apostles. The reference in 2 Timothy has little to offer about Luke himself beyond highlighting his faithfulness in comparison with others who are said to have deserted Paul. In Philemon, Luke is identified as a “fellow worker,” a term that designates not simply one of Paul’s “traveling companions” or “assistants” but a person of comparable stature to Paul himself, a “missionary colleague.” Colossians refers to Luke as “beloved physician.” This suggests that his knowledge and skills as a healer had won him respect, placing him in the company of those physicians, known in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, who enjoyed high status as students of medicine and philosophy. Because Col 4:10–11 refers to Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus as the only Jews present among Paul’s coworkers, it emerges that Luke is a Gentile or at least a non-Jewish Semite. Some who see evidence in Luke-Acts of an author with a notable Jewish background debate this last point. The scriptural intimacy and Jewish interests manifest in Luke-Acts do not require a hypothesis of Jewish authorship, however, but are equally compatible with significant exposure to Judaism by a non-Jew.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Little reason remains, then, not to accept the traditional identification of Luke as the author of Luke-Acts. This would make Luke the most prolific writer in the NT, with some 28% of the NT attributed to him. If Lukan authorship of these NT books is accepted, additional information becomes available from their language and style — for example, that Luke was educated, probably urban, with firsthand exposure to rhetorical training and to Israel’s Scriptures, that he wrote from the social location of those who traffic in technical or professional writing, and that he was one of the “people of the Way,” a “Christian,” either second- or third-generation (see Luke 1:1–4).</p>
