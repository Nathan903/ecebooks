				<p class="text">This book is a Christian theological essay on holiness. It is not primarily concerned with matters of ascetical or pastoral theology, though it has an eye to the implications of theological talk of holiness for the practice of the Christian life. Rather, it is written from a particular standpoint, and tries both to articulate some convictions about the substance of the Christian faith, and to set out some judgements about the nature, setting and tasks of Christian theology. At heart, what is offered here is a small exercise in dogmatic theology, a <span class="italic">trinitarian dogmatics of holiness</span>. Both parts of that designation – ‘dogmatics’ and ‘trinitarian’ – require a little more scrutiny as we approach the task which lies ahead of us.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">First, what follows is a piece of Christian <span class="italic">dogmatic</span> theology. Theology is an office in the Church of Jesus Christ. It is properly undertaken in the sphere of the Church, that is, in the region of human fellowship which is brought into being and sustained by the saving activity and presence of God. Theology is one of the effects of that saving presence; it is one of the activities of reason transfigured by the renewal of human life and history which the holy God effects in his works and makes manifest in his word. The divine works of renewal culminate in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, his exaltation over all things, and his bestowal of new life in the Spirit’s power. Through the Spirit, Jesus Christ the exalted one generates a new mode of common human life, the life of the Church. To participate in that common human life, hearing the gospel in fellowship under the word of God and living together under the signs of baptism and the Lord’s supper, is to exist in a sphere in which God’s limitless power is unleashed and extends into the entirety of human life: moral, political, cultural, affective, intellectual. Reason, like everything else, is remade in the sphere of the Church; and theological reason is an activity of the regenerate mind turned towards the gospel of Jesus Christ, which constitutes the Church’s origin and vocation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Theology is an office in the Church. When Church and theology are shaped into holiness by the gospel, then the work of theology is one to which the theologian is called and appointed and for which the theologian is equipped, in order to undertake a particular task. Theology is not free thought or speech, if by ‘free’ we mean unattached to any given set of objects or any given sphere of inquiry. Theology is not free speech but holy speech. It is set apart for and bound to its object – that is, the gospel – and to the fellowship of the saints in which the gospel is heard as divine judgement and consolation–that is, the Church. Only as it does its work under the tutelage, authority and protection of the Church is theology free. ‘Church’, of course, is to be understood spiritually and not merely naturally, as the domain in which common human life is sanctified by the Holy Spirit and made into the communion of the saints. Theology is under the Church’s tutelage because it can only fulfil its office if it is instructed by immersing itself in the intellectual and spiritual practices of the<span class="italic"> sanctorum communio</span> in all their variety. Theology is under the Church’s authority because it is a ‘positive’ science, a mode of reasoned inquiry which has been given a definite matter, apprehended in the Church of Jesus Christ in which he makes himself known. The self-giving presence of Christ in the Church is the law of theology, the reality which governs theological reason. Theology is thus under the authority of the Church because the Church in its turn is under the wholly legitimate and quickening authority of the truth of the gospel. And theology is under the Church’s protection because what safeguards theology’s truthfulness is not the exercise of critical scruple but the fear of the one who is the Church’s Lord.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What is the task of theology so described? When it is not overtaken by arbitrariness or self-confidence or scepticism about its object, theology takes its part in the work of edifying the Church. It does not do this by its own unaided powers, but by bearing witness to the risen Christ who speaks his word. Through the Spirit Christ announces his life-giving presence, nourishes the Church and makes it grow up into himself. The particular task of theology is to attest the truth of the gospel in the wake of Christ’s own self-attestation. Theology edifies by testifying to the gospel as promise and claim. In the Church’s theological work, the gospel is articulated as the norm of the Church’s praise, confession and action, and the ground of the Church’s understanding of nature and human history. As it seeks to articulate the gospel in the<span class="italic"> sanctorum communio</span>, theology concentrates on two fundamental tasks, namely exegesis and dogmatics. Exegesis is of supremely critical importance, because the chief instrument through which Christ publishes the gospel is Holy Scripture. Exegesis is the attempt to hear what the Spirit says to the Churches; without it, theology cannot even begin to discharge its office. Dogmatics is complementary but strictly subordinate to the exegetical task. It is not an improvement upon Holy Scripture, replacing the informal, occasional language of Scripture by conceptual forms which are better organized, more sophisticated or more firmly grounded. Rather, dogmatics seeks simply to produce a set of flexible accounts of the essential content of the gospel as it is found in Holy Scripture, with the aim of informing, guiding and correcting the Church’s reading. Dogmatics attempts a ‘reading’ of the gospel which in its turn assists the Church’s reading. Developing such a ‘reading’ of the gospel entails, of course, the development (or annexation) of conceptual vocabularies and forms of argument whose range and sophistication may seem distant from the more immediate, urgent idioms of Scripture. But though technical sophistication is not without its attendant perils, it is only vicious when allowed to drift free from the proper end of theology, which is the saints’ edification. When that end is kept in view and allowed to govern the work of theology, then dogmatics can be pursued as a modest work of holy reason, transparent to the gospel and doing its service in the Church as the school of Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The account of holiness which is offered here is a worked example of this understanding of the task of Christian theology in its ecclesial setting. Such an understanding of theology enjoys rather little contemporary prestige, and is commonly judged to be naive, assertive, authoritarian, above all, closed. A good deal of contemporary systematic or dogmatic theology tends, by contrast, to be conversational or comparativist in approach. ‘Conversational’ theologies (an earlier generation might have called them ‘correlational’) construct Christian theology by drawing on a wide range of cultural, philosophical and religious sources to build up an account of the Christian faith through elaborating the associations and interrogations which occur as Christianity talks to others. ‘Comparativist’ theologies seek to identify common themes in the religions of the world and interpret them as manifestations of a single source of ultimate value. Both believe that only by resisting the confessional and the positive can Christian theology secure opportunities to make a contribution to the public realm. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">By contrast, the kind of theology attempted here is less sanguine about the prospects for such exchanges. It more naturally thinks of its host culture, not as Athens, but as Babylon. It is acutely conscious of the menace of wickedness in the life of the mind. And it is intensive before it is extensive. That is, its work is focused upon a quite restricted range of texts (the biblical canon) as they have been read and struggled with in the complex though unified reality which we call the tradition of the Church. Yet although it is intensive in this way, it is not stable or settled. The persistence with which it returns to its singular theme is an attempt to face the reality of the gospel as a permanent source of unsettlement, discomfiture and renewal of vocation. The intensity of this kind of theology is not the internally-directed energy of an achieved, separated world of ideas, but that of a way of thinking which might be called eschatological – always, that is, emerging from its own dissolution and reconstitution by the presence of the holy God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What, second, is involved in a <span class="italic">trinitarian</span> dogmatics of holiness? Put at its simplest, a trinitarian account of holiness makes two related claims. The first concerns the doctrine of God proper, namely that God is holy as Father, Son and Spirit. Second, the triune God is the Holy One <span class="italic">in our midst</span>; his holiness is a mode of relation to the creatures whom he sanctifies and calls to holiness. A dogmatic account of holiness is thus not simply concerned to offer an account of immanent divine properties; nor is it an elaboration of a spirituality or ethics of human sanctification. Rather, its concern is with the path taken by the holy three-in-one who, in the majestic fulfilment of his own freedom, elects, reconciles and perfects the creature for holy obedience. Accordingly, it does not think of divine holiness in abstraction from the sanctifying acts of God <span class="italic">pro nobis</span>, nor of human sanctity in isolation from election, salvation and the work of the sanctifying Spirit. This is the difference which the Christian doctrine of the Trinity makes in a theological account of holiness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Although the chapters which follow are all shaped by trinitarian affirmations, there is much that they do not attempt to do. They presume, rather than defend, the view that the Christian doctrine of God is the doctrine of the Trinity; and they do not offer any treatment of the primary concepts of trinitarian theology, such as person, unity, procession, mission, and the like. Nor do they give any extended account of general questions of what is involved in predicating of God a property such as holiness. Though the book has implications for such questions, my concern here is a good deal more restricted; I try to show how a trinitarian account of God’s holiness contains within it a particular way of thinking of God’s relation to and action upon creatures, one which refuses both their radical separation and their confusion. Barth (somewhat bizarrely considered by many to be a reluctant trinitarian) puts the matter thus:</p>
				<p class="quote">Trinitarian thinking compels theology … to be completely in earnest about the thought of God in at least two places: first, at the point where it is a question of God’s action in regard to man, and, secondly, at the point where it is a question of man’s action in regard to God. It is aware of God as the Word of the Father which is spoken to man and as the Spirit of the Father and of the Word which enables man to hear the Word. It cannot seek to have merely one centre, one subject, just because its subject is God. To the extent that it sought to resolve itself into a mere teaching of God’s action in regard to man, into a pure teaching of the Word, it would become metaphysics. And to the extent that it sought to resolve itself into a teaching of man’s action in regard to God, into a pure teaching of the Spirit, it would become mysticism. The one, however, would be just as little a pure teaching of the Word of God, as the other would be a pure teaching of the Spirit of God. A pure teaching of the Word will take into account the Holy Spirit as the divine reality in which the Word is heard, just as a pure teaching of the Spirit of the Son will take into account the Word of God as the divine reality in which the Word is given to us. It was with this thought in mind that the Reformers propagated the teaching of the Word of God in its correlation with faith as the work of the Holy Sprit in man.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-1" id="footnote-265-1-backlink">1</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">A Christian dogmatics of holiness is not metaphysics, because the holy God, reaching out into the world in Son and Spirit, is the sanctifier; nor is it mysticism (or moralism), because human reality is holy only in dependence upon the Spirit of the Son who makes holy. Thus, as Barth puts it, a trinitarian dogmatics of holiness ‘cannot seek to have merely one centre, one subject’ <span class="italic">precisely because</span> ‘its subject is God’ – God known as holy in the incarnate Word and the life-giving Spirit. And so the account of the holiness of the triune God as fellowship-creating holiness in Chapter 2 is followed in Chapter 3 by an account of the holiness of the Church and in Chapter 4 by a sketch of the individual Christian’s sanctification: only in such a way can we trace to its end the trajectory of the work of the triune God. As we approach that task, however, we must first pause to consider what it means to speak of the holiness of theology.</p>
