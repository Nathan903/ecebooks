				<p class="text">In the preceding chapters, I have tried to articulate and defend two basic proposals, one about the way in which Christian theology goes about the task of giving an account of holiness, and another about the material content of such an account. The first proposal was that a dogmatics of holiness is itself an exercise of holiness. Christian theological thinking, if it is to take place in the midst of the common life of the saints of God, is not transcendent critical inquiry but an attempt at rational speech about the Holy One. A Christian theology of holiness is an exercise of holy reason, and holy reason is reason segregated by God so that God’s communicative presence as Father, Son and Spirit can be known and loved. Both the context and the content of what Christian theology has to say about holiness derive from revelation (the gift of God’s presence as the Holy One); and so such a theology is not poetic but positive, not an activity of naming but one of confessing. It finds its content, its norm and its limit in Holy Scripture as the inspired creaturely instrument through which the Holy One announces himself. Accordingly, its primary task is exegetical rather than comparative or phenomenological. It tries as best it can to read the canon as a witness to God’s self-promulgation, and is unpersuaded that much is to be gained from reading the canon as an expression of the experience of the holy-in-general. Such an account, I suggest, cannot be the work of unaided reason, for reason, too, is caught up in the history of holiness; reason is part of the history of wickedness and the overcoming of wickedness by the reconciling and sanctifying works of God. Thus as ‘holy reason’, Christian theology will properly display the traces of mortification and vivification, as it is reproved for its vanity and love of falsehood and remade by the Spirit for humble attention to truth. Its fundamental posture will thus be prayerful; and its place will be in the fellowship of the saints, serving the community’s confession of the triune God, the fearing and sanctifying of God’s name.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The second proposal made in the course of the preceding discussions concerned the content of a Christian theology of holiness. That content was set out by exploring three inseparable themes: the holiness which is proper to the Holy Trinity; the holiness of the Church; and the holiness of the individual Christian. The inseparability of these themes derives from the inner structure of Christian beliefs about God’s trinitarian holiness. As Father, Son and Spirit, God’s holiness is a way of indicating the ‘name’ and ‘works’ of God, that is, the identity which God enacts. Like all talk of God’s attributes, talk of God’s holiness is a conceptual attempt to point to the concreteness of God’s identity. That concrete identity is ‘enacted’ in the sense that it is accomplished in God’s free action towards his creatures as creator, reconciler and perfecter. Holiness is thus God’s personal moral relation to his creatures. The triune Holy One is the one who establishes fellowship: as Father willing and forming the creature for fellowship, as Son defending that fellowship against the offensive of sin, and as Spirit bringing that fellowship to its human completion. Holiness as a mode of relation can be explored at two levels; the ecclesial and the individual. Ecclesial holiness is grounded in the work of the Holy Trinity in electing, redeeming and consummating a holy people who are the covenant partners of God and the fellowship of the saints. The Church’s holiness is thus always an alien sanctity: gift, not possession; grace, not achievement. It is, moreover, visible in the primary act of the Church, which is confession – that is, acknowledgement or recognition of the sheer majesty, transcendent worth and goodness of God. Holiness is not selfachieved perfection but a pointing to the perfect reality of the holy God. Its primary forms are hearing the command and promise of the gospel, confession of sin in penitence and faith, testimony before the world, and prayer for the hallowing of God’s name. At the level of individual sanctification, holiness is the creature’s renewal by the work of the Holy Trinity, in which the creature is emancipated for the active life of fellowship with God. Through sanctification, the creature is reintegrated into the movement of God’s history with us. All holy activity flows from faith; but faith is active in the baptismal pattern of dying and rising with Christ, that is, in mortification and vivification, through which holiness is shaped as freedom, obedience and love.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Such thoughts, lovely though they would have been for many in the Christian past, are scarcely conceivable in our culture. Unlike, for example, tolerance, holiness is not esteemed a civic virtue, and strikes us as inhumane. That is not because it is inhumane; quite the opposite: for the Christian confession, holiness is ingredient within human flourishing. If the opposite seems to be the case, it is in part because understanding holiness and engaging in its practices require the conversion of our conception of humanity. What might be involved in that conversion? </p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">We are schooled by our culture to organize our sense of our own identities in a <span class="italic">reflexive</span> way. That is to say, we are less likely to receive our primary self-understanding from given localities, traditions and roles, and more likely to act in ways whose manner and goal is self-construction. Lacking by and large any deep vocabulary of natures and ends in both our politics and our moral psychology, we gravitate by instinct towards voluntarism, though it is a voluntarism of a particular variety. It is (at least in the high modern West) not so much a voluntarism of rebellion, but rather one of consumption and style. In the Kantian and Marxist forms which exercised such a powerful force in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the voluntarism of rebellion retained a sense that to be human was to be a certain kind of being, one with a specific destiny – the project of liberation. The voluntarism of consumption and style differs from this in two crucial respects. It lacks that sense of the identity and durability of the human which is articulated in talk of human ‘nature’, preferring a much more differential or revisable account of what it means to be human. And it is largely non-teleological; such ends as we may set for ourselves are local, transient, and not a movement towards the perfection of our natures, for we have none to perfect. Consider, for example, the following passage from the second volume of Foucault’s <span class="italic">History of Sexuality</span>:</p>
				<p class="quote">[F]or an action to be ‘moral,’ it must not be reducible to an act or series of acts conforming to a rule, a law, or a value. Of course all moral action involves a relationship with the reality in which it is carried out, and a relationship with the self. The latter is not simply ‘self-awareness’ but self-formation as an ‘ethical subject’, a process in which the individual delimits what part of himself will form the object of his moral practice, defines his position relative to the precept he will follow, and decides on a certain mode of being that will serve as his moral goal. And this requires him to act upon himself, to monitor, test, improve, and transform himself. There is no specific moral action that does not refer to a unified moral conduct; no moral conduct that does not call for the forming of oneself as an ethical subject; and no forming of the ethical subject without ‘modes of subjectivation’ and an ‘ascetics’ or ‘practices of the self ’ that support them.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-83" id="footnote-265-83-backlink">1</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Foucault’s concern here is not simply the characteristically modern worry that conformity to external norms does not secure moral authenticity. It is much more that being an ethical subject is a matter of self-formation. Morality is a practice of the self, ‘what might be called “the determination of ethical substance”; that is, the way in which the individual has to constitute this or that part of himself as the prime material of his moral conduct’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-84" id="footnote-265-84-backlink">2</a></span> It is that ‘<span class="italic">ethical work</span> that one performs on oneself … to attempt to transform oneself into the ethical subject of one’s behaviour’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-85" id="footnote-265-85-backlink">3</a></span> This collapse of morality into self-stylization (what Foucault calls ‘ascetics’) not only entails the most severe contraction of moral ontology; it also makes acutely difficult any conception of moral obligation, for behind style lies <span class="italic">will</span>, unattached, and, without ends, unchastened. </p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Again, consider Anthony Giddens’ definition of ‘life politics’ in <span class="italic">Modernity and Self-Identity</span>:</p>
				<p class="quote">Life politics presumes (a certain level of ) emancipation … : emancipation from the fixities of tradition and from the conditions of hierarchical domination … Life politics does not primarily concern the conditions which liberate us in order to make choices: it is a politics <span class="italic">of</span> choice. While emancipatory politics is a politics of life chances, life politics is a politics of lifestyle. Life politics is the politics of a reflexively mobilised order – the system of late modernity – which, on an individual and collective level, has radically altered the parameters of social activity. It is a politics of self-actualisation in a reflexively ordered environment, where that reflexivity links self and body to systems of global scope. In this arena of activity, power is generative rather than hierarchical. Life politics is lifestyle politics in the serious and rich sense.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-86" id="footnote-265-86-backlink">4</a></span> </p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Giddens’ language is less drastically internal, more public, than that of Foucault; but the underlying vision of selfhood organized around choice, the centrality of style, and the inconsequential status of nature as a domain external to the self’s manipulation, remain much the same. There is no nature and no historical course other than those cast up in the processes of ‘the reflexive project of the self ’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-87" id="footnote-265-87-backlink">5</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">With such construals of human identity, a Christian theology of holiness is simply incommensurable. According to the Christian confession, the space in which human living is undertaken is created and reconciled space which is on the way to its final perfection. Created and recreated by God and ordered by God’s providential presence, it is a given space with a given historical trajectory. In that spatial and temporal domain, human work is the work of beings whose self-definition is not their own project but a responsible endeavour truthfully and faithfully to live out the calling of the Holy One. Responsibility does not mean the end of all human mobility or plasticity, for it is characteristic of the kind of creature that we are that we discover our identity by fulfilling a vocation through time; we <span class="italic">become</span> holy. But the becoming is, precisely, discovery, not invention; it is not our generation of a self-narrative, not life politics or an ascetics (aesthetics) of the self, but the enactment of an office: ‘You shall be holy, for I, the Lord your God, am holy.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Such affirmations about human life in the domain and history of holiness appear deeply traditionalist and therefore essentialist, as indeed in certain respects they are; a culture which aspires to be detraditionalized and to repudiate essences may have little taste for them. But it should not be overlooked that the history of holiness is not simply regular, consistent and steady; it is an eschatological history, generated by baptism, and its ontology is organized around the advent of newness. It is the baptized, not the devotees of ‘secular risk culture’,<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-88" id="footnote-265-88-backlink">6</a></span> who ought to be familiar with their own dissolution, and therefore with their remaking.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Persuading our culture that holiness is of paramount importance for its well-being will require not only the culture’s conversion, but also the continual conversion of the Church to the gospel of holiness. A crucial aspect of holiness is an increase in <span class="italic">concentration</span>: the focusing of mind, will and affections on the holy God and his ways with us. This book has been an attempt at such concentration. Promoting concentration is not the work of theology, however, but of God, and so it is a matter for prayer. At the end of one of the lectures which Calvin gave on Ezekiel in 1563–4, the last lectures he was to give, he prayed thus:</p>
				<p class="quote">Almighty God, in your limitless goodness you have deemed us worthy of such an honour that you descended to earth in the person of your only-begotten Son, and each day appear to us intimately in your gospel where we contemplate your living image. Therefore grant that we may not abuse such a benefit through senseless curiosity but be truly transformed into your glory, and thus more and more advance in the renewal of our minds and entire life, so that at last we may be gathered into that blessed and eternal glory which has been obtained for us through your only-begotten Son, our Lord. Amen.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-89" id="footnote-265-89-backlink">7</a></span></p>
