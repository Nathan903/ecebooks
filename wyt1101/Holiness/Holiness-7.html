				<p class="a-head">I</p>
				<p class="text">The previous chapter sketched an account of a trinitarian dogmatics of the holiness of God. Central to the account was the claim that God’s holiness is a mode of his relation to his creation: the holiness of the Holy Trinity is made known as God speaks his holy name and, in majestic freedom, accomplishes his work as creator, reconciler and perfecter. Holiness is one of the ways of characterizing the covenant-creating and covenantsustaining presence of the glorious three-in-one. Because of this – because holiness is known in God’s movement towards us as the creative Father, as the reconciling Son who is for us even when in his righteousness he is opposed to our sin, and as the consecrating Spirit – an account of the holiness of God is incomplete without attention to the creatures before whom God is sanctifyingly present. It is a fundamental rule of Christian theology that a doctrine of God which is <span class="italic">only</span> a doctrine of God is not a Christian doctrine of God. The task of articulating a Christian doctrine of God, because it is a doctrine of the Holy Trinity made known in free majesty in the economy of creation, reconciliation and perfection, is not finished when it has spoken of God in himself (<span class="italic">in se</span>); for God is essentially, to the depths of his triune being, God for us and God with us, the one whose mercy evokes the miracle of human fellowship with himself. There is always a double theme in Christian theology, a twofoldness in all its matter which corresponds to the identity of aseity and self-giving in the life of the Holy Trinity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In terms of giving a dogmatic account of the holiness of God, this means that to the treatment of God’s holiness there necessarily belongs a treatment of the holiness of the saints, that is, the holiness of the Church as the<span class="italic"> sanctorum communio</span>, and the holiness of the individual Christian, who is a ‘saint in Christ Jesus’ (Phil. 4.21). The next two chapters will be given over to a description of this theme, looking first at the Church as the communion of saints and then at the believer’s life of sanctification.</p>
				<p class="a-head">II</p>
				<p class="text">To begin with, however, we need to ask a question which, at first glance, seems purely formal or procedural, but which in fact takes us quickly to the heart of some central substantive issues. The question is this: How do we move from the doctrine of God to the doctrine of the Church? In what precise way are theology proper and ecclesiology to be related? That there is, indeed, such a relation, and that it is constitutive for theological talk about the nature of the Church, is the burden of a good deal of recent trinitarian theology, especially those styles of social trinitarian thought which emphasize that the Holy Trinity is to be conceived as a society of persons not only constituted by their personal relations but overflowing in gracious relation to the human community of the Church. The resourcefulness of social trinitarianism for our understanding of human common life, both politically and in the Church, has been a matter of much emphasis. The relatedness of Father, Son and Spirit is canvassed as the ground or model for the Church, and the Church is thereby conceived as the realization in time of the human vocation to society, and so as the social extension of reconciliation through its gracious participation in the triune life of God. Much might be said in response to this aspect of social trinitarian theologies, but for our purposes two initial hesitations might be recorded.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The first is that such accounts of the life of the Church as a participation in or image of the relatedness of God characteristically give insufficient attention to the free majesty of God. The gracious or miraculous character of the Church, its sheer difference over against the perfect work of God which brings it into being, is often in some measure compromised by the easy, unproblematic way in which the language of participation is often deployed. The Hegelian cast of much modern ecclesiology is very much in evidence, and meets little resistance from those who interleave ecclesiology and the doctrine of God. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">A second, related, hesitation concerns the way in which such accounts of the Church’s relation to the triune life of God betray a drift into divine immanence. This can be seen in the way in which such ecclesiologies characteristically stress the continuity between the action of God and the action of the Church, in a manner which can easily jeopardize our sense of the freedom and perfection of God’s work. Such ecclesiologies can place excessive emphasis upon the Church as agent, and, correspondingly, underplay the passivity which is at the heart of the Church as a creature of divine grace. For if the being of the Church is a participation in the life of the triune divine society, then it is in the work of the Church that the work of the triune God finds its realization and, in an important sense, its continuation. In effect, this constitutes an orientation in ecclesiology that makes the work of the Church an actualization of or sharing in the divine presence and action, rather than a testimony to that presence and action. In short: the repeated <span class="italic">hapax</span> (‘once’) of Heb. 9.26–28 – the uniqueness, the utter fullness, perfection and sufficiency of the work of Father, Son and Spirit – is to some degree endangered when the Church is considered to enter into the movement of the divine work. One result of this is that the holiness of the Church is no longer sheerly alien, no longer the result of the Word’s declaration, but in some sense infused into the Church by the Church’s <span class="italic">koinonia</span> with God, its perichoretic relation to the Holy Trinity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The account that I want to offer here of the relation between the doctrine of the Trinity and the doctrine of the Church’s holiness is of a quite different complexion. Above all, this is because it makes the miracle of election central to the Church’s existence and nature. Where the social trinitarian language of participation emphasizes the continuity, even coinherence, of divine and ecclesial action, the language of election draws attention to the way in which the Church has its being in the ever-fresh work of divine grace. The Church is what it is in the ceaseless gift of its being through the risen Christ and the Holy Spirit who accomplish the will of the Father in gathering a holy people to himself. Only thus, I want to suggest, can we retain the wisdom of speaking of the Church’s sanctity as an <span class="italic">alien</span> sanctity, a nonpossessable holiness. However, a caution needs to be entered lest, in countering the Hegelian tendencies of social trinitarian ecclesiologies, we overreact and bifurcate God and the Church. It is, doubtless, true that the alien character of the Church – its sheer difference from God – can be so stressed that the ecclesiology which results is spiritualized and dualist: spiritualized, in the sense that we lose sight of the Church as human historical society, dualist in the sense that it polarizes God and the human community and renders God as a purely transcendent reality, unrelated to human social space and time. The counter to those dangers, however, is not to erode the distinction between God and the human historical reality of the Church – to deal with the dangers in that way would not be to solve, but simply to repeat, the problem. Rather, the most effective counter is to offer a disciplined theological description of the nature and acts of the holy Church: that is, to govern our thinking in this matter by the gospel. Gospel discipline will require us to say both that the Church’s holiness is real and actual, a perceptible form of common human being and action, and also that the being and action of the Church are holy only in so far as they have within themselves a primary reference to the work and word of the holy God. The Church is holy; but it is holy, not by virtue of some ontological participation in the divine holiness, but by virtue of its calling by God, its reception of the divine benefits, and its obedience of faith. Like its unity, its catholicity and its apostolicity, the Church’s holiness is that which it is by virtue of its sheer contingency upon the mercy of God.</p>
				<p class="a-head">III</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">To expand on this in more detail we discuss, first, the <span class="italic">grounds</span> of the Church’s holiness. In propositional form:</p>
				<p class="quote"><span class="italic">The holiness of the Church is grounded in the work of the Holy Trinity in electing, reconciling and perfecting a people to become God’s covenant partners and the fellowship of the saints.</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">What is meant here?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is a Church. Within the ambiguous kingdom of human time and society there exists an assembly, a congregation of men and women who constitute the covenant people and the fellowship of the saints. Their common life is the sign that there is, indeed, a human response to the divine call; to the divine selfutterance – ‘I shall be your God’ – there really does correspond a human reality, the gathering of God’s people. But the existence of such a gathering is wholly astonishing. It is grounded in no human possibility; indeed, from the side of human history it is nothing other than a sheer impossibility, for the commonwealth of human time lies under the sway of sin and alienation, striving with all its might to oppose God and to refuse his call to reconciliation. Apart from God, human history is populated by that bleak, estranged and ruined company called ‘no people’ (1 Pet. 2.10: <span class="italic">ou laos</span>; cf. Hos. 2.23). But ingredient within the gospel confession is the claim that there now exists the extraordinary fact of <span class="italic">laos theou</span>, people of God. There is a form of common human life which can only be described as a holy nation, a people for God’s possession (1 Pet. 2.9). That such a holy people exists and is preserved through time, that it does not collapse back into alienation and hatred, that here sin is held in check and not permitted to eat away at human fellowship – all this lies in the hands of the holy God alone.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Put in more formal dogmatic terms: all talk of the Church’s holiness is rooted in talk of the holiness of God. He, the holy three-in-one, what he is and what he does, is the ground of the Church’s existence and of its endurance. Language about God is to be <span class="italic">operative</span> language in talking of the grounds of the holiness of the Church: in giving an account of the entirety of its history and of all its activity, including its holiness, this language about God is of critical significance. God is not merely the Church’s initial cause nor its remote end; rather, the Church is because God is. The Church is holy because God is holy. And therefore the <span class="italic">sanctitas ecclesiae</span> is at heart <span class="italic">sanctitas passiva</span>, a matter of faith’s trustful reliance upon and reference to the work of the triune God:</p>
				<p class="quote">In respect of its holiness the community is bound to [Christ] … only to the extent that He constantly wills to bind Himself and does in fact bind Himself to it. He is always the Subject, the Lord, the Giver of the holiness of its action. Its action as such can only be a seeking, an asking after holiness, a prayer for it.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-51" id="footnote-265-51-backlink">1</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Why, we might ask, is it that the <span class="italic">triune</span> God is the ground of the Church’s holiness? For an answer, we might pause a little to look at the elaboration of this point in that magisterial declaration of proto-trinitarian theology, the letter to the Ephesians.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-52" id="footnote-265-52-backlink">2</a></span> There, the holiness of the Church is grounded, first, in the electing activity of the Father. ‘Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing … , even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him’ (Eph. 1.3–4). Viewed in the context of the overall scope of the first chapter of the letter, this statement in these early verses can be seen as conveying a double affirmation: that the ground of holiness is election, and that the goal of election is holiness. If there exists a human realm of holiness, if holiness has an enduring human and social form, then that form is to be traced to its generative source in the electing activity of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, condensed into the single word: <span class="italic">exelexato </span>– he chose. But alongside this: if there is an election of grace, then it is no mere self-enclosed divine movement, but a moving power in human history, that which has as its <span class="italic">telos</span> the recreation of a holy people of God, bound to him as the echo of and testimony to his own proper holiness. Election and sanctification, in other words, are inseparably linked.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-53" id="footnote-265-53-backlink">3</a></span> As Calvin puts it: ‘God’s eternal election is the foundation and first cause both of our calling and of all the benefits which we have received from God … holiness, innocence, and every virtue in men, are the fruit of election … all our holiness and innocence of life flow from the election of God.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-54" id="footnote-265-54-backlink">4</a></span> And though the ‘chief design’ of election is ‘the glory of God’, there is for Calvin, nevertheless, an important immediate or subordinate design of the Father’s electing activity, namely, ‘our sanctification’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-55" id="footnote-265-55-backlink">5</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Already an important consequence for our understanding of the Church’s holiness begins to emerge. The dynamic of the Church’s holiness is not that of natural separation and association, but of election, segregation and assembly by God. The holy people of God is a form of common life which owes its origin to a decision and act beyond itself, utterly gratuitous, excluding from consideration ‘everything which men have of themselves’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-56" id="footnote-265-56-backlink">6</a></span> Neither in its origin nor in its continuation is the sanctified community an autonomous gathering; it is – at every moment of its existence – a creature of grace. The dynamic of its life is, therefore, in no sense self-generated. God separates the Church. The Church does not separate itself, for it has neither mandate nor competence to do so; indeed, to try to do so is blasphemy, for it is to try to repeat by a human action the work of election which is God’s alone. The Church’s holiness is the result of the divine decision, not of any human acts of separating a ‘pure’ group from an ‘impure’. In this respect, the true holiness of the Church is very different indeed from purely human social sectarianism, and readings either of the Churches of the New Testament era or of contemporary Christianity that view holiness merely as a sociological or ethnographic quantity miss the point.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-57" id="footnote-265-57-backlink">7</a></span> Only God is properly holy; only God may elect the Church; only an elect Church is sanctified. The Church’s holiness is thus grounded in the election of God the Father.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Second, the Church’s holiness which is the goal or ‘subordinate design’ of election is established in the reconciling work of the Son, who cleansed the Church that it might be holy. ‘[Christ] loved the Church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the Church to himself in splendour, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish’ (Eph. 5.25–27; see also 1 Cor. 1.2; Phil. 1.1). The Father’s will, we have already been told in Ephesians 1, is effected in the Son who ‘sets forth’ (Eph. 1.9) the purpose of the Father. If we ask how the sanctifying purpose of the Father is effected in the Son, Ephesians gives us a range of concepts: redemption (Eph. 1.7); forgiveness of trespasses (Eph. 1.7); being brought near (Eph. 2.13); sacrifice (Eph. 5.2) and, near the end of Ephesians 5, cleansing (Eph. 5.26). Here the metaphor of cleansing recapitulates the entirety of Christ’s saving work: the objective work of Jesus Christ in his death and resurrection, which is the divine act of defeating sin and putting an end to its pollution of humankind; and the applicative work of Jesus Christ in ‘the washing of water with the word’, that is, in baptism and the gospel’s word of promise. That work, moreover, is teleological – unique, unrepeatable, imparticipable, but nevertheless a work which evokes a human trajectory, a social form. Baptism, Calvin remarks, has an ‘aim’; and the aim is twofold: separation or what we might call ‘passive sanctification’ (of which the outward sign is baptism, as the visible confirmation of God’s promise), and ‘active sanctification’, for the end of baptism is ‘that we may live holy and unblameable to God’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-58" id="footnote-265-58-backlink">8</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Third, the Church’s holiness which is the goal of election and which is established in the reconciling work of the Son is perfected by the Holy Spirit. Through the work of the Spirit, the Church, elect and cleansed, is made into a dwelling place of God: the Church ‘is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit’ (Eph. 2.21–22). The work of the Spirit is to ‘perfect’, that is, to bring to completion or full realization the reality which is willed in election and established in reconciliation. The Spirit is God himself consummating the design of reconciliation, whose goal is that there should be covenant fellowship between himself and the creatures whom he has made and redeemed by drawing them into relation with himself. The language here – ‘reconciliation,’ ‘fellowship’, ‘relation’ – is deliberate: it is not the language of participation. ‘In the Lord’ and ‘in the Spirit’ do not mean union of being between God and the Church. Their reference is not to ontological communion but to soteriology and its fruits; they indicate the saving divine agency which creates and recreates fellowship between God and his creatures, anticipated in the Church which is God’s ‘dwelling place’, that is, a form of common life in which the restoration of the covenant is at work. The telos of the work of the Son is ending alienation (Eph. 2.12), breaking down the wall of hostility both within the human realm (between Jew and Gentile) and vertically, by reconciliation to God (Eph. 2.16). That work of reconciliation is pointed to its completion – though not, of course, completed here and now – by the Spirit, who not only effects a renewed relation to God the Father (Eph. 2.18: ‘we both have access in one Spirit to the Father’), but also renews human fellowship, making us into ‘fellow citizens with the saints’ (Eph. 2.19). Crucially, the completion of the work of the Church’s sanctification is not an undertaking of the Church itself; the repetition of ‘through the Spirit’ at the end of Ephesians 2, Calvin says, is partly ‘to remind them that all human powers are of no avail without the operation of the Spirit’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-59" id="footnote-265-59-backlink">9</a></span> In sum: If there exists a covenant people and a communion of saints – if the will of the Father to dwell with humankind is effected, if the reconciling work of the Son is realized in human life and history in a body or form of common life – then it is because the Church exists ‘in the Spirit’, by the Spirit’s agency and by the ever-fresh coming of the Spirit, in the realm of transformation in which the Spirit is Lord. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">So far, then, I have suggested that the ground of the holiness of the Church is the saving work of the Holy Trinity. The Church’s holiness is therefore an <span class="italic">alien</span> sanctity. Because the Church is holy by grace, and because grace is a movement of relation and not a mere handing over of a commodity, then in the case of the Church the attribution of holiness is not a matter of the straightforward ascription of a property. God’s holiness is proper to him; indeed, it is him, for he is originally holy. The holiness of the Church, by contrast, is not a natural or cultural condition. As with all the predicates of the Church, the Church is what it is <span class="italic">spiritually</span>, that is, by virtue of the presence and action of the triune God. This is an application in the matter of holiness of the great ontological rule for the Church which is announced in Eph. 2.8–10: ‘By grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God – not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.’ There we have in brief compass what needs to be said about the ontology of the Church. The Church is what it is by grace. This entails a denial that the agency at the heart of the Church is the Church’s own spontaneity: ‘not your own doing … not because of works’. And it entails an affirmation that the agency at the heart of the Church is God’s, for the Church is ‘God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus’. There is, accordingly, a proper passivity to the being of the Church, for <span class="italic">faith</span> – that is, recognition and assent and trust in the word and work of God – and not <span class="italic">boasting</span> – that is, self-grounded, proud competence – is the fundamental act of the Church’s existence. From this ontological rule about the holy Church’s constitution there follows a further rule about the action of the holy Church: all the acts of the holy Church must demonstrate a reference to the work of the One who alone is holy: the electing Father who reconciles in the Son and perfects in the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Next, therefore, we move to look at the <span class="italic">practices of holiness</span>. What human and social form is taken by this reference to the work of the holy God? How do faith and the absence of boasting become a mode of common life? To answer this, we move to the next proposition which reads: </p>
				<p class="quote"><span class="italic">The holiness of the Church is visible in all its acts as confession of the name of God, the thrice Holy One, the Lord of hosts.</span></p>
				<p class="a-head">IV</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">As we looked at the ground of the Church’s holiness, our thinking was both guided by and directed towards a biblical text; in looking at the matter of the practices of holiness, our thinking may helpfully be instructed by a non-biblical text of great antiquity and endurance in the tradition of the Church’s worship, namely, the ancient Christian hymn usually entitled <span class="italic">Te Deum Laudamus</span>. This hymn is sometimes called the ‘Canticle of Ambrose and Augustine’, from the legend that at the baptism of Augustine by Ambrose the hymn was improvised and sung alternately by the two saints. Probably of late-fourth-century origin, it found its way into Western liturgy as a canticle at the end of the night office, and was incorporated into mattins in the Sarum Breviary and thence into the Reformation Anglican <span class="italic">Book of Common Prayer</span>, where it remains as one of the minor treasures of Anglican public worship. The canticle runs thus:</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>We praise thee, O God : we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>All the earth doth worship thee : the Father everlasting.</p>

				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>O Lord, in thee have I trusted : let me never be confounded.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">It is a lofty text for speaking the praises of almighty God, especially in those repeated glorious Latin vocatives (<span class="italic">Te</span> … ) at the beginning of the lines (lost, sadly, in the English rendering), which thrust the worshipper towards the supreme grandeur of God, the ‘Thou’ who is the centre of Christian praise. The hymn falls into three parts: an act of homage to the Holy Trinity; a recital of the saving work of Christ; and a set of prayers to Christ, asking that he will come to the aid of his people. At its centre, we find this said of the work of the holy Church:</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>The holy Church throughout all the world : doth acknowledge thee;</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>The Father : of an infinite Majesty;</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Thine honourable, true : and only Son;</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Also the Holy Ghost : the Comforter.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">It is this act – the act of acknowledging or, perhaps better, confessing (<span class="italic">confiteor</span>) the holy God, this echoing of the unceasing cry of the cherubim and seraphim – which, I suggest, is the fundamental act of the holy Church. In that act is manifest the basic character of the Church’s holiness, for, in the act of confession, the Church joins with the prophets and apostles and martyrs, all those whose lives have been transfigured by the divine calling, and becomes that human company which is holy in its confession of this one, the Lord God of hosts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">To expand our reflections on this, we address three questions:</p>
				<p class="quote">(1) What is it about confession or acknowledgement that makes it basic to the Church’s holiness?</p>
				<p class="quote">(2) What is it that the holy Church acknowledges in making its confession of the triune God?</p>
				<p class="quote">(3) In what practices of confession is the Church’s holiness visible?</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">(1) <span class="italic">What is it about confession or acknowledgement that makes it basic to the Church’s holiness?</span> ‘We praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord … The holy Church throughout all the world: doth acknowledge thee …’. Confession or acknowledgment is <span class="italic">recognition</span>. It is an action in which the worth, dignity and goodness of that which is other than the Church is accorded the recognition of which it is supremely deserving. In confession, the Church simply assents to God’s reality, uttering its ‘Amen’ to God’s manifest being and works: ‘Blessed be the Lord for ever! Amen and Amen’ (Ps. 89.52). Confession in this sense is not an isolated or discrete activity in the Church’s existence. Rather, in the entirety of its being and in all its activities, the Church acts out the basic structure of confession – it celebrates in all it is and does the fact that it is the creature of God’s mercy. Because of this, the Church’s holiness, too, is at its heart a confession. Holiness, we have seen, is not a static property of the Church but a movement or event. That movement, the history that we call the Church’s holiness, is a twofold movement, or, perhaps better, a commerce between two unequal realities. The history of the Church’s holiness includes as a first and primary movement the condescension of the holy God who mercifully elects, assembles and consecrates the <span class="italic">communio sanctorum</span>. And it includes as a secondary and derivative movement the congregation of the saints, evoked by God’s mercy, among whom and by whom the holiness of Father, Son and Spirit is confessed. The Church’s holiness – again like its unity, catholicity and apostolicity – occurs as part of this history of grace and confession. The Church is holy, that is, as it cries to God: ‘holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts’. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">This acknowledgement originates, of course, in God himself. The Church cannot confess unless God opens its mouth. Confession takes its rise, not in the Church, but in God’s manifestation of himself as the Holy One, in God’s communicative presence as revealer. Revelation is enacted and declared salvation, the visible hand of the holy and merciful Trinity. And revelation generates the communion of saints, the gathering of those called to holiness in fellowship with the everlasting Father, the eternal Son and the Spirit of consolation. Only on the basis of this divine vocation and enabling is it possible for the people of God to say: <span class="italic">Te Deum laudamus.</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">(2) <span class="italic">What is it that the holy Church acknowledges in making its confession of the triune God? </span>The holy Church acknowledges God. The God who is acknowledged in this way is the active subject of the work of salvation. He is the Father of infinite majesty; the true and only Son, worthy of all worship; the Holy Spirit, the comforter – the three-in-one manifest in the divine work of delivering humankind from the bondage of sin. And the Church fulfils the goal of its consecration by God when it confesses this work. In doing so, it joins in the worship which the entire creation offers; hence in the <span class="italic">Te Deum</span> we are given a series of statements ascending from earth to the heavenly throne of God: ‘All the earth doth worship thee … To thee all angels cry aloud … the heavens and all the powers … cherubim and seraphim’ – all these separate praises combine into the great confessional (and theological, and metaphysical) cry: ‘Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of thy glory!’ </p>
				<p class="text-indent">In a little more detail: the holy Church acknowledges the Father of infinite majesty. God’s majesty as Father is the supreme eminence of his being, will and works, a majesty which is limitless in extent, uncontainable, without measure or circumspection, always and everywhere utterly replete. This infinite majesty is not an isolated attribute; it is, rather, a property of the divine essence which characterizes all that God is. And so God’s holiness, too, is inseparable from his majesty; and this is why the holy Church invokes the Father of infinite majesty by crying: ‘Holy!’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The holy Church acknowledges the true and only Son, worthy of all worship. The <span class="italic">Te Deum</span> in its entirety is characterized by an exalted Christology, especially in its recital of the Son’s work of condescension and exaltation, so that over the whole hymn stand the words at the beginning of the second section: <span class="italic">Tu rex gloriae Christe</span>. Here, in the statement of the Holy Trinity as the object of the Church’s praises, the focus is on the person who accomplishes and is manifest in that work. This one is confessed as <span class="italic">truly </span>the Son of God – not Son by adoption, in no sense an annexe to the life of God, but himself ingredient within the divine identity, <span class="italic">vere</span> Deus, of one being with the Father and the Spirit. He is the <span class="italic">only</span> Son of God – the only-begotten, utterly unlike any creature, having an eternal origin, ‘the everlasting Son of the Father’, and therefore not <span class="italic">made</span>. And, being all this, he is accordingly ‘worthy of all worship’ (<span class="italic">venerandus</span>), for he shares in the dignity and glory of the godhead, and is fittingly the object of the devotion of heaven and earth.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This eternal glory of the Son is set forth in the accomplishment of the Son’s mission in time. ‘Glory’ and ‘mission’ – the Son’s eternal and transcendent majesty and his fulfilment in creaturely history of the will of the Father – are in the strictest way correlative. The Son is, in the confession of the holy Church, the king of glory, the Father’s everlasting Son; and it is as this one (not <span class="italic">despite</span> the fact that he is this one) that he sets humankind free from sin and free for holiness. He submits to accomplish this work of deliverance, taking upon himself its ignominy, not shrinking from being born of a woman, and is pierced by the sting of death. And precisely because he does all this, his work is a work of <span class="italic">overcoming</span>: in it, he opens God’s kingdom; having accomplished it, he is seated at the Father’s right hand in glory, from whence he is awaited as judge of all things. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">The holy Church acknowledges the <span class="italic">Holy Spirit</span>, the comforter. The Spirit only enters the recital of the object of the Church’s praise at the end, and it would be easy enough to see this as typically Western pneumatological minimalism. Yet the reference to the Spirit is no mere appendage or afterthought; it is essential to the complete statement of the sweep of salvation history which the <span class="italic">Te Deum</span> celebrates. For the title ‘Comforter’ or ‘Paraclete’ gathers up into one word the fact that the Father and the Son would still be in some measure outside us if it were not for the fact that as Spirit, God undertakes to be present with his holy people for all time (Jn 14.16–17.). The Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son’s name to instruct the saints by bearing witness to Christ (Jn 15.26). Indeed, without this third reference to the Spirit’s perfecting work, the suffrages in the final section of the <span class="italic">Te Deum</span> (‘We therefore pray thee, help thy servants …’) would be a mere undirected cry, without secure hope of any answer. God’s saving of his people, his blessing of his heritage, his governing and uplifting of the people of God, his keeping of his Church without sin, his preservation of the saints as holy – none of this would be possible without the confession of the Spirit’s deity, without the third repetition of the cry: ‘Holy!’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Let us now draw these threads together and indicate their connection to the Church’s holiness. The Church is the communion of the saints as it confesses the name of God the thrice Holy One. God’s name is God in his majestic self-manifestation as Lord and Saviour, the Holy One in our midst. As he utters his name and works his saving work, he creates and preserves for himself a people, set apart for his praise, consecrated to the work of acknowledging that God’s name is holy, and so forming the modest human accompaniment to the confession of the heavenly powers: ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, the God of hosts.’ </p>
				<p class="text-line-above">(3) <span class="italic">In what practices of confession is the Church’s holiness visible? </span>What is the human, historical shape of holiness?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Initially, we need to probe the term ‘visible’ to ensure that we are using it in the right way. A good deal of mainstream modern ecclesiology (especially in its ecumenical versions) has been heavily committed to the visibility of the Church, that is, to the Church’s tangible, historical and material character as an ordered society. Corresponding to this commitment has been a consensus that the notion of the <span class="italic">in</span>visibility of the Church has little to commend it, because it suggests a spiritualizing of the Church into bare subjectivism without objective social form or durability. One result is that a high premium is placed on the externality of the Church, on the historical activity of the Church in which the Church’s being is visible. Clearly there is a truth here: the Church is a real human assembly, known in its acts, and its holiness is therefore a visible phenomenon. But the key question is not<span class="italic"> whether</span> the Church is visible but <span class="italic">what kind of visibility </span>it possesses. The visibility of the Church is not simply that of a natural quantity or life-force or social presence; it is the visibility of the ‘invisible’ Church – what Barth called its ‘very special visibility’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-60" id="footnote-265-60-backlink">10</a></span> In speaking of this ‘special visibility’, Barth did not intend to deny that the Church always has historical concretion and form; he simply sought to affirm that the Church has such visible form by virtue of the presence and action of Christ through the Spirit. ‘Visibility’ is therefore a spiritual event. It is that which can be described only by talking of the active, communicative presence of the triune God. It cannot be converted into mere phenomenal form, and it can be fully perceived only by faith in the word and work of God. There is an immediate consequence of this for talk of the Church’s <span class="italic">holiness</span>. The holiness of God’s holy people is visible not simply as something predicated of the Church on the basis of its activities; to say this would be to convert holiness into something which the Church itself realized, and so to contradict the New Testament’s witness that holiness is ‘in Christ Jesus’ (1 Cor. 1.2; Phil. 1.1). Rather, visible holiness is <span class="italic">confessed</span> of the Church; and that confession is not a recognition of a property which the Church has<span class="italic"> in se</span>, but an acknowledgement of that which it is by virtue of the sovereign work of the triune God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the Church’s practices of holiness, therefore, its action is wholly oriented towards the action of the Holy Trinity, in electing, gathering and consecrating. The Church’s acts do not realize, complete, continue or in any way extend or embody God’s work, which is perfect, and which alone is properly holy. The Church’s acts of holiness, having their origin and their sustaining energy in God, bear testimony to God’s work, accompanying it with their witness, and, in all their human fragility and sinfulness, echoing the holy work of the holy God. How does the holy Church act to accompany and echo the work of God? Four things are to be said.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">First, <span class="italic">the Church’s holiness is visible as it hears afresh the promise and command of the gospel</span>. Holiness occurs as the Church submits once again to the gospel’s judgement and consolation, its publication of salvation and its direction of the people of God in the ways of holiness. The Church is holy as a hearing Church.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Hearing the gospel is never a finished business, never something which the Church has behind it. It is always a fresh activity, and so the Church’s holiness is always a process of the Church becoming holy by standing beneath the word of the gospel as both <span class="italic">promise</span> and <span class="italic">command</span>. Standing beneath the gospel’s <span class="italic">promise </span>means hearing the joyful declaration: ‘Behold your God’. In such hearing the Church is once again faced with the gospel’s affirmation that God is one who comes, one who is with us as saviour, renewing and preserving his people and fulfilling with final authority the divine commitment: I will be your God. The promise of the gospel is that ‘the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all’ (Tit. 2.11); that ‘appearance’ is identical with ‘our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ’ (Tit. 2.13), the one who ‘gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds’ (Tit. 2.14). But to stand beneath that promise of the gospel is already also to stand beneath the gospel’s <span class="italic">commandment</span>: the end of God’s work of purification is active zeal for good deeds. Thus the Church is also holy as it stands beneath the gospel’s commandment. As commandment, the gospel is the declaration of the law, the shape or direction for the life of God’s holy people. Hearing the gospel’s summons to obedience, the Church is holy, submitting to the gospel’s judgement of sin, and setting itself to govern its life by God’s commands. In this way, the Church is holy as it stands beneath the final promulgation of the summons to that holiness which corresponds to the divine commitment of election: You shall be my people. How, then, is the Church holy? By attention and submission to the gospel as the indicative of election and the imperative of obedience.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Second, <span class="italic">the Church’s holiness is visible as it confesses its sin in penitence and faith</span>. The Church is consecrated by the Father’s resolve, holy in Christ and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Such holiness is not achieved perfection, but an alien holiness which is the contradiction of its very real sinfulness. The Church is holy, not because it has already attained the eschatological state of being ‘without spot or wrinkle’, but because the promise and command of the gospel have already broken into its life and disturbed it, shaking it to the core. The Church is holy only as it is exposed to judgement.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This means that, far from being a matter of confident purity, holiness is visible as humble acknowledgement of sin and as prayer for forgiveness. ‘There is no greater sinner than the Christian Church,’ said Luther in his Easter Day sermon in 1531.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-61" id="footnote-265-61-backlink">11</a></span> It is in repentance, rather than in the assumption of moral pre-eminence, that holiness is visible. Thus the Church’s holiness is inseparable from its prayer (again, in the words of the <span class="italic">Te Deum</span>): ‘O Lord have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us.’ Realized moral excellence does not necessarily constitute holiness and may contradict it. Holiness is visible as faith’s penitent cry for forgiveness and mercy, its appeal for God to do what the Church cannot do for itself, namely, to keep it without sin and to gather it into the company of the saints in glory. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Third, <span class="italic">the Church’s holiness is visible as it bears witness to the world</span>. ‘You are … a holy nation … that you may declare’ (1 Pet. 2.9). The <span class="italic">origin</span> of the Church’s holiness, as we have seen, is entirely outside itself; the consequences of this are that, first, it is manifest as a hearing of the gospel’s promise and command, and, second, that its sign is penance, not perfection. Similarly, the goal of the Church’s holiness lies beyond itself. The supreme end of the holiness of the Church is the glorification of God in the obedience of the saints; its intermediate goal is bearing witness. As the fellowship of the saints, the Church declares ‘the wonderful deeds’ of the one who has called the Church out of darkness into light, and so consecrated it for his service. Crucially, the dynamic of holiness includes not only gathering and withdrawal but also sending. The holiness of the saints is not a mere turning inwards; if it were, then it would all too quickly become mere sectarian hostility towards a profane world. If this kind of dynamic of withdrawal is questionable, it is not only because it tends to assume that the line between sin and achieved holiness coincides with the line between the Church and the world. It is also because strategies of withdrawal almost inevitably transpose the divine movement of election and consecration into social exclusivity, and so make the Church’s holiness into a clean sphere over against a polluted world. It is precisely this transposition of holiness into the wrong kind of visibility that is one of the objects of Jesus’ unsparing judgement. The real dynamic of visible holiness has a quite different character. There is, unquestionably, a radical separation, a ‘calling out’ which effects the Church’s separation and which makes its members into a company of ‘aliens and exiles’. And that separation is visible as ‘abstinence’, the Church’s refusal to give itself to ‘the passions of the flesh’. But the end of all this is ‘that you may declare’: holiness is to be maintained ‘among the Gentiles’ not simply to prevent the pollution of the Church, but with the end that ‘they may see your good works and glorify God’ (1 Pet. 2.12; cf. Mt. 5.16; Phil. 2.15). Holiness is visible as testimony, as good works which are transparent to and declare the wonderful deeds of the holy God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Fourth, <span class="italic">the holiness of the Church is visible in its prayer</span>: <span class="italic">‘Hallowed be thy name!’ </span>If the essence of holiness is confession of the Holy Trinity, then the primordial act in which holiness is visible is the Church’s prayer that God’s name be sanctified. That prayer is not, we must note, first and foremost a prayer that the Church itself somehow establish the sanctity of God’s name. Quite the opposite: it is a prayer that God himself hallow his own name. As Barth suggests in his masterful unfinished exposition of the Lord’s Prayer with which the <span class="italic">Church Dogmatics </span>broke off, the petition may be paraphrased thus:</p>
				<p class="quote">Father, do what thou alone canst do. See to it finally, perfectly, and definitively that thou and thy name are known … See to it that thy name is no longer desecrated but always and by everybody regarded as holy in the way that it is in fact holy as thy name that thou thyself has sanctified.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-62" id="footnote-265-62-backlink">12</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Moreover, in praying this prayer, the holy Church is in an important sense looking backwards – back to the ‘unique and definitive divine act which it knows to have taken place already in Jesus Christ … the unique and definitive act whereby God himself hallows his own name. This was and is already the end of all God’s ways, the eschaton.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-63" id="footnote-265-63-backlink">13</a></span> The prayer of the Church, its trustful cry that in this matter God will take up his own cause and demonstrate his holiness, is thus rooted in ‘the sanctifying of God’s name by God himself’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-64" id="footnote-265-64-backlink">14</a></span> And so as it prays this prayer, the Church acts out the constitutive character of its holiness, namely, its indication of the holy name of God enacted in his deeds.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Yet in this indication the Church’s holiness is no mere passive assent to a state of affairs – God’s holiness – before which the Church can simply sit with folded hands. Certainly, this prayer is a prayer ‘for an act that cannot be ours’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-65" id="footnote-265-65-backlink">15</a></span> But to God’s selfsanctification there corresponds the holy Church’s own acts of sanctifying God’s name. For </p>
				<p class="quote">[t]hose who really press and involve God with this petition in the expectation that he will answer it, as people who are seriously and fundamentally disquieted and startled, press and involve themselves too in their own place and manner as people and within the limits of their own human capabilities and possibilities. They declare, and within their limits take on responsibility, that in the matter about which they pray to God something will be done correspondingly by them.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-66" id="footnote-265-66-backlink">16</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">We have already mentioned some of what might be involved in such holy action: hearing the gospel; testimony; and the sanctification of reason. But enclosing and undergirding all these works will be the work of praise. Praise is the great act of rebellion against sin, the great repudiation of our wicked refusal to acknowledge God to be the Lord. In sum, therefore: the Church is holy as, day by day, it magnifies God and worships his name, ever world without end.</p>
