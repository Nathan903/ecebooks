				<p class="a-head">I</p>
				<p class="text">What follows is a set of reflections on the holiness of God from the standpoint of Christian dogmatics. Dogmatics is often caricatured as the unholy science that reduces the practices of piety to lifeless propositions. But far from it: dogmatics is that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ. Set in the midst of the praise, repentance, witness and service of God’s holy people, dogmatics – like all Christian theology – directs the Church’s attention to the realities which the gospel declares and attempts responsibly to make those realities a matter of thought. The task of this short study is to try to learn how the gospel orders our thinking in the high matter of the holiness of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As we approach the topic, it is imperative that we keep in mind two basic requirements for thinking Christianly about God’s holiness. The first is that we need to understand that theological thinking <span class="italic">about</span> holiness is itself an exercise <span class="italic">of</span> holiness. Theology is an aspect of the sanctification of reason, that is, of the process in which reason is put to death and made alive by the terrifying and merciful presence of the holy God. Without sanctification – without being caught up by God and cleansed for the service of God in the fellowship of the saints – the work of theological reason is profitless. The second requirement for thinking Christianly about the holiness of God is that we need to make sure that we are thinking about the true God, and not about some God of our own invention. Theological talk of the holiness of God stands under the same rule as all theological talk, namely, that it is truthful only to the extent that it attempts to follow the given reality of God. That given reality is God’s glorious and free self-presentation as Father, Son and Spirit, the Holy One in our midst, establishing, maintaining and perfecting righteous fellowship with the holy people of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In line with these two basic requirements, this first chapter addresses the question of what kind of thinking we are engaged in when we think theologically about the holiness of God. Following from this, subsequent chapters consider three primary themes: the nature of God’s holiness as Father, Son and Spirit; the holiness of the Church; and the holiness of the Christian. These latter chapters will thus cover holiness in connection with the doctrine of God, the doctrine of the Church, and the doctrine of Christian sanctification. That these three themes cannot be isolated from each other is a point crucial to our understanding of them, for the holiness of the triune God is a holiness which directs itself to God’s creatures as fellowshipcreating holiness. God the thrice Holy One is the Holy One in our midst; and so holiness is a <span class="italic">relational</span> concept, a way of confessing that we encounter the Holy One in his works as Father, Son and Spirit or not at all.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">With these thoughts in mind, we move directly to the first theme, which is the holiness of theology. To give some shape to our thinking, I offer a proposition as the basis of our reflections:</p>
				<p class="quote"><span class="italic">A Christian theology of holiness is an exercise of holy reason; it has its context and its content in the revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity which is set forth in Holy Scripture; it is a venture undertaken in prayerful dependence upon the Holy Spirit; it is an exercise in the fellowship of the saints, serving the confession of the holy people of God; it is a work in which holiness is perfected in the fear of God; and its end is the sanctifying of God’s holy name. </span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">What follows simply works through the proposition, in order to unfold for us how the gospel may order our thinking.</p>
				<p class="a-head">II</p>
				<p class="text"><span class="italic">A Christian theology of holiness is an exercise of holy reason</span>. Christian theology is an aspect of reason’s sanctification; the founding condition for theological reason is reason’s separation by God and its being taken by God into his service. Like all other aspects of human life, reason is a field of God’s sanctifying work. Reason, too – along with conscience, the will and the affections – must be reconciled to the holy God if it is to do its work well. And good Christian theology can only happen if it is rooted in the reconciliation of reason by the sanctifying presence of God. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">To speak in this way is to fly in the face of some deep intellectual and spiritual conventions of modern culture. Modernity has characteristically regarded reason as a ‘natural’ faculty – a standard, unvarying and foundational feature of humankind, a basic human capacity or skill. As a natural faculty, reason is, crucially, not involved in the drama of God’s saving work; it is not fallen, and so requires neither to be judged nor to be reconciled nor to be sanctified. Reason simply is; it is humankind in its intellectual nature. Consequently, ‘natural’ reason has been regarded as ‘transcendent’ reason. Reason stands apart from or above all possible convictions, all particular, historical forms of life, observing them and judging them from a distance. Reason does not participate in history but makes judgements about history; it is a transcendent and sovereign intellectual legislator, and as such answerable to none but itself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Such conceptions of reason have become so deeply embedded in modern culture and its most prestigious intellectual institutions that they are scarcely visible to us. But for the Christian confession, these conceptions are disordered. Above all, they are disordered because they extract reason and its operations from the economy of God’s dealings with his creatures. To think of reason as ‘natural’ and ‘transcendent’ in this way is, by the standard of the Christian confession, corrupt, because it isolates reason from the work of God as creator, reconciler and perfecter. Once reason is thought of as ‘natural’ rather than as ‘created’ (or, to put it differently, once the category of ‘the created’ is collapsed into that of ‘the natural’), then reason’s contingency is set aside, and its sufficiency is exalted in detachment from the divine gift of truth. Or again, when reason is expounded as a natural competency, then it is no longer understood as fallen and in need of reconciliation to God. Again, when reason is considered as a human capacity for transcendence, then reason’s continual dependence on the vivifying Spirit is laid to one side, for natural reason does not need to be made holy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian theology, however, must beg to differ. It must beg to differ because the confession of the gospel by which theology governs its life requires it to say that humankind in its entirety, including reason, is enclosed within the history of sin and reconciliation. The history of sin and its overcoming by the grace of God concerns the remaking of humankind as a whole, not simply of what we identify restrictively as its ‘spiritual’ aspect. And so reason, no less than anything else, stands under the divine requirement that it be holy to the Lord its God. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian theology is a particular instance of reason’s holiness. Here, too – as in all truthful thinking – we are to trace what happens as reason is transformed by the judging, justifying and sanctifying work of the triune God. The sanctification of reason, moreover, involves a measure of difference: reason’s transformation goes hand-in-hand with nonconformity. Holy reason is eschatological reason, reason submitting to the process of the renewal of all things as sin and falsehood are set aside, idolatry is reproved, and the new creation is confessed with repentance and delight. And, if what Paul calls the renewal of the mind (Rom. 12.2) is to be visible anywhere, it has to be in Christian theology, in which holy reason is summoned to address the great matter of God and of all things in God. Thus we move to ask: What is involved in undertaking a <span class="italic">holy</span> theology? How is this singularly demanding occupation to be characterized?</p>
				<p class="a-head">III</p>
				<p class="text">A holy theology <span class="italic">has its context and its content in the revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity</span>. The holy God is not merely some subject-matter entertained by the all-surveying theological mind; he is the majestic one, the one whose communicative presence makes theology possible, the one who is theology’s <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span>. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">A holy theology is responsible to revelation. That is to say, Christian theology is possible only because of the selfcommunicative character of the holy God of the Christian confession. That revelatory, communicative presence forms the context in which theology undertakes its service as holy reason; and that presence also determines the <span class="italic">content</span> of Christian theology.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Revelation may be defined as the self-presentation of the holy Trinity. It is the free work of sovereign mercy, in which the holy God wills, establishes and perfects saving fellowship with himself, a fellowship in which humankind comes to know, love and fear him above all things. We may tease this apart a little. Revelation is the <span class="italic">self-presentation of the holy Trinity</span>. Revelation, that is, is a way of talking about those acts in which God makes himself present. This means that the <span class="italic">content</span> of revelation is God’s own proper reality. Revelation is not to be thought of as the communication of hidden truths, as if in revelation God were lifting the veil on something other than his own self and indicating it to us. Revelation is divine self-presentation; its content is identical with God. To speak of revelation is simply to point to God’s speaking of his own most holy name. Moreover, the agent of revelation is God himself; in revelation the holy God presents himself. The making real of the presence of God is not an undertaking of an agent other than God; God is not inert or inactive but eloquent, ‘speaking out’ of himself. As such, revelation is a<span class="italic"> free work of sovereign mercy</span>. God’s revelation is God’s <span class="italic">spiritual</span> presence. God is the personal subject of the act of revelation, and therefore revelation can in no way be commodified. As spiritual presence, the presence of the holy God is free: it is not called forth by any reality other than himself, but is majestically spontaneous and uncaused. </p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">As the holy God’s self-presentation in free mercy, revelation is the establishment of <span class="italic">saving fellowship</span>. Revelation is purposive. Its end is not simply divine self-display, but the overcoming of human opposition, alienation and pride, and their replacement by knowledge, love and fear of God. In short: revelation is reconciliation. Barth writes: </p>
				<p class="quote">This is what revelation means, this is its content and dynamic: Reconciliation has been made and accomplished. Reconciliation is not a truth which revelation makes known to us; reconciliation is the truth of God Himself who grants Himself freely to us in His revelation.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-2" id="footnote-265-2-backlink">1</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">As the gracious presence of God, revelation is itself the establishment of fellowship. It is not so much an action in which God informs us of other acts of his through which we are reconciled to him; rather, talk about revelation is a way of indicating the communicative force of God’s saving, fellowship-creating presence. God is present as saviour, and so communicatively present. This means, on the one hand, that fellowship with God is communicative fellowship in which God is known. And, on the other hand, it means that knowledge of God in his revelation is no mere cognitive affair: it is to know <span class="italic">God</span> and therefore to love and fear the God who appoints us to fellowship with himself. Revelation is thus not simply the bridging of a noetic divide (though it includes that), but is reconciliation, salvation and therefore fellowship. The idiom of revelation is as much moral and relational as it is cognitional. Revelation is the self-giving presence of the holy God which overthrows opposition to God, and, in reconciling, brings us into the light of the knowledge of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Such is a brief sketch of what is meant by revelation. What does it mean to say that divine revelation, so understood, is the determinative<span class="italic"> context</span> of Christian theology as an exercise of holy reason? Most basically, it means that Christian theology is enclosed by, and does its work within, the sphere of the revelatory presence of the holy God. Christian theology is not a moment of intellectual detachment, a point at which the theologian steps aside from the presence of revelation and the practice of faith and adopts a different – more abstract or critical – stance towards the Christian confession. The theologian does not withdraw from the field of revelation, repentance and discipleship; indeed, he or she cannot, because there is nowhere to which the theologian can withdraw. No less than any other sphere of Christian practice, Christian theology is governed by the commanding, revelatory summons of God’s presence. It takes place within the sphere marked out by that presence; and, if it withdraws from that presence or falls into an attitude of anything less than fear of the holy God, then it has simply stumbled into absurdity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Once again, therefore, we find ourselves running up against the contradictory character of theology as an exercise of holy reason. One of the grand myths of modernity has been that the operations of reason are a sphere from which God’s presence can be banished, where the mind is, as it were, safe from divine intrusion. To that myth, Christian theology is a standing rebuke. As holy reason at work, Christian theology can never escape from the sober realization that we talk in the terrifying presence of the God from whom we cannot flee (Ps. 139.7). In Christian theology, the matter of our discourse is not someone absent, someone whom we have managed to exclude from our own intellectual self-presence and about whom we can talk away safely and undisturbed. We speak in God’s presence. When we begin to talk theologically about the holiness of God, we soon enough discover that the tables have been reversed; it is no longer we who summon God before our minds to make him a matter for clever discourse, but the opposite: the holy God shows himself and summons us before him to give account of our thinking. That summons – and not any constellation of cultural, intellectual or political conditions – is the determinative context of holy reason. There are other contexts, of course, other determinations and constraints in the intellectual work of theology: theology is human work in human history. But those determinations and constraints are all subordinate to, and relativized by, the governing claim of the holy God, a claim which is of all things most fearful but also of all things most full of promise.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity also forms the <span class="italic">content</span> of a Christian theology of holiness. For, as the exercise of holy reason, theology does not invent its content, for its content is given to it, definitively and authoritatively, by the revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity, which is the substance of the Christian confession. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Like all Christian theology, a theology of holiness is a positive science. That is, it works both from and towards a <span class="italic">positum</span>, a given. That given we have already characterized as the communicative presence of God, Father, Son and Spirit. The astonishing reality of revelation is the content of theology as holy reason. Yet, as we shall come to see in a moment, to talk of this as the ‘content’ of theology may easily mislead us into thinking that theology’s subject-matter is merely one more set of ideas that reason might summon before itself in an act of manipulation. Theology’s content, its <span class="italic">object</span>, is always <span class="italic">subject</span>: the free, personal, utterly compelling claim of the holy God. And so theology’s relation to its content is very far from that of master or inspector; much more does theology approach its given content as suppliant, penitent and disciple, for those stances most properly reflect the truth of theology’s condition – its bondage to the given truth of the gospel in which alone reason may find its liberty.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Because it is bound to its object – to God as holy, selfrevealing subject – theological reason does not produce its content from its own resources. Holy reason is not a <span class="italic">poetic</span> but a <span class="italic">receptive</span> enterprise; indeed, in Christian theology poetics is tantamount to idolatry. And so, when theology speaks properly of the holiness of God, its speech is not a <span class="italic">shaping</span> or <span class="italic">figuring</span> of the divine reality by the names which it gives to that reality. Its work is not what has been called ‘discursive imaging activity’, the generation of symbols and ciphers for God, to give some definition to an experience of the numinous.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-3" id="footnote-265-3-backlink">2</a></span> If it undertakes its task in an orderly, responsible and fitting way, then theology is nothing other than an attempt to repeat the name which God gives to himself as he manifests himself with sovereign mercy: ‘I am the Lord, your Holy One’ (Isa. 43.15). Theology is not in the business of <span class="italic">naming</span> God, still less of fashioning whatever symbols for the divine reality may be found enriching, supportive or culturally convenient by the amateurs of religion or its despisers. In speaking of an attribute like holiness, holy reason is radically antinominalist. This is not, of course, to deny that theology has to construct language and concepts; nor is it to deny that, in undertaking that work of construction, theology does not have its own stock of ready-made words and ideas but has to borrow them from elsewhere and adapt them as best it can. To deny this would be to assume total and immediate access to God untouched by reason as human work. But in theology the work of human reason is sanctified work. Theology is reason appointed to the service of revelation, and as such its first task is to remember that in talking of God’s nature it must cease to be <span class="italic">ratio ratiocinans </span>(speculative reason), and learn – painfully, contritely – to be<span class="italic"> ratio ratiocinata</span>: reason which receives its matter from the self-giving of God.</p>
				<p class="a-head">IV</p>
				<p class="text">To sum up so far: God is not summoned into the presence of reason; reason is summoned before the presence of God. That presence, in all its infinite freedom and grandeur and grace, constitutes both the sphere in which holy reason operates, and the matter to which it must ceaselessly direct itself. How is that presence encountered? To this question, our proposition returns a simple answer: the revelatory presence of God is <span class="italic">set forth in Holy Scripture</span>. God’s communicative presence is encountered through Scripture as the Holy One speaks his Word, for Holy Scripture is that creaturely instrument inspired and appointed by God to serve God’s self-presentation. These texts are, to put the matter scripturally, ‘from God’, for in them those ‘moved by the Holy Spirit spoke’ (2 Pet. 1.21). Holy Scripture is the result of a divine movement; it is generated not simply by human spontaneity but by the moving power of the Holy Spirit. That moving power so orders these human, textual acts of communication that they may fittingly serve the publication of the knowledge of God. For our present purposes, this means that holy reason is exegetical reason, reason directed by and directed towards the reading of these texts which are the servants or auxiliaries of God’s own speaking of his word. In the matter of God’s holiness, as in all matters, the fundamental theological responsibility is exegesis. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">At this point a theology of holiness finds itself at a crossroads. Here it will have to make some decisions if it is properly to demonstrate its character as the exercise of holy reason. It can go about its work in one of two ways. It can proceed by first of all elaborating a phenomenology of ‘the holy’, which will then form the basis of a theological account of God’s holiness and its entailments for human sanctification. Or it can proceed directly to the exegetical and dogmatic tasks, bypassing the attempt to root its considerations in a religious phenomenology. I am unconvinced of the fruitfulness of the first option. That option has had and continues to have a powerful presence, both in some dominant styles of religious and cultural studies, and in those modern Christian theologies which do their work under the spell of Tillich’s correlation of ‘the holy’ and ‘the divine’. Yet in the end such phenomenologies have contributed little to constructive Christian dogmatics. Most of all, this is because in them the generic notion of ‘the holy’ has been accorded priority over exegesis, and has in effect swamped the specificity of a Christian understanding of holiness. For a ‘positive’ Christian theology, one which is strictly governed by attention to revelation through exegesis of the canon, the holiness of which the prophets and apostles speak is not a particular version of a universal religious phenomenon. The holiness of which they speak is made known in the history of God’s works of creation and reconciliation; in those works God, as it were, expounds his being to us. Those works determine the content of holiness; the holiness of God and of those realities which God sanctifies is not simply ‘the sacred’; it is, rather, inseparably bound to the enacted identity of this God. To say ‘holy’ in its Christian sense is to point to this one, to who he is and to what he does as maker, reconciler and sanctifier of his creatures. Holiness is not simply Otto’s famous <span class="italic">mysterium tremendum</span><span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-4" id="footnote-265-4-backlink">3</a></span> or ‘the quality of that which concerns man ultimately’,<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-5" id="footnote-265-5-backlink">4</a></span> or Derrida’s ‘unscathed which is safe and sound’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-6" id="footnote-265-6-backlink">5</a></span> For a holy theology, abstractions like ‘the holy’ are best avoided, for what there is is the Holy One, the One known by the holy name, the One who has bared his holy arm. And for the knowledge of this One, what is required is exegesis of Holy Scripture. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">There are two consequences here for the working of holy reason. First, because Holy Scripture is the <span class="italic">authoritative canon</span>, holy reason finds there its <span class="italic">norm</span>. To say that Holy Scripture is the authoritative canon is to say that this determinate collection of writings, received and read as a unified God-given prophetic and apostolic testimony, legitimately claims the acknowledgement, assent and obedience of the Church and its theology. The authority of Scripture for holy reason is Scripture’s Spiritbestowed capacity to quicken theology to truthful thought and speech. Truthful thought and speech follow the given order of reality. That which has authority, be it text or person, directs reason to that given order, and so forms reason’s acts; authority is potent because it bears the truth to us and orders reason in accordance with reality. Hence the authority of Scripture is a matter for the Church’s <span class="italic">acknowledgement</span>, not its <span class="italic">ascription</span>. Authority cannot be conferred on Scripture by the Church or by its theology, but only greeted as that which legitimately commands the activity of reason. As such, Scripture’s authority is not at all abstract or merely formal; it is the servant of the living voice of God as truth that enables the Church to live from and in the truth.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">How does this norm operate? If it acts in accordance with this given norm, the work of theology must demonstrate what can be described in the most general terms as a biblical character. That is to say, it must be characterized above all by a deference to the reality of the gospel that is announced in Holy Scripture. That deference is expressed in many ways: by refusal of speculation; by resistance to the pressure to soften the imperative force of <span class="italic">sola scriptura</span> or <span class="italic">tota scriptura</span>; by the transparency of the language and concepts of theology to the scriptural canon; and above all, by the persistence, joy and humility with which holy reason addresses itself to the task of <span class="italic">reading</span> Scripture, not as master but as pupil, and by a willingness to learn in its school. All this is involved in speaking of Holy Scripture as the norm of holy reason.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Second, because Holy Scripture is <span class="italic">sufficient</span>, holy reason finds there its <span class="italic">limit</span>. The sufficiency of Scripture is an essential corollary of its authority as the inspired servant of the Word of God (indeed, it might be said that where a clear sense of the sufficiency of Scripture is lacking, one may legitimately doubt whether proper assent has been given to Scripture’s authority). The sufficiency of Scripture means that in Holy Scripture may be found all that is needed for faith to know the gospel. Scripture is sufficient for its end, which is the publication of the saving knowledge of God. Holy reason therefore finds in Scripture its limit – that is, the point beyond which holy reason <span class="italic">may</span> not pass because it <span class="italic">need </span>not pass. If Scripture as <span class="italic">norm</span> requires theology to read with deference, Scripture as <span class="italic">limit</span> requires theology to demonstrate a distinctive focus in its work. That is, talk of the sufficiency of Scripture is a warning against allowing theology’s imagination to be enticed into giving attention to all manner of sources of fascination; for however enriching and fruitful they may present themselves to be, in the end they nearly always constitute a distraction. Theology cannot be and do and say everything; when theology does strive to relate itself to all kinds of other fields of intellectual and cultural activity, then – however much it may do so in good faith and with praiseworthy intentions – it risks losing its determinacy, integrity and stability as the attempt to hear and repeat the one Word of God. Holy reason will therefore be characterized by a focused intensity; by getting on with its job, politely ignoring the dissuaders, declining pressing invitations to involve itself in all sorts of extramural work, and instead giving itself singlemindedly to building the walls of the city of God. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Once again, to sum up: we have been pondering the statement that, as an exercise of holy reason, a Christian theology of holiness has both its context and its content in the revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity as set forth in Holy Scripture, and that Holy Scripture thus functions as both norm and limit. From here we move to depict a little more closely how holy reason undertakes the office to which it is has been appointed. Four things are here to be noted: the <span class="italic">primary act</span> of holy reason is prayer for the assistance of the Holy Spirit; the<span class="italic"> setting</span> of holy reason is the fellowship of the saints; the <span class="italic">manner </span>of holy reason is fear of the holy God; and the <span class="italic">end</span> of holy reason is the sanctifying of God’s holy name. We look at each of these in turn.</p>
				<p class="a-head">V</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">As the exercise of holy reason, Christian theology is a <span class="italic">venture undertaken in prayerful dependence upon the Holy Spirit</span>. Holy reason, we have seen, is a human act undertaken in God’s revelatory and reconciling presence. Reason does not stand apart from that presence, enjoying independence from God. Quite the contrary: if reason is to fulfil its office and to struggle towards truthful judgements, then it must be reconciled to God. This work of reconciliation is, however, the work of God himself and of God alone. It can only be God’s work, for reason’s alienation from truth entails reason’s incapacity. Alienated from the given order of God’s truth and repudiating its calling as God’s creature, reason subverts that relation to the holy God which is the essential condition for knowledge of the truth. In Paul’s terms in Rom. 1: reason is absolutely jeopardized by the creature’s refusal to glorify God or exist in gratitude, and so reason becomes futile, senseless and dark. Out of that futility, senselessness and darkness is born idolatry, that fateful exchange of truth for lies, and of worthy objects of worship and service for images. Calvin comments:</p>
				<p class="quote">[T]hey forsook the truth of God and turned aside to the vanity of their own reason, which is completely undiscriminating and impermanent. Their <span class="italic">senseless heart</span> being thus darkened could understand nothing correctly, but in every way was borne headlong into error and falsehood. This was their unrighteousness, that the seed of true knowledge was immediately choked by their wickedness before it grew to maturity.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-7" id="footnote-265-7-backlink">6</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Of such vanity, God alone can cure us. This God does through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit judges, slays and regenerates reason to the end that it may once again fulfil its calling, honouring and giving thanks to God. Through the Holy Spirit, God’s holiness is brought to bear on the work of reason. As we shall come to see in the next chapter when we turn to look more directly at holiness as a divine attribute, God’s holiness may be understood under two aspects. One is what the great theologian of the attributes of God Hermann Cremer called ‘God’s active <span class="italic">opposition</span> to sin’ (<span class="italic">die Gegenwirkung Gottes gegen die Sünde</span>); the other is God’s sanctification or separation of creaturely instruments for the service of his glory.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-8" id="footnote-265-8-backlink">7</a></span> God’s holiness as <span class="italic">opposition</span> is undertaken in the Spirit’s work of<span class="italic"> mortificatio</span> (putting to death); God’s holiness as <span class="italic">sanctification</span> is undertaken in the Spirit’s work of <span class="italic">vivificatio </span>(making alive). And both can – indeed must – be extended into a Christian description of the work of reason, and so of theology. Such a description does not, of course, entail a denial of the creatureliness of our intellectual activity (any more than to talk of human moral sanctity is to undermine our sense that we are, indeed, moral agents). What it does is specify what <span class="italic">kind</span> of creaturely activity we are engaged in when we do the works of holy reason. The kind of creaturely activity we are engaged in is, I suggest, best described as a dying and rising again.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Holy reason is mortified reason. It is reason which has been judged and destroyed as it has been set under the judgement of God against what Paul calls ‘all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth’ (Rom. 1.18). That judgement and destruction was effected once for all at the cross of the Son of God, the one in whose dying God destroyed the wisdom of the wise (Isa. 29.14; 1 Cor. 1.18–19). And holy reason continues to live out mortification as it carries the dying of Jesus within itself – that is, as it submits to the requirement of unceasing repentance, as the Spirit of holiness reproves reason’s idolatry, pride, vain curiosity and ambition, as – in short – reason unlearns falsehood and is taught the truth. Holy reason is also reason made alive. If it is subject to the Holy Spirit’s reproof as Lord, it is no less subject to the same Spirit’s regenerative work as the giver of life. Through the life-giving Spirit, reason is given direction, and thereby turned to its proper end, which is the knowledge of the holy God and of all things in him. And through the Spirit, reason is made capable: its calling renewed, reason is instructed and equipped by the Spirit. And, through this sanctifying work of the Spirit, reason becomes ‘holy’, set apart by God so that it may undertake the ministry for which it was both made and remade.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This is why the venture of theological reason can only be undertaken in prayer for the coming of the Holy Spirit. Because theological work is always a process of mortification and regeneration, at its heart is the act of beseeching God for instruction:</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Make me to know thy ways, O Lord;</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>teach me thy paths.</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Lead me in thy truth, and teach me … (Ps. 25.4–5)</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Such prayer is not merely ornamental in theology; it is of the essence. In prayer reason looks to God, confessing its inadequacy and its need to be led into God’s truth, and trusting confidently in the Spirit’s instruction:</p>
				<p class="quote">The first and basic act of theological work is <span class="italic">prayer</span> … [T]heological work does not merely begin with prayer and is not merely accompanied by it; in its totality it is peculiar and characteristic of theology that it can be performed only in the act of prayer.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-9" id="footnote-265-9-backlink">8</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">To speak thus of intellectual work may sound strange, even ludicrous: can such an account be anything other than a hopelessly idealized, even mythological, account of the rational activities which make up the study of divinity? And faced with this suspicion, might it not be less embarrassing to make a much softer claim – about the pious disposition or spiritual virtues of the theologian? But talk of theology as the exercise of holy reason is not just talk of a certain setting of the theologian’s affections; in the last analysis, holiness is not a psychological or a religious quantity. Reason is holy because God acts upon reason, arresting its plunge into error and freeing it from its bondage to our corrupt wills and our hostility to God. And to describe theological work as a work of holy reason is to say that, without talk of this God and his acts of judgement and renewal, we cannot depict what happens when we take it upon ourselves to venture the work of the theologian.</p>
				<p class="a-head">VI</p>
				<p class="text">Next, as holy reason theology is <span class="italic">an exercise in the fellowship of the saints, serving the confession of the holy people of God</span>. God’s holiness, we shall come to see, is fellowship-creating holiness. The holiness of God is confessed in the Christian tradition as the holiness of the triune God, the One made known as Father, Son and Spirit, the One who turns to his creation as its maker, reconciler and perfecter. It is, accordingly, a holiness which assembles and upholds a human community, set apart as the communion of saints to be the human answer to God’s holy love. And theology is an undertaking of this<span class="italic"> sanctorum communio</span>, reason designated to serve the community’s confession of the Holy Trinity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Because of this, first, theology is an <span class="italic">activity undertaken within the fellowship of the saints</span>. The realm of theology is the realm of the Church. Theology partakes of the same holy things as does the Church. It hears the same gracious Word of God in the gospel; it stands beneath the same judgement which that Word pronounces, and receives the same absolution from the Word; it is nourished and renewed by the same Spirit through Scripture and sacrament; it is a participant in the same praise and petition; it directs itself by the same confession; it, too, is marked by the same separation from the wickedness which profanes God’s holy name. Though the institutional arrangements of theology in modernity have often made it hard for us to see this point, theology is not a <span class="italic">transcendent </span>moment, some activity of the mind standing above the merely domestic life of the Christian community and submitting it to an ironic, critical gaze. Holy reason is ecclesiastical science – a knowing and inquiring which takes place within ‘the commonwealth gathered, founded, and ordered by the Word of God’, and participating in the calling and promise which God issues to that commonwealth.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-10" id="footnote-265-10-backlink">9</a></span> Modernity, of course, denies the title ‘science’ to any such activity, just as it denies the title ‘reason’ to those intellectual acts which take their rise in the confession of the gospel. But those denials tell us more about modernity than they do about science or reason, and a confident, holy theology will not be too troubled by them, but simply fulfil its office with diligence and with deference to the call of God in the fellowship of the saints. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Theology is, second, an exercise of<span class="italic"> fellowship with the saints</span>. As it does its work in the commonwealth of God’s people, theology renders its assistance to the community to which it belongs. Its particular ministry is to help in the edification of the Church, building up the Church’s common life and so serving the confession of the gospel. Theology does this, very simply, by giving an account of the substance of the gospel as that to which all speech, thought and action in the Church must conform. In the work of holy reason, the communion of saints submits its life to the gospel’s appraisal, testing its apprehensions of God by judging them against the one norm of all truth, God’s revelatory presence as holy Word. As it does its theology, the Church inquires whether it really speaks, thinks and acts as the communion of saints; whether the gospel has been truly, repentantly and fully heard; whether the promises and commands of the gospel have been acknowledged in all their authority and grace; whether in their confession of the gospel the elect of God are truly holy and blameless before him. Crucially, however, theology does not perform this task as the Church’s Lord or judge. How could it? The Church has only one Lord and judge, the Holy One himself, whose office theology may not arrogate to itself. Rather, theology’s critical work is undertaken by exemplary submission to the gospel – by theology itself standing beneath the Word of God which assembles the community, by governing its own speech and thought by the given truth of the gospel, above all, by looking to God, acknowledging that, like all things in the life of the Church, theology is impossible unless God makes it possible. Only in this way – humbly and without pretence – can holy reason stand in fellowship with the saints of God and serve their confession.</p>
				<p class="a-head">VII</p>
				<p class="text">Our next clause draws together the foregoing by indicating something of the manner of theology as holy reason. Theology is a work in which <span class="italic">holiness is perfected in the fear of God</span>. The perfection of holiness – that is, its completion or fulfilment – involves the fear of God (2 Cor. 7.1). Holiness is set out by Paul in 2 Cor. 6 as a cleansing which involves both a radical separation from that which is unclean, and also fellowship with God the Father. And holiness reaches its completeness in the fear of the Lord who is the beginning of wisdom. What does this mean for theology as holy reason?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Theology exists under the same condition as all other activity in the life of faith, namely, that it is done in the presence of the Holy One who ‘meets us as unconditional majesty’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-11" id="footnote-265-11-backlink">10</a></span> Because God is majestic and therefore to be feared before all things, to encounter him is to be encountered by that which we can never master, which can never become an object, an idea or pattern of words or experience that we can retrieve and inspect at will. The holy God is utterly free; even in his approach to humankind in which he elects and sanctifies a people for himself, he is not a disposable asset, an entity which can become part of the religious or cultural stock of his people. ‘You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be hallowed among the people of Israel; I am the Lord who sanctify you’ (Lev. 22.32). This requirement – that God be feared and his name hallowed – is in many respects the requirement for theological reason. Reason can only be holy if it resists its own capacity for idolatry, its natural drift towards the profaning of God’s name by making common currency of the things of God. A holy theology, therefore, will be properly mistrustful of its own command of its subject-matter; modest; aware that much of what it says and thinks is dust. God’s holiness means that theology stands under the prohibition: ‘Do not come near’ (Ex. 3.5). Accordingly, theology will be characterized less by fluency and authority, and much more by weakness, a sense of the inadequacy of its speeches to the high and holy matter to which it is called to bear testimony. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Nevertheless, this prohibition is not an absolute moment by which reason is entirely incapacitated. Alongside the prohibition stands with equal force an imperious command to speak: ‘Who has made man’s mouth? … Is it not I, the Lord? Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak’ (Ex. 4.11–12). The command is also a promise – that God will make holy reason capable of that of which sin makes it incapable; that because the speeches of reason are in the hands of God, they may also serve in the indication of the gospel’s truth. Idolatry is reproved, not by silence, but by speeches that set forth what God has taught. And in such speeches, holy reason gives voice to the fear of God.</p>
				<p class="a-head">VIII</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">What, finally and very briefly, is the end or telos of the work of theology as holy reason? It is what Jonathan Edwards called ‘an high esteem of God’,<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-12" id="footnote-265-12-backlink">11</a></span> a <span class="italic">sanctifying of God’s holy name</span>. The sanctifying or hallowing of the holy name of God is, as we shall come to see later, the basic end of all the works of the fellowship of the saints: </p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Let them praise thy great and terrible name! </p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Holy is he! (Ps. 99.3)</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">or again:</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord,</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>(Ps. 145.21)</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Praise, blessing and sanctifying add nothing to God; they do not and cannot expand or enrich God’s holiness, which is inexhaustibly and unassailably full and perfect. They are simply an acknowledgement and indication. And theology as holy reason finds its completion in such acknowledgement and indication. To talk of the end of reason in these terms is once again to refuse to segregate intellectual activity from other acts of discipleship. Holy reason is a practice in the life of the communion of the saints; as such, it partakes in the movement of the Church, sharing its origin and participating in its goals. To abstract holy reason from that movement is to arrest its course. And not only that, neglect of the true ends of the intellectual activity of theology in the praise of God nearly always involves their substitution by other ends, the elevation of technical, historical or philosophical reason, and their detachment from repentant and joyful service of God’s holy name. One could organize an entire history of modern theology around that theme: the intellectual afflictions which have attended the progressive detachment of reason from piety.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">None of this should be taken as a suggestion that holy reason is other than a human activity. Theology is not inspired; it is not a sacrament of the gospel; it does not have the authority of the teaching office in the Church. It is not a means of grace, but the human work of thinking and speaking about the holy God. Because it is always a human work, it participates in the frailty and fallibility of its practitioners and of their times. Theology’s reference to revelation does not raise it out of the stream of all other human rational endeavour. Yet <span class="italic">in</span> – not <span class="italic">despite</span> – its very human character, theology can be holy reason. It can serve the Holy One and the congregation which gathers around him, wrestling with him, beseeching his blessing, and then like Jacob limping on its way.</p>
