				<p class="a-head">I</p>
				<p class="text">The first chapter reflected on one of the two basic requirements for thinking Christianly about the holiness of God, namely that because such thinking does its work in the presence of the self-giving holy God, it must be a work of holy reason, reason consecrated to the service of the holy God in the communion of his saints. Reason’s task in this matter is to ‘exhibit’ God’s ‘wonderful name’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-13" id="footnote-265-13-backlink">1</a></span> That holy name, which God himself speaks and to which theology must give reason’s reverence, is his name as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Only as it is a repetition of that name can our thinking about the holiness of God himself be governed by the second basic requirement for all Christian thinking about God, namely, that it must be thinking which is concerned with the true God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">As we turn, then, to consider holiness as a divine attribute, our task is to outline a trinitarian dogmatics of the holiness of God. Dogmatics, once again, is not a speculative enterprise, a conceptual improvement upon the gospel as it is announced in Holy Scripture. The objective of dogmatics is very simple: again in Calvin’s words, to provide ‘godly minds with a sort of index to what they should particularly look for in Scripture concerning God’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-14" id="footnote-265-14-backlink">2</a></span> And to guide us on our way, another proposition:</p>
				<p class="quote"><span class="italic">God’s holiness is the holiness of Father, Son and Spirit, the one who bears his holy name, who is holy in all his works, and who is the Holy One in our midst, establishing, maintaining and perfecting righteous fellowship with the holy people of God.</span></p>
				<p class="a-head">II</p>
				<p class="text"><span class="italic">God’s holiness is the holiness of Father, Son and Spirit</span>. All the attributes of God are identical with God’s essence; but his essence is his being and act as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. God is holy in his triune being and activity. Thus when, in accordance with the Christian confession, we talk of the holiness of God, the God of whom we speak is <span class="italic">this</span> God; and what theology is required to say about holiness is determined at every point by the fact that it is confessed of this one.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">From the very outset, this means that a trinitarian dogmatics of holiness has to follow a quite distinctive path, one already marked out for it by the self-presence of God, yet one to which it can only adhere by a measure of resoluteness, as well as by a measure of cheerful freedom from the conventions of neighbouring fields of rational activity. The distinctiveness can be brought out by noting three particular demarcations.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">First, however disapproving its postmodern neighbours may be, however sheerly atavistic it may seem, a trinitarian dogmatics of the holiness of God will be an exercise in ‘ontotheology’. For its concern is – with fear and trembling – to give a conceptual depiction of the Church’s confession of the works and ways of the Holy Trinity. And such a depiction necessarily requires an ontology – an account of the being, nature and properties of God. This ontology must certainly be resolutely dogmatic, that is, governed by the gospel’s annunciation of the history of God with us; and it must, therefore, of necessity be engaged in a dispute with metaphysical theism about the nature of God. But dogmatics ought to be unpersuaded that Christian theology can long survive the abandonment of ontotheology, and ought to think long and hard before it hands over the doctrine of God for deconstruction. The undeniably corrosive effects of certain traditions of metaphysics are best retarded, not by repudiating ontology, but by its fully Christian articulation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Second, the distinctiveness of a trinitarian dogmatics of the holiness of God will be shown in its lack of interest in making use of religious phenomenology as a foundation for positive Christian teaching, or in correlating its findings with inquiries into the phenomena – cultural, anthropological and religious – of ‘the holy’. The remarkable prestige enjoyed by Rudolf Otto’s work <span class="italic">Das Heilige</span> over much of the last century is partly explicable by the companionability of his project to a wide range of theologians – by no means simply of revisionist leanings – who found in the concept of ‘the holy’ a ground or correlate or parallel for some of the things which Christian theology has to say about God. Paul Tillich wrote:</p>
				<p class="quote">Holiness is an experienced phenomenon; it is open to phenomenological description. Therefore, it is a very important cognitive ‘doorway’ to understanding the nature of religion, for it is the most adequate basis we have for understanding the divine. The holy and the divine must be understood correlatively.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-15" id="footnote-265-15-backlink">3</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Much might be said by way of critical reflection on the project which Tillich announces: its appeal to generics such as ‘religion’ and ‘the divine’; its intellectualist assumption that ‘understanding’ the divine is superior to practice; and its foundationalist entanglements. In dogmatic terms, however, the most problematic feature is the detachment of holiness from personal divine presence and action. From this perspective, Tillich’s definition of holiness to which reference was made earlier – ‘the <span class="italic">quality</span> of that which concerns man ultimately’ – seems a curiously lame account of the matter, in which the Lutheran <span class="italic">pro me</span> is dissolved into a modulation of human selfhood, lacking reference to the force and sheer particularity of God’s self-communicative presence that dogmatics must struggle to retain.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Third, a trinitarian dogmatics of God’s holiness will find itself at a distance from important features of the accounts of the divine attributes offered in some dominant styles of analytical philosophical theology. The reader of such work is immediately struck by the absence of serious engagement with divine holiness in the presentations of the attributes of God that are offered there, and the distinct preference for devoting the lion’s share of attention to the so-called metaphysical attributes such as omnipotence or omniscience.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-16" id="footnote-265-16-backlink">4</a></span> The reasons for this neglect are varied: a strange incapacity to deal with the positivities of particular religious beliefs and practices; a corresponding preference for highly abstract, simplified renderings of the content of Christian belief as a version of ‘natural religion’; a reluctance to allow trinitarian doctrine to play any fundamental role in shaping an account of God’s being; the isolation of discussion of the attributes of God from consideration of the works of God in the economy of salvation. But all these features are undergirded by the way in which priority is often given to questions of the essence of God over questions of the character of God’s existence.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-17" id="footnote-265-17-backlink">5</a></span> One immediate effect of this prioritizing is that metaphysics as the science of being has precedence over exegesis and dogmatics (which are simply the domestic reflection of the ecclesial congregation), since metaphysics, from the early modern period, has assumed responsibility for the task of developing an account of first principles.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-18" id="footnote-265-18-backlink">6</a></span> Modern analytical philosophical theology is in many respects a continuation of that division of labour, especially when the overall project of philosophical theology is conceived to be that of giving ‘reasons for the rational intelligibility of the world and of human being in the world in the framework of a <span class="italic">conception of God</span>’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-19" id="footnote-265-19-backlink">7</a></span> The use of the concept of God in this way – its deployment in the task of complete explanation – shapes its <span class="italic">content</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Two consequences are to be noted. First, when the concept of God is shaped by proofs for the existence of God which themselves serve to underwrite a complete explanation of reality, then considerable weight is attached to the so-called metaphysical attributes of God:</p>
				<p class="quote">The interpretation of reality which is provided by the theistic proofs is only coherent if God can be seen as a being with specific attributes. As the universal ground of existence and explanation God must be understood as necessary, immutable, uncaused, omnipotent, eternal, omnipresent, omniscient and in every respect perfect.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-20" id="footnote-265-20-backlink">8</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Holiness tends to be a casualty of this process because it is apparently less crucial in laying out what kind of being God must be conceived to be if he is to be the ground of the world’s existence. Second, this use of the concept of God characteristically restricts the relation between God and the creation to one between causal power and product; language of God as personal agent-in-relation scarcely features. Once again, therefore, holiness recedes from view, for as a ‘relative’ or ‘personal’ attribute holiness is less important in giving an account of God as the world’s ontological ground. But, as we shall come to see, a trinitarian dogmatics, its attention focused on the being of God as displayed in God’s work in the economy, will be uneasy with the distinction between metaphysical and relative attributes, and will seek assiduously to root its account of God’s holiness in the specifically Christian confession of God as Father, Son and Spirit. It will seek to avoid the mistake of abstraction: the mistake, that is, of thinking that the doctrine of the Trinity makes no real difference. For the Christian confession, the doctrine of the Trinity makes all the difference in the world, for that doctrine is at the heart of the Christian gospel, and so at the heart of the Christian understanding of the nature of God and of the manner of God’s relation to the world. The doctrine of the Trinity is the Christian understanding of God; and so the doctrine of the Trinity shapes and determines the entirety of how we think of God’s nature, including how we think of God’s holiness. In short: God is holy as Father, Son and Spirit.</p>
				<p class="a-head">III</p>
				<p class="text">God’s holiness is the holiness of Father, Son and Spirit, that is, <span class="italic">the holiness of the One who bears his holy name</span>. Like all the attributes of God, the attribute of holiness is an indication of the name of God. God’s <span class="italic">name</span> is his enacted identity, God’s sheer, irreducible particularity as <span class="italic">this One</span> who is and acts <span class="italic">thus</span>. God’s name is his incomparability, his uniqueness. Bearing this name, God is not simply holy mystery, the nameless and voiceless whence of some sense of the numinous, an ineffable and indefinite deity. In his unalterable and unassailable majesty he is the one who he is: the self-determining one, wholly beyond the reach of any comparison or class: ‘I am the Lord, that is my name’ (Isa. 42.8).<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-21" id="footnote-265-21-backlink">9</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">As the one who is utterly incomparable, who is in every respect <span class="italic">a se</span>, God names himself. The name which God <span class="italic">bears</span> is the name which God <span class="italic">speaks</span>. When human speech takes it upon itself to repeat this name, whether in praise or proclamation or in the work of holy reason, God’s name is not ascribed but confessed; God receives his name from no one but himself, for his identity is altogether self-originating. Theological talk of the divine attributes is, correspondingly, not a <span class="italic">proposal</span>, a projection of a category onto God, a naming. It is, rather, a repetition of God’s name, a conceptual expansion of that name which does not add to it or go beyond it, but simply utters it as it has already been uttered, returning to it as that which cannot be enhanced, or mastered, or resolved into anything other than itself. All theological talk of the attributes of God traces God’s own enactment of his name; and so theological talk of God’s holiness simply says: ‘the Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God’ (1 Ki. 18.39).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Theological talk of the divine attributes is thus not primarily a matter of categorization but of confession; the attributes of God are conceptual glosses on God’s name, indicators of God’s identity. It was for this reason that the classical dogmatic tradition insisted that when theology enumerates a range of different attributes of God, it is not denoting different realities within the divine being; rather, each of the attributes designates the totality of the being of God under some particular aspect. That is to say, language about the different divine attributes must not compromise the principle which Augustine enunciated in saying that God is ‘simple beyond all comparison’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-22" id="footnote-265-22-backlink">10</a></span> God’s simplicity means that God is beyond composition; different divine attributes do not, therefore, denote separate parts of God which, when assembled, together make up the divine identity. Rather, the enumeration of divine attributes is simply a designation of God’s simple essence. The attributes are not <span class="italic">accidentia</span>, accidental qualities in God by virtue of which God can be said to be, for example, holy or wise, for God is <span class="italic">essentially</span> holy and wise. ‘In God,’ as Augustine puts it, ‘to be is the same as … to be wise.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-23" id="footnote-265-23-backlink">11</a></span> Thus the range of the divine attributes indicates nothing other than the divine essence in its purity and simplicity. </p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Accordingly, classical dogmatics was reluctant to allow that the divine attributes may be distinguished <span class="italic">realiter</span> – this, because of a desire to maintain that ‘every attribute is a manifestation of the same absolutely simple essentiality of God’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-24" id="footnote-265-24-backlink">12</a></span> The danger – of which classical dogmatics was sharply aware – was that such an affirmation might quickly slip into nominalism. For if a powerful doctrine of the simplicity of God leads us to assert that the various attributes of God are distinguished merely <span class="italic">rationaliter</span>, then scepticism can follow: talk of the divine properties is left unattached to the divine reality, and God can easily become a blank, unnameable void.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-25" id="footnote-265-25-backlink">13</a></span> As a safeguard, it is important to maintain that, although the distinctions which reason makes between the different divine attributes do not correspond in any straightforward way to distinctions within God’s most simple being, they are, for all that, not merely rational or notional distinctions. They are distinctions which are founded upon the reality of that by which reason is accosted – the self-presence of God as creator, reconciler and perfecter; and so they are the work of <span class="italic">ratio ratiocinata</span>, and not merely mental projections:</p>
				<p class="quote">To our so-called formal concepts, really differentiated from each other, there answer on God’s side various objective concepts, the note of which in God is but the one infinite perfection, apprehensible by our understanding, owing to its native finitude and weakness, only in various acts, in parts as it were.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-26" id="footnote-265-26-backlink">14</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This sounds fiercely abstract; but underlying its formality is a deep principle of all Christian talk of God, namely that such talk is an indication of the pure and singular act of God’s being, his being for himself by his being for us in his merciful work as Father, Son and Spirit. God’s simplicity is his irreducible ‘thisness’, executed in the drama of his works. The simple act in which God is who he is is the act of what Jüngel calls ‘the <span class="italic">concrete simplicity</span> of God’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-27" id="footnote-265-27-backlink">15</a></span> To talk of God’s simplicity, and thus of God’s attributes as all denoting that simplicity, is not to reduce God to a point (pure will, perhaps, or pure cause), but to refer to the ‘inexhaustible fullness’ of God’s triune being and act.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-28" id="footnote-265-28-backlink">16</a></span> God’s simplicity is God’s singular plenitude, what Augustine in a lovely phrase calls ‘simple multiplicity or manifold simplicity’, and what I have called God’s ‘name’ or ‘enacted identity’, the fullness from which we have all received, grace upon grace. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">To sum up, therefore: when theology speaks of the attributes of God, it is attempting a rich set of conceptual enlargements upon God’s concrete simplicity, the rendition of his identity which God gives as the one who is. God’s love, mercy, patience, righteousness and holiness, God’s infinity, impassibility, changelessness and omnipotence, all say one thing, at once most simple and most comprehensive: <span class="italic">God is</span>. The content of the term ‘holiness’ in the case of God is wholly determined by its reference to God’s person. The predicate (holy) is exhaustively defined by the subject (the triune God). Holiness, the Romanian Orthodox theologian Staniloae remarks, is not ‘the attribute of impersonal mystery’ but ‘the attribute of transcendence as person’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-29" id="footnote-265-29-backlink">17</a></span> That is, holiness is a predicate of the personal being, action and relation of the triune God, of God’s concrete execution of his simplicity; it is not a quality in abstraction, but an indicator of God’s ‘name’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-30" id="footnote-265-30-backlink">18</a></span></p>
				<p class="a-head">IV</p>
				<p class="text">As Father, Son and Spirit, God is <span class="italic">holy in all his works</span>. God is holy; but God is what God does, and so <span class="italic">God’s holiness is to be defined out of God’s works</span>. The determining context for talk of God’s holiness is the examination of the ‘economy’ of God’s works. By ‘the economy’, we refer to the comprehensive scope of God’s dealings with creation and humanity – as creator, as saviour, and as the one who will bring his purposes to perfection. The panorama of what the triune God does is the execution of God’s being. And because God’s identity is enacted in his works, theological reflection upon God’s attributes is to proceed on the basis of the given reality of God’s making himself known as the Father, the Son and the Spirit, who stands in relation to the world and is at work in the world as its creator, saviour and perfecter. For the Christian confession, there is no other God than this one; God’s essence and nature, and therefore God’s holiness, are to be perceived here, in God’s works, or they are not perceived at all.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Starting here has especially important consequences for an account of divine holiness. The divine attributes, I have suggested, are ways of offering a gloss on the divine name, an indication of God’s identity as lordly reconciler and redeemer. One rather formal way of making this point would be to say that the attributes of God are what have been called ‘character trait predicates’, that is, ways of talking which ‘call attention to patterns in a person’s behaviour across time’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-31" id="footnote-265-31-backlink">19</a></span> Such predicates are ways of identifying the intentional action of persons; and, in the case of the divine attributes, this means that ‘God will bear these personal attributes as an agent whose identity is made manifest in action’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-32" id="footnote-265-32-backlink">20</a></span> Another, rather more directly dogmatic, way would be to say that the attributes of God articulate the history of God’s conduct towards us:</p>
				<p class="quote">As a description of the divine essence … every predication of God is a short-hand recounting that expresses the divine self-relation on the basis of God’s conduct towards us … Predications of God <span class="italic">identify who</span> God is in that they <span class="italic">describe what</span> God is. Thus, they <span class="italic">recount who and what</span> God is … [T]he basic attributes of the divinity of God are conceptualized on the basis of the fundamental context of the history of God.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-33" id="footnote-265-33-backlink">21</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Holiness is a mode of God’s activity; talk of God’s holiness identifies the manner of his relation to us. For if the word ‘holy’ is a shorthand term for a pattern of activity, if it indicates – as von Rad put it – ‘a relationship more than a quality’, then the holy God is precisely God manifest to humankind in his gracious turning.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-34" id="footnote-265-34-backlink">22</a></span> ‘God’s holiness’, wrote Bavinck, ‘is revealed in his entire revelation to his people, in election, in the covenant, in his special revelation, in his dwelling among them.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-35" id="footnote-265-35-backlink">23</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">What, then, we may ask, is the force of faith’s language of God’s holiness? What particular aspect of the unified identity of the triune God’s being, works and ways is indicated by this language? We may answer thus: Talk of God’s holiness denotes the majesty and singular purity which the triune God is in himself and with which he acts towards and in the lives of his creatures, opposing that which is itself opposed to his purpose as creator, reconciler and perfecter, and bringing that purpose to its completion in the fellowship of the saints. Holiness, because it is the holiness of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ now present in the Spirit’s power, is pure majesty in relation. God’s holy majesty, even in its unapproachableness, is not characterized by a sanctity which is abstract difference or otherness, a counter-reality to the profane; it is a majesty known in turning, enacted and manifest in the works of God. Majesty and relation are not opposed moments in God’s holiness; they are simply different articulations of the selfsame reality. For if God’s relation to us were merely subordinate to his primary majesty, then God’s essence would remain utterly beyond us, forever hidden; and if God’s relation to us were not majestic, then that relation would no longer be one in which we encountered God. An essential condition, therefore, for making dogmatic sense of God’s holiness is to avoid the polarizing of majesty and relation; the divine distance and the divine approach are one movement in God’s being and act.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-36" id="footnote-265-36-backlink">24</a></span> In short: the holiness manifest in the works of the majestic triune God is manifest as <span class="italic">personal, moral relation</span>, as a relation between the persons of the Holy Trinity and the creatures whom God summons into holy fellowship with himself.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-37" id="footnote-265-37-backlink">25</a></span> One immediate corollary here is that the familiar distinctions between the absolute or metaphysical and relative or personal attributes of God can have only limited application. When deployed to best advantage, those distinctions attempt to maintain that God is free in relation to the creation, and that God’s freedom is precisely his freedom for relation. But the distinctions can quickly become vicious, if they are allowed to erode the coherence of God’s being <span class="italic">ad intra</span> and his being <span class="italic">ad extra</span>, or to drive a wedge between the essence and the existence of God, by suggesting that there are <span class="italic">non-relational</span> (metaphysical) divine attributes. The attribute of holiness is particularly difficult to assimilate into the absolute–relative scheme, whose severe limitations it thereby exposes. For like an absolute attribute, holiness stresses the divine transcendence; and like a relative attribute, holiness also draws attention to God’s work as the world’s creator, reconciler and sanctifier. Holiness is thus a telling illustration of the twofold rule articulated by Martensen: ‘[t]here are no divine attributes, which … do not express a relation of God to the world’; and ‘there are no divine attributes … which do not go back on God himself’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-38" id="footnote-265-38-backlink">26</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">God <span class="italic">is</span> holy, and therefore holiness characterizes all God’s ways; in all that he does he is holy, and can no more not be holy than he can not be God. As all God’s ways are merciful and true; as all his ways are the exercise of his omnipotence; so all God’s ways are holy. Holiness pervades all God’s works; it is what Aulén calls ‘the background and the atmosphere of the conception of God’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-39" id="footnote-265-39-backlink">27</a></span> The pervasiveness of holiness in all talk of God has led some to suggest that holiness ought not to be treated as a separate attribute, taking its place in a sequential exposition of all the divine perfections, but rather should be expounded first as what it is, an ingredient within all God’s attributes.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-40" id="footnote-265-40-backlink">28</a></span> The dogmatic instinct here is a sound one, and organizing the material in this way is not without its advantages. Nevertheless, the instinct needs to be followed with some caution, above all lest it lead to an assimilation of holiness to divine aseity, once again compromising not only the relational character of the holiness of the holy Trinity, but also the identity of God’s being in se with his turning to us. As Cremer puts the matter: ‘Through the revelation of God’s holiness, the real deity of God becomes truly revealed … [Holiness] is the decisive attribute for knowing and acknowledging God and for understanding his will and action; on this attribute, all other knowledge of the attributes of God depends. If the holiness of God is not perceived and understood, then the entire work and conduct of God are not grasped.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-41" id="footnote-265-41-backlink">29</a></span></p>
				<p class="a-head">V</p>
				<p class="text">As Father, Son and Spirit, God is <span class="italic">the Holy One in our midst, establishing, maintaining and perfecting righteous fellowship with the holy people of God</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To sum up so far: God the Holy Trinity is known in his turning to us, and so to speak of God’s holiness is to speak on the basis of his majestic self-communicative and saving presence. God the Holy One is the Holy One <span class="italic">in our midst</span>. The crucial consequence of this for how we think about the holiness of God is that the idea of God’s holiness is a <span class="italic">relational</span> concept. That is to say, what it articulates is the origin, manner and goal of the relation in which God stands to his creation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In highlighting the relational character of God’s triune holiness, we are not subjectivizing this attribute, translating it into a way of talking about ourselves and our way of experiencing and relating to God. To say that would be to fall into some of the snares that have entangled accounts of God’s attributes in Western theology since the great early-nineteenth-century Reformed theologian Schleiermacher. ‘All attributes which we ascribe to God are to be taken as denoting not something special in God, but only something special in the manner in which the feeling of absolute dependence is to be related to Him.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-42" id="footnote-265-42-backlink">30</a></span> Schleiermacher’s famous definition is intended to deny what he calls the ‘speculative character’ of the divine attributes and to restore their soteriological import.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-43" id="footnote-265-43-backlink">31</a></span> Yet this indisputably praiseworthy undertaking quickly unravels. For where Schleiermacher was cautiously referential, his heirs have often become nominalist, even sceptical. When the divine attributes become primarily ways of characterizing religious apprehensions of the divine, apprehensions filled out culturally and experientially, then God’s own being is at best left indefinite, and at worst becomes a blank, a void which we then have busily to fill with ideas of our own invention. Over against this, talk of God’s holiness does indeed indicate God’s being. But because it indicates the being of <span class="italic">this </span>God, the triune God of the Christian confession, it speaks, not of God in abstraction from us, but of God’s presence as the one who turns to us in mercy and grace. God’s holiness is made known to us in the way in which, as Father, Son and Spirit, God enters into relation with us and deals with us as creator, saviour and sanctifier. This relation – this turning, this merciful movement of God in which in utter freedom the holy God does indeed direct himself towards us – is the place where God manifests himself to us, and so the place where his being is made known. The holy God is who he is in his works, and his works are his directing of himself to us as creator, saviour and sanctifier. On the basis of a consideration of these works – and only on that basis – we are to discern the holiness of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is difficult to overstress the importance of this relational character for grasping the nature of God’s holiness. It is fatally easy to think of God’s holiness simply as a mode of God’s sheer otherness and transcendence – that is, as the opposite of relational; as concerned, not with God <span class="italic">with</span> us, but with God <span class="italic">apart from</span> us. But to follow that path is radically to misunderstand the biblical testimony. The holiness of God is not to be identified simply as that which distances God from us; rather, God is holy precisely as the one who in majesty and freedom and sovereign power bends down to us in mercy. God is the Holy One. But he is the Holy One ‘in your midst’, as Hosea puts it (Hos. 11.9); or as Isaiah puts it: ‘great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel’ (Isa. 12.6).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Consequently, God’s holiness is not simply to be associated with his transcendence, but equally with his condescension. Put another way: God’s transcendence is not different from or other than the freedom in which the holy God condescends to move towards the world and humankind. In particular, it is important to maintain that God’s holiness is inseparable from the fact that God is the covenant God. God is the Holy One <span class="italic">of Israel</span>, which means to say that God is holy precisely in calling a people to be his own people, in purifying them, and in maintaining them against all threats so that they may be his own possession. Thus the famous imperative in Leviticus – ‘You shall be holy for I the Lord your God am holy’ (Lev. 19.2) – does not envisage God’s holiness simply as God’s distance or utter difference, but rather as that which is known in God’s covenant-creating activity. The same thought is picked up in 1 Pet. 1.15: ‘as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct’. God’s holiness cannot be isolated from God’s calling of a people. God’s holiness is actual as election to covenant, an election which is ever renewed in God’s acts of judgement and reconciliation:</p>
				<p class="quote">The holy God … acts as the one who elects, <span class="italic">the one who draws to himself</span>, the one who establishes fellowship – as the one who brings salvation and gives himself … The wholly Other of the divine holiness finds its most potent expression in the reality that fellowship with him is only possible on the basis of the fact that out of himself and in free love he took to himself the enslaved Israelite tribes.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-44" id="footnote-265-44-backlink">32</a></span> </p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This unbreakable link between holiness and covenant is crucial, because it articulates how God’s holiness is not an abstract and oppositional attribute but a relational one, the ground of the free and merciful relation of the righteous God to his people. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">The holiness of the covenant-creating God cannot be expounded as if it were simply a kind of moral purity that keeps itself aloof from all pollution. There is certainly a half-truth in this notion: moral purity involves separation; there can be no easy fellowship between God and wickedness (and therefore between God’s people and wickedness); God’s holiness means that he is ‘of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on wrong’ (Hab. 1.13). But the half-truth can become a distortion if we fail to see that God’s holiness is much more than rectitude in conformity with an abstract moral law. In his <span class="italic">Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion</span> from the first half of the 1780s, Kant remarks that ‘[r]eason leads us to God as holy legislator,’ for ‘[h]oliness is the absolute or unlimited moral perfection of the will. A holy being must not be affected with the least inclination contrary to morality … So understood, no being but God is holy.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-45" id="footnote-265-45-backlink">33</a></span> But Kant radically misconstrues the dynamic of divine holiness. Partly this is because he makes God into a mere instance of congruity with a moral law external to his being, rather than seeing God as in himself ‘the fountain of all holiness’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-46" id="footnote-265-46-backlink">34</a></span> But it is also because he fails to see that God’s holiness is not primarily morally legislative but soteriological. The dynamic of holiness is that of the history of God’s saving, consecrating presence; holiness as ‘law’ makes sense only in the commonwealth of salvation which that presence establishes. And so, once again, God’s utter separation from wickedness is to be understood within the scope of God’s dealings with humankind. Holiness is not the antithesis of relation – it does not drive God from the unholy and lock God into absolute pure separateness. Rather, God’s holiness is the quality of God’s relation to that which is unholy; as the Holy One, God is the one who does not simply remain in separation but comes to his people and purifies them, making them into his own possession. Talk of God’s holiness indicates the manner in which the sovereign God <span class="italic">relates</span>. As the Holy One, God passes judgement on sin and negates it. Yet the holy God does this, not from afar, as a detached legislator, but in the reconciling mission of the Son and the outpouring of the sanctifying Spirit. That is, God’s destruction of sin is accomplished in his triune acts of <span class="italic">fellowship</span> with humanity, in which he condemns, pardons and cleanses by taking upon himself the situation of the ruined creature, in sovereign majesty exposing himself to our peril and only in that way putting an end to our unholiness. God’s ‘active opposition to sin’ is thus known in the economy of salvation as a ‘unity of judgement and grace’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-47" id="footnote-265-47-backlink">35</a></span> </p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is at just this point that a Christian theological account of the holiness of God will move into discussion of the trinitarian nature of God. The doctrine of the Trinity tells us who God is on the basis of God’s works of creation, salvation and perfection. As such, it is a crucial blockage against a temptation to which all theologies are exposed, namely, that of cramping or truncating the scope of God’s relation to the world, and identifying God with only one mode of relation. On a trinitarian account of the matter, talk of the holiness of God indicates the relation of God to the world which we can discern in the full sweep of his works. Above all, the doctrine of the Trinity prevents abstract accounts of God’s holiness – ‘abstract’ in the sense of being developed apart from attention to the identity of God which is enacted in his threefold repetition of himself in the economy of salvation as Father, Son and Spirit. Thus as Father, God is the one who wills and purposes from all eternity the separation of humankind as a holy people, destined for fellowship with himself. As Son, God is the one who achieves this separation of humankind by rescuing humanity from its pollution and bondage to unholiness. As Spirit, God is the one who completes or perfects that separation by sanctifying humankind and drawing it into righteous fellowship with the holy God. Only such a trinitarian account of the holiness of God can do real justice to the character of divine holiness in its relational character as that which elects, separates and purifies. In effect, what the doctrine of the Trinity does in this context is articulate how God’s holiness is known in his covenant-creating and covenant-sustaining acts. Isaiah repeatedly puts together the ideas of God as the Holy One and God as Redeemer and Saviour (Isa. 41.14; 43.3; 48.17; 49.7): ‘your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel’. God’s holiness is precisely that which is made known in his mercy, in his coming to the aid of his people, in his taking up their cause, in his bearing their sin, in his purifying of them and in his binding them to his own life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">All this, in short, is what is meant by the statement: As Father, Son and Spirit, God is the Holy One in our midst, establishing, maintaining and perfecting righteous fellowship with the holy people of God. This is what might be termed ‘positive’ divine holiness – holiness in its sanctifying aspect. It is within this context that we may most fittingly proceed to discuss what can be termed ‘negative’ holiness, that is, holiness as a purity which is destructive of wickedness. God’s holiness is the undeflected purposiveness with which God ensures that his will for humankind will not be spoiled by wickedness. As the Holy One, the triune God is at work to ensure that the end of the human creature – what we have called ‘righteous fellowship with God’ – will be attained, and sin will not be allowed to lead to the creature’s ruin and destruction. God’s holiness is thus inseparable from his covenant faithfulness – his undefeated determination that the creature will flourish and reach its end. Part of that determination is the opposition of God’s holiness to that which is unholy. The unholy is that which lies beyond the will of God. The unholy is the absurd affair in which the creature seeks to be creature in a way other than that which is purposed by God; it is, therefore, a way in which the creature – precisely by trying to cease to be a creature and to make itself – seeks to destroy itself. To this unholiness the holiness of God is implacably opposed. But we may not isolate this moment of opposition; we may not extract it from the larger scope of God’s dealings with humankind and make it into the only feature of the landscape. To do that would be to miss the real point of talk of God’s holiness by making it into some theoretical or abstract principle standing in opposition to unholiness, and to fail to see the true end of this negative aspect of God’s holiness. To think of God’s holiness in such terms would be to fail to trace the history of holiness in relation. In that history, God’s holiness figures itself as the righteous will of the Father for the creature, which is embodied in the Son’s work of sin-bearing and reconciliation, and extended into us in the Spirit’s consecration of the reconciled. And it is by that history – not by any general, impersonal concepts of inviolable sanctity – that holy reason is to be instructed in the matter of the holiness of God. God’s negative holiness is the destructive energy of God’s positive holiness; it is the holiness of the triune God who – precisely because he wills to sustain the creature – must obliterate everything which thwarts the creature’s life with God. God’s holiness destroys wickedness for the same reason that we human beings destroy disease: because it attacks the creature’s flourishing and is opposed to our well-being. And as the end of the eradication of disease is health, so the end of the eradication of unholiness is the creature’s consecration, that is, the creature’s wholesome life in righteous fellowship with God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is in this connection that we are to understand, therefore, the link between God’s holiness and God’s jealousy. ‘I the Lord your God am a jealous God’ (Ex. 20.5). It is rather easy to fall into a trap as dogmatics tries to make a conceptual paraphrase of what is being confessed here. Talk of the divine jealousy can project an idolatrous representation of God as a magisterial figure with a considerable sense of his own dignity, one whose self-love is easily wounded; or it can suggest that God is jealous like a wilful child, seeking to possess and control the whole world. But God’s jealousy is not such, because it is the jealousy of the Holy Trinity. The jealousy of God is certainly what Brunner calls ‘an active self-differentiation, the willed energy with which God asserts and maintains the fact that He is Wholly Other against all else’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-48" id="footnote-265-48-backlink">36</a></span> But this ‘willed energy’ of God is not some aseity apart from his directedness to the creature’s cause. It is precisely the energy of the will with which God directs himself in all his works and ways towards us. The jealousy of the triune God is his purposiveness. It is his refusal to negotiate away the creature’s good by allowing the creature itself to set the terms on which it will live. Certainly, God’s jealousy is God’s fierce opposition to all that thwarts God’s will; as the jealous God, God overcomes, and none may stand in his path. But this jealous holiness, precisely in its opposition to and destructiveness of our wickedness, is that which ensures our flourishing. Ezekiel puts it thus: ‘I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name’ (Ezek. 39.25). God’s jealousy is his holiness in his work of restoration and mercy, as we are cleansed by the blood of Jesus (1 Jn 1.7) and sanctified by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit (Tit. 3.5). Just because ‘God’s holiness is his sheer otherness, his sheer difference from everything else … it expresses itself … positively in his establishing of the goodness of the creature that is other than he’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-49" id="footnote-265-49-backlink">37</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">We may draw these threads together by giving a more explicit trinitarian statement of what has been suggested so far about the inseparability of Trinity, holiness and covenant. The Holy Trinity is made known in the work of redeeming and consecrating a holy people. The holy God is God <span class="italic">with</span> us, God <span class="italic">for</span> us. In trinitarian terms, this comes out something like this: God the holy Father is the one who wills a people for himself. The Father’s holiness is thus his work of purposing a people for himself, of securing from all eternity that what Israel and the Church signify will be established, namely, creatures in fellowship with God. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Ephesians tells us, ‘chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him’ (Eph. 1.4). God the holy Son is the one who condescends to turn to the world in grace as its saviour and redeemer. The Son’s holiness is thus his work of rescuing those whom the Father wills for fellowship with himself. It is the merciful friendship with which he comes to the aid of sick and sinful and polluted humanity. It is the holy fellowship in which he takes our place, bears the burden of our sins, and releases us from their contamination. As the Son, the holy God embodies his mercy, redeeming Israel and the Church and, in them, humankind from the threat of sin, remaking what 1 Peter calls ‘a holy nation, God’s own people’ (1 Pet. 2.9). The work of the Son is thus to reconcile us and present us ‘holy and blameless and irreproachable’ before the Father (Col. 1.22). God the Holy Spirit is the one who completes this work of making holy, perfecting the creature by binding the creature’s life into that of Christ and so realizing <span class="italic">in</span> the creature what has been achieved <span class="italic">for </span>the creature. The Spirit’s holiness is thus known in his work of sanctifying. As Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians, ‘you were washed, you were sanctified … in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God’ (1 Cor. 6.11). Who, then, is the holy God? For the Christian confession, he is this one: the thrice Holy One, worshipped in the Apocalypse and in the prayers of the Church thus:</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>who was and is and is to come! (Rev. 4.8)</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Theology as the exercise of holy reason is a paraphrase of that cry of praise. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">That paraphrase cannot be completed, however, without reflection on the work of God in the creatures who give voice to God’s holiness. To round out this trinitarian account of God’s holiness, we will follow through the movement of the communication of God’s holiness to the communion of saints, both in their common life and in their individual lives. ‘[I]t is fit’, says Jonathan Edwards, that ‘as there is an infinite fountain of holiness, moral excellence and beauty, so it should flow out in communicated holiness’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-50" id="footnote-265-50-backlink">38</a></span> To that lofty matter, we shall give ourselves in the next chapter.</p>

R. Swinburne, similarly, elides the force of the notion of holiness as he reduces the divine attributes to their simplest possible form, in which all the divine properties ‘follow from a very simple property which I shall call having pure, limitless, intentional power’: <span class="italic">The Christian God</span>, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994, p. 151; the effect of this formal definition is to factor out the difference which would be made by a material or directional determination of the divine being out of the divine activity.

						<p class="notes"><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-265-36-backlink" id="footnote-265-36">24</a>	From this point of view, questions might be raised about the distinction drawn by Staniloae between holiness as a quality of the Holy Trinity, which is ‘apophatic and undefinable’ and therefore properly called ‘supra-holiness’ (Staniloae, <span class="italic">Orthodox Dogmatic Theology</span>, p. 222), and holiness as a divine relation to creatures. Even though Staniloae does go on to concede that ‘[i]n the holiness manifested in the world the same combination of the transcendent and the revealed, of elevation and condescension in God is revealed’ (p. 222), the difficulty of counter-poising majesty and relation remains unresolved. Similarly, Tillich suggests that holiness as relation is ‘paradoxical’: ‘The unapproachable character of God, or the impossibility of having a relation with him in the proper sense of the word, is expressed in the word ‘holiness’. God is essentially holy, and every relation to him involves the consciousness that it is paradoxical to be related to that which is holy. God cannot become an object of knowledge or a partner in action. If we speak, as we must, of the ego-thou relation between God and man, the thou embraces the ego and consequently the entire relation … Ultimately, it is an insult to the divine holiness to talk about God as we do of objects whose existence or non-existence can be discussed. It is an insult to the divine holiness to treat God as a partner with whom one collaborates or as a superior power whom one influences by rites and prayers. The holiness of God makes it impossible to draw him into the context of the ego-world and the subject-object correlation. He himself is the ground and meaning of this correlation, not an element within it. (Tillich, <span class="italic">Systematic Theology</span>, vol. 1, pp. 271–2)’ But because it is not undergirded by a trinitarian account of the relation of God and creatures, Tillich’s account tends to polarize intrinsic and extrinsic holiness; without an account of the free relatedness of the triune God, its only safeguard against immanentizing divine holiness is the dogmatically bare notion of ‘paradox’. Brunner speaks in similarly abstract terms of ‘the dialectic of Holiness and Love’ (E. Brunner, <span class="italic">The Christian Doctrine of God: Dogmatics</span>, vol. 1, London: Lutterworth Press, 1949, p. 163).</p>

						<p class="notes"><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-265-37-backlink" id="footnote-265-37">25</a>	This relation cannot be stated through the categories of a nonpersonal metaphysics, but requires that the language of personal agency and historical relation be left to stand as irreducible. Izaak Dorner in his (otherwise admirable) treatment of divine holiness in the Old Testament notes that holiness is ‘no mere negative or transcendent attribute of God, but is also of positive value in the realization of the world’ (I. Dorner, <span class="italic">System of Christian Doctrine</span>, Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1880, vol. 1, p. 322); but he goes on (p. 323) to state this communication of holiness in non-personal terms: ‘It creates a new spiritual life by applying its soul, Holiness, to the propagation of itself in the world’ – note how the immediate effect of translating out of the category of personal relation is to elide the distinction (and therefore, of course, the relation) of God and the world. Pannenberg, similarly, adopts a Hegelian framework for articulating divine holiness, suggesting a ‘structural affinity between what the Bible says about the holiness of God and the concept of the true Infinite. The Infinite that is merely a negation of the finite is not yet truly seen as the Infinite (as Hegel showed), for it is defined by delimitation from something else, i.e., the finite … The Infinite is truly infinite only when it transcends its own antithesis to the finite. In this sense the holiness of God is truly infinite, for it is opposed to the profane, yet it also enters the profane world, penetrates it, and makes it holy’ (W. Pannenberg, <span class="italic">Systematic Theology</span>, vol. 1, p. 400). The absence of language of holiness as willed relation is striking here; Pannenberg’s talk of ‘the essence of God as Spirit’ which expresses ‘the fact that the transcendent God himself is characterized by a vital movement which causes him to invade what is different from himself and to give it a share in his own life’ (p. 400) moves in a rather different direction.</p>

It is a fundamental weakness of J. Armstrong’s argument in <span class="italic">The Idea of Holiness and the Humane Response</span>, London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1981, that it fails to discern the tie between holiness and maintenance of the creature’s cause; this failure leads to the claim that in the biblical tradition we find ‘holiness as absolute centralised power’ (p. 15) – what Armstrong terms ‘sacralism’ –and that ‘fully developed holiness licenses, nay demands, holy genocide’ (p. 94). There is a serious question underlying the book’s exegetical and historical absurdities, but its tendentiousness simply obscures its force.</p>
