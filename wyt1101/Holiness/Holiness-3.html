				<p class="text">I first began to ponder the theological concept of holiness in the course of trying to construct a satisfactory account of what it might mean to speak of Scripture as ‘holy’. The occasion to range more widely in the area came with the invitation to deliver the Day–Higginbotham lectures at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, in February 2002. The chapters of this little book are a slight amplification of the texts of those lectures as they were delivered. I am very grateful to the President and faculty of Southwestern for their invitation and their generous welcome, and to the pastors, students and theological teachers who attended the lectures and discussed them with me. I also owe a debt of gratitude to Victor Thasiah for his ready assistance in putting the material into its final form.</p>
