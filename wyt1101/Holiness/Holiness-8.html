				<p class="a-head">I</p>
				<p class="text">The attributes of God are ways of talking of the identity of the triune God, and so, as we have seen, God’s holiness is a trinitarian attribute, characterizing his life as Father, Son and Spirit. The triune God’s identity is enacted in the economy of creation, reconciliation and perfection, in the work in which God is creatively, savingly and communicatively present. God’s holiness is thus a relational attribute, characterizing God’s dealing with that which he has made and redeems. To talk of the holiness of God is to summarize the being and works of the Holy Trinity as God elects, redeems and completes holy fellowship between himself and his people. This is why a dogmatic exposition of the holiness of God has to include within its scope an account of the communication of holiness. This, not in the sense of creaturely holiness as a participation in the triune being of the holy God, nor in the sense of creaturely holiness as an emanation of the divine, but in the sense of God’s unceasing, ever-fresh act of bestowing holiness upon the creature by the creature’s consecration. Communicated holiness is not transferred or possessed holiness, but derived holiness; and the primary mark of creaturely holiness is thus its external orientation, its ordering towards God as its source and the object of its praises.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">So far in our sketch of the communication of holiness we have concentrated upon the common life of holiness, upon God’s people as the<span class="italic"> sanctorum communio</span>. But there is also a proper individuality to holiness, a propriety to giving a dogmatic account of the personal life of the Christian, the saint in Christ. As we shall come to see, this may not be done in such a way as to make the personal or subjective into the real centre around which all our language of the holy Church and the holy God orbits. To follow that path would not only subvert a proper sense that the holiness of the individual Christian occurs within the fellowship of God’s holy people; it would also threaten to collapse the transcendent work of divine election, reconciliation and perfection into the little world of the individual saint. This kind of collapse has, of course, happened often enough in the history of the practice of piety and finds contemporary expression in some kinds of interest in spirituality as self-fulfilment. Nevertheless, the rule holds: <span class="italic">abusus non tollit usum</span>, abuse does not do away with proper use. There is a gospel legitimacy to talk of individual sanctity. For its exposition, all that is required is good dogmatic order, in which sanctity is rooted in an account of the ways of the Holy Trinity and has its context in the communion of the saints. Good dogmatic order will help promote good pastoral order, and so inhibit that inflammation of self-concern which can so afflict the life of piety and frustrate growth in holiness. In brief: what is needed is an orderly theological account of the individual Christian as ‘sanctified in Christ Jesus’ (1 Cor. 1.2). In propositional form, such an orderly account might be summarized thus:</p>
				<p class="quote"><span class="italic">The sanctification of the Christian is the work of the Holy Trinity in which the reconciled sinner is renewed for the active life of holy fellowship with God. Grounded in the electing, reconciling and perfecting work of Father, Son and Spirit, the active life of holy fellowship is the work of faith, which is at every moment characterized by mortification and vivification, and which is actual as freedom, obedience and love.</span></p>
				<p class="a-head">II</p>
				<p class="text">First, then: <span class="italic">The sanctification of the Christian is the work of the Holy Trinity in which the reconciled sinner is renewed for the active life of holy fellowship with God</span>. Whence the miracle of the Christian life? How does it come about that sin is overcome and in its place there arises a new form of life which can be called ‘holy’? How does it arise that a human life is set free from enmity towards God, from disobedience and from hatred of neighbour, and is restored to its proper ends? On what ground does the active life of holy fellowship with God rest? The answer which we must return is simply that the existence and continuation of such a form of life and activity is grounded wholly in the sanctifying work of the Holy Trinity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Sanctification is the Father’s work of election. To say this is to say that the active life of holy fellowship does not originate in any human decision or determination, but rests on a divine determination of utter gratuity and sovereign freedom. Sanctification is ingredient within the eternal resolve of God, and so what was said of the Church must also be said of the individual Christian: ‘He chose us in him [Christ] before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy’ (Eph. 1.4). In talking of the active life of holy fellowship, we are not in the sphere of human decision. Our thinking about sanctification would be disorderly if we were to suggest that, although in the matter of reconciliation we have to talk of a divine determination, when we move to speak of human holiness we are required to shift to talk of our own agency, perhaps co-operating with God, perhaps rendering God his due in return for the gift of salvation. But, if we are elected to holiness, then we have been extracted from the sphere of human autonomy; the Christian’s holiness does not stem from the Christian’s decision. However, there is an important complementary truth here: election is election to a way of life. The condition of ‘being elect’ is not simply a state but a history; election to holiness is not merely segregation. Rather, election is determination, appointment to be and to act in a certain way. The movement of segregation is, certainly, indispensable, for consecration means difference. But segregation cannot be made absolute; what is established by God’s election of grace is not a state, but the consecration of the sinner for active service of God:</p>
				<p class="quote">[P]ractice is the aim of that eternal election which is the first ground of the bestowment of all true grace. Good practice is not the ground of election … But Christian practice is the scope and end of election. Though God does not elect men because he foresees that they will live holy, yet he elects them that they may live holy.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-67" id="footnote-265-67-backlink">1</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Sanctification is the Son’s work of reconciliation. If we ask again the question: ‘Whence the miracle of human holiness?’, then alongside the answer that it has its origin in divine election we also have to say that sanctification is inseparable from God’s reconciling work. The work of sanctification, resolved by the Father, is accomplished in the person and mission of the Son of God, the incarnate one, the strangely triumphant sin-bearer in whose blood we have redemption and the forgiveness of our trespasses. At its simplest: holiness rests on the foundation of forgiveness and reconciliation. This is what is meant by saying that the Christian is ‘sanctified … in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ’ (1 Cor. 6.11).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It has become customary in Protestant dogmatics and ethics to secure this christological and soteriological point by insisting on a strictly sequential relationship between justification and sanctification: whatever is said about sanctification has to rest on the priority of the justifying work of Christ. Particularly in polemic against what were taken to be synergistic Roman Catholic accounts of the matter, the insistence upon rooting sanctification in justification through faith alone took to its full conclusion a sense of the radical character of God’s saving grace. The move from justification to sanctification does not entail any compromise of the perfection and sufficiency of grace which is declared in the Word and assented to in faith. Sanctification rests on the divine act of salvation accomplished in the death and resurrection of the Son and pronounced in the gospel promulgation of acquittal. Consequently, the agent of Christian holiness is not the Christian but God. In effect, the rooting of sanctification in justification prohibits any conversion of sanctification into ethical self-improvement, as if justification were merely an initial infusion of capacities which are then activated through moral or spiritual exertion. Moreover, tying sanctification so firmly to divine agency enters a protest against exemplarist accounts of the atonement in which the work of Christ is reduced to the mere occasion, stimulus or pattern for the Christian’s efforts to become holy through works of holiness. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet however decisive the backward reference of sanctification to justification, we may legitimately ask whether more needs to be maintained at this point if we are not to fall victim to a certain narrowness, a constriction of the scope of the Son’s saving work. Two matters call for comment. First, without closer specification, insistence upon the centrality of justification for any account of sanctification may engender a certain abstraction of the work of the Son from his person, isolating the paschal events from the person and agent who is at their centre and, in effect, threatening to drift into a functionalist Christology in which the saviour’s person is a mere function of his saving activity. This need not happen; indeed, any serious account of justification will want to resist rather strenuously any bifurcation of the Son’s person and the Son’s work. But that resistance will entail a reluctance to allow the motif of justification so to inflate itself that it bears the whole weight of the Son’s work of reconciliation. Second, therefore, justification cannot be expected to function as a comprehensive summary for the reconciling work of the Son, but must be integrated into the wider sweep of the saving economy of God, which stretches from eternity to eternity, and whose centre is not justification alone, but the person and mission of the Son in its entirety – from his submission to the Father’s will, through the assumption of flesh, the obedience and humiliation of incarnate existence, the proclamation and enactment of the kingdom of God, the giving of himself to death, the exaltation at resurrection and ascension to glory at the Father’s right hand, and the continuing work as prophet, priest and king. It is that mission in its full compass, and not any single phase within it, which constitutes the achievement of our sanctification; only in that full compass do we have the enactment of the ‘name’ of Jesus Christ in which we are made holy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What, then, does it mean that in this ‘name’ the Christian is sanctified? Simply this: Jesus Christ is the Holy One who makes holy. In the movement of his being as Son and Word made flesh, in his person and mission as ‘the Holy One of God’ (Mk 1.24), Jesus Christ sanctifies. By his existence and action, by the fact that he is the one whom the Father has consecrated (Jn 10.36), Jesus Christ makes holy. He does not only acquit, but, in acquitting, he consecrates, renewing humankind’s vocation to be holy before God. He does not accomplish this in his person in isolation or in his work in isolation, for any such distinctions fail to catch the unitary identity of the person of the incarnate one. He sanctifies because as the one who assumes human nature he is in our place, and acts in our place, making us – not merely potentially, but actually – holy, consecrated to God. God made him our sanctification; to be a saint is to have one’s holiness in Christ Jesus.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We ask again: ‘Whence the miracle of human holiness?’, and alongside our reference to the Father’s work of election and the incarnate Son’s work of reconciliation, we must return a third answer: we are sanctified ‘in the Spirit of our God’ (1 Cor. 6.11). The Holy Spirit is God himself active in ‘realizing’ or ‘perfecting’ the sanctification that is determined by the Father’s creative will and established by the reconciling person and work of the Son. By the personal operation of the Spirit, that which God wills and accomplishes with sovereign freedom and effectiveness comes to be the actual condition of the Christian’s existence: no longer an abstract state of affairs but an objective reality which gathers the Christian into itself. ‘In’ the Spirit, elected and accomplished sanctification is made effectual as the Christian’s own most personal reality. God the Holy Spirit is, as Calvin puts it, ‘the secret energy … by which we come to enjoy Christ and all his benefits’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-68" id="footnote-265-68-backlink">2</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is – crucially – not to imprison the Spirit in the realm of human subjectivity. The secret energy of the sanctifying Spirit of God is not another way of talking of our own secret energies, and is not to be conceived as an infused power which stimulates human acts of holiness. To think in such terms would simply be to lose the reference of Christian holiness back to the triune work of grace, and turn sanctification into an acquired sufficiency. The Christian’s sanctity is in Christ, in the Spirit, not in se ; it is always and only an alien sanctity. Sanctification does not signal the birth of self-sufficiency, rather it indicates a ‘perpetual and inherent lack of self-sufficiency’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-69" id="footnote-265-69-backlink">3</a></span> Sanctification ‘in’ the Spirit is not the Spirit’s immanence in the saint. Quite the opposite: it is a matter of the<span class="italic"> externality of sanctitas christiana</span>, the saint being and acting <span class="italic">in another</span>. ‘Sanctification in the Spirit’ means: it is not I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And ‘Christ lives in me’ means: by the Spirit’s power I am separated from my self-caused self-destruction, and given a new holy self, enclosed by, and wholly referred to, the new Adam in whom I am and in whom I act.</p>
				<p class="a-head">III</p>
				<p class="text">All this is by way of stating that an account of the grounds of the holiness of the Christian requires a further extension of the language <span class="italic">sola gratia</span>, a reiteration of the <span class="italic">solus Deus</span> in the matter of the Christian life. How, consequently, is that life to be described? Our proposition continues thus: <span class="italic">Grounded in the electing, reconciling and perfecting work of Father, Son and Spirit</span>, the life for which the Christian is renewed is <span class="italic">the active life of holy fellowship</span> which <span class="italic">is the work of faith.</span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian holiness is holy fellowship; it is the renewal of the relation to God which is the heart of holiness. To be a <span class="italic">creature</span> is to have one’s being in relation to God, for ‘to be’ is ‘to be in relation’ to the creator, and only so to have life and to act. To be a sinner is to repudiate this relation, and so absolutely to imperil one’s life by seeking to transcend creatureliness and become one’s own origin and one’s own end. This wicked refusal to be a creature cannot overturn the objectivity of the creator’s determination to be God with us, for such is the creator’s mercy that what he has resolved from all eternity stands fast. But the sinner’s failure to live in acknowledgement of the creator’s gift of life means that the creature chooses to torment and damage his being to the point of ruin, precisely by struggling out of the ordered relation to God in which alone the creature can be. To be a <span class="italic">reconciled sinner</span> is to be one in whom God’s mercy has put an end to self-destruction, one whose enmity has been authoritatively and irrevocably overruled, and one therefore restored to life in relation to God. And, therefore, to be a <span class="italic">saint</span> is to be a reconciled sinner, re-established in fellowship and so liberated and empowered for the works of holiness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the divine work of sanctification, then, the creature is reintegrated into the movement of God’s history with us, the history of active fellowship: though formerly the sinner struggled against that history and defied its Lord, now the sinner is consecrated to free and glad engagement with God. The older Protestant divines spoke of this in terms of the restoration of the image of God: the <span class="italic">terminus a quo</span> of sanctification is the corruption of the divine image, and sanctification’s <span class="italic">terminus ad quem</span> is its restoration.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-70" id="footnote-265-70-backlink">4</a></span> Language about the <span class="italic">imago Dei</span> can, of course, rather easily become excessively static, especially when the image is located in some human faculty such as reason or conscience, often with the purpose of furnishing a natural anthropological basis for talk of God. In view of this, it is perhaps wiser to conceive of the renewal of human nature ‘after the image of its creator’ (Col. 3.10) in terms which are as broad and as historical as possible: <span class="italic">anakainōsis</span> is the resumption of the history of fellowship between God and his creatures after the vile episode of sin; it is our comprehensive reintegration into the holy covenant by the mercy of the holy God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">On the side of the Christian, this fellowship which constitutes sanctification is the renewal of the active life of obedience. A passage near the beginning of Calvin’s account of justification runs thus:</p>
				<p class="quote">Christ was given to us by God’s generosity, to be grasped and possessed by faith. By partaking of him, we principally receive a double grace: namely, that being reconciled to God through Christ’s blamelessness, we may have in heaven instead of a Judge a gracious Father; and secondly, that sanctified by Christ’s Spirit we may cultivate blamelessness and purity of life.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-71" id="footnote-265-71-backlink">5</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">In speaking of the reconciling work of God as a ‘double grace’, Calvin envisages the divine presence which encounters humankind in the gospel as the restoration of peace with God through divine acquittal, and as sanctification for active purity. Reconciled to God by God, we are made holy for the works of holiness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This means that the works of holiness emerge from the convulsion and reorientation of human being and activity by God. In talking of what Calvin calls the ‘cultivation’ of blamelessness and purity of life, we do not fall back into self-realization: to that perversion of our creatureliness, God has uttered a final ‘No’ at the cross. Christian holiness is a matter of ‘evangelical sanctification’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-72" id="footnote-265-72-backlink">6</a></span> – of the holiness that the gospel <span class="italic">declares</span> and to which the creaturely counterpart is <span class="italic">faith</span>. Christian holiness is life in the space created by the presence of God’s holiness through the reconciling Son and the consecrating Spirit. This is why ‘we can … speak truly of sanctification only when we have understood the exceptionally great significance of the bond of <span class="italic">sola fide</span> and sanctification’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-73" id="footnote-265-73-backlink">7</a></span> Or, in Calvin’s terms: sanctification is an aspect of the divine ‘generosity’, the grasping and possessing of which can only be ‘in faith’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The significance of <span class="italic">sola fide</span> in this context is, quite simply, immense. Not only does it underline the utter priority of grace, it also necessitates the development of a distinctive anthropology. For, if <span class="italic">sola fide</span> is the bass note of Christian holiness, then the explication of that holiness requires an ontology of the human person, and consequently a psychology and an ethics, in which the being of the Christian is not made but given. To be, and therefore to be holy, is to be an implicate of the creative and saving purposes of the triune God. Christian holiness is thus an aspect of the eschatological character of reconciled humanity. To be human in holy fellowship with God is to be granted one’s being in the history of the triune God with us. In that history, the old, self-enclosed and polluted existence has been and is continually set aside, and a new existence opened up, a holy existence of fellowship with the Holy One. This new holy existence is ‘eschatological’ in that it emerges from the comprehensive overthrowing and reordering of human life and history which is called regeneration; and to that regenerative divine act there corresponds faith.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">However, evangelical sanctification is not only the holiness that the gospel <span class="italic">declares</span> but also the holiness that the gospel <span class="italic">commands</span>, to which the creaturely counterpart is <span class="italic">action</span>. Holiness is indicative; but it is also imperative; indeed, it is imperative <span class="italic">because </span>it is the indicative holiness of the triune God whose work of sanctification is directed towards the renewal of the creature’s active life of fellowship with him. Indicative holiness is no mere inert state in which we find ourselves placed and which requires nothing of us beyond passive acquiescence. Indicative holiness is the revelation of the inescapable conclusion under which our lives have been set – namely, that as those elected, justified and sanctified by the mercy of God, we are equally those who are determined for the active life of holiness. Because grace is ‘double grace’, it is election to activity. Double grace is always, of course, wholly <span class="italic">grace</span>; the active life of holiness is never apart from faith’s assent to God’s sheer creativity. But in a Christian theology of the holy life, grace is <span class="italic">duplex</span>, extending into the generation, evocation and preservation of action. ‘Grace’ – which is, of course, nothing other than a shorthand term for the great history of God’s mercy, at whose centre is the passion and resurrection of Christ and his sending of the Spirit – is the gift of <span class="italic">life</span>, and life is active holiness in company with the holy God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is for this reason that it is very important not to isolate the motif of <span class="italic">sola fide </span>by making it into an absolute moment into which the entire moral psychology of the Christian collapses. The result of such isolation is always a drastic foreshortening of the life of Christian holiness, one which resists moralism by striking ethics from the gospel. This may be done under the banner of the doctrine of justification by grace through faith; but its result is a monism of justification that can scarcely hope to give an adequate account of the scope of the triune economy of grace. However indispensable <span class="italic">sola fide</span> may be, it should not be taken to mean that passivity is the only mode of Christian existence. <span class="italic">Sola fide </span>means that in all its acts, the being of the sanctified sinner refers to the lordly creativity of God – to the Father’s electing mercy before all time, the Son’s finished work, and the Spirit’s presence and promise. Faith is ingredient within all holy activity; without faith such activity could not be holy. But faith has its setting in the entire economy of salvation, whose end is our renewal.</p>
				<p class="a-head">IV</p>
				<p class="text">This active life of holy fellowship is <span class="italic">at every moment characterized by mortification and vivification</span>. As mortification, holiness is the laying aside of that which has been put to death at the cross of the Son of God; as vivification, holiness is the living out of that which has been made alive in the Son’s resurrection. Mortification is thus a way of articulating how the new active life of the Christian succeeds and corresponds to the slaying of the old, death-laden existence of ‘trespasses and sins’. Vivification speaks of the active life as corresponding to the great Easter reality: ‘You he made alive!’ (Eph. 2.1). Mortification and vivification, properly conceived, are not two separate acts, but the same reality differently viewed. Nor are mortification and vivification themselves distinct acts, distinguishable from other works of the Christian; rather, they are characteristics of all the patterns of activity that comprise the life of holiness. ‘Putting to death’ and ‘putting on’ are not acts alongside, or in addition to, other works; they are the character of the whole, seen in all its parts. Mortification and vivification signify the extension of the baptismal pattern into the life of the Christian, so that Christ’s dying and rising, in – not despite – all their objectivity and perfection, are the shape of the Christian’s own personal history. To live in the power and light of his death and resurrection, and under its tutelage, is to seek so to act that, in their own sphere and within their own very real limitations, our human lives give answer to grace.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The answer which is given is, depicted in the broadest terms, a laying aside of that which has already been abolished, and a living out of that which has no less definitively been established in the work of salvation. Of all the masters of the Reformation tradition, it is to Calvin that we must turn here once more, for he is the theologian of sanctification <span class="italic">par excellence</span>. In one of the many memorable passages in Book III of the <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, he writes:</p>
				<p class="quote">Now the great thing is this: we are consecrated and dedicated to God in order that we may thereafter think, speak, meditate, and do, nothing except to his glory …</p>
				<p class="quote-second-para">If we, then, are not our own but the Lord’s, it is clear what error we must flee, and whither we must direct all the acts of our life. We are not our own: let not our reason nor our will, therefore, sway our plans and deeds. We are not our own: let us therefore not set it as our goal to seek what is expedient for us according to the flesh. We are not our own: in so far as we can, let us therefore forget ourselves and all that is ours.</p>
				<p class="quote-second-para">Conversely, we are God’s: let us therefore live for him and die for him. We are God’s: let his wisdom and will therefore rule all our actions. We are God’s: let all the parts of our life accordingly strive toward him as our only lawful goal. O, how much has that man profited who, having been taught that he is not his own, has taken away dominion and rule from his own reason that he may yield it to God! For, as consulting our self-interest is the pestilence that most effectively leads to our destruction, so the sole haven of salvation is to be wise in nothing and to will nothing through ourselves but to follow the leading of the Lord alone.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-74" id="footnote-265-74-backlink">8</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">What is the ‘great thing’ to which Calvin seeks to turn his readers’ minds? The fact that our ‘consecration’ by God is <span class="italic">purposive</span> (‘in order that …’); that we are sanctified<span class="italic"> by</span> God to God; that the human end of the divine work of sanctification is that human reason, speech and action should be to the glory of God alone. From this there flows what Calvin sees as the twofold movement of the Christian life, a movement rooted in the twofold condition in which the Christian is placed. The condition is that, first, ‘we are not our own’, and, second, that we are ‘the Lord’s’. That is, negatively, in Christian existence we are irrevocably denied the right claimed by the sinner to selfpossession and self-actualization, because, positively, we are possessed and made real by God. More briefly: our condition is one that denies our desire to be God to ourselves, because we have been created and recreated by the one true God. From this holy condition arises the movement of holy living, a movement which is at one and the same time an abandonment, a flight from falsehood and a turning – a directing of ourselves to the God in whom we <span class="italic">are</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Mortification entails what Calvin goes on to describe as selfabandonment. ‘Let this therefore be the first step, that a man depart from himself.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-75" id="footnote-265-75-backlink">9</a></span> Of course, for Calvin this does not mean that the holy life spells the end of selfhood, but rather its extraction from the realm of wickedness, idolatry and rebellion. Reason and will are to be chastened, indeed mortified, not because their exercise is in and of itself depraved, but because they must be ordered away from self-chosen ends and so reenter the service of God. This ‘service’, emptying human powers of their ‘carnal’ abuse, means ‘obedience to God’s Word’ and a deference to the ‘bidding of God’s Spirit’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-76" id="footnote-265-76-backlink">10</a></span> This is what Calvin, picking up an ancient theme, calls ‘Christian philosophy’ – wisdom for true human living in relation to God. It is chiefly known as giving place to God, submission and subjection which corresponds to the fact that the inflamed, proud, competent self, full of that jumble of desire and anxiety which is the sinner’s grief, has been killed at the cross, and so can, and must, be abandoned.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Mortification, the older Protestant divines insisted, is not mere fleshly sorrow. It is quite other than the destructive misery we feel at the ruin which we have brought upon ourselves, which so quickly becomes self-hatred and hatred of God. Mortification is not despair in the face of the insolubility of our situation. Its dynamic is entirely different, for it is a turning away from that which has already been decisively dealt with by God in his reconciling work. Mortification is only possible because, at the cross, we ‘have died’, and because, by virtue of the resurrection, our life is ‘hid with Christ in God’ (Col. 3.3). Mortification is not hopeless self-accusation, but the setting aside of sin which can be undertaken and must be undertaken because sin has already been set aside. What characterizes mortification is thus not the frustrated rage of self-recrimination, but a horror at sin which flows from absolution, and a resolve to live out the release which God has won for us. Mortification, in other words, is inseparable from vivification, the <span class="italic">quickening</span> of life and activity which the gospel announces and to which we conform by directing ‘all the acts of our life’ towards the Lord.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-77" id="footnote-265-77-backlink">11</a></span> <span class="italic">Sumus Domini</span> – We are the Lord’s – is the great evangelical declaration that stands over the entirety of the life of Christian holiness. In it is set before us the fact that election has been fulfilled in reconciliation and perfected in the Spirit; by it, repentance is made possible as that truthful turn from the shadow of sin towards the light of life.</p>
				<p class="a-head">V</p>
				<p class="text">The active life of holy fellowship with God has mortification and vivification as its deep structure. That life is, finally, <span class="italic">actual as freedom, obedience and love</span>. The saint is one who is set free by God from sin and for reality; emancipated for obedience to the law which is God’s moral truth for his creatures; and liberated for acts of love towards the neighbour in which human fellowship is preserved.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Holiness’ and ‘freedom’ are correlative terms: my sanctification is my emancipation. How is this so? Holiness is consecration by the work of the triune God in which I am set apart for service. By God’s sanctifying grace I am rescued from the clutches of sin and death, and restored to life with the holy God. Holiness is restored covenant fellowship. That restored fellowship is, we must now see, both the root and the context of liberty. In fellowship with God, in the saints’ communion with Father, Son and Spirit, we are given the strange gift of evangelical freedom. And in fellowship with God we are to exercise the freedom for which, according to the gospel, Christ has set us free.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But what is this strange gift of evangelical freedom? It is a <span class="italic">strange</span> gift because it can only be known and exercised as we are converted from a lie – the lie that liberty is unformed and unconstrained self-actualization. It is <span class="italic">evangelical</span> because it is grounded in the joyful reversal and reconstitution of the human situation of which the gospel speaks. We may define it thus: In evangelical freedom I am so bound to God’s grace and God’s call that I am liberated from all other bonds and set free to live in the truth. ‘The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death’ (Rom. 8.2). Freedom is inseparable from the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. That is, in the mystery of the Son’s achievement, present in the Spirit’s power, I am faced with a new, incontrovertible and omnipotent reality – the reality of salvation which says that I am ‘<span class="italic">alive </span>because of righteousness’ (Rom. 8.10). This reality is ‘law’ in the sense that it is a given truth which determines my present and future and forms my action. But as such, it is also the ground of my freedom, for in it is established the fact that I have been set free from another law, ‘the law of sin and death’, emancipated from self-destruction for life in reality.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Evangelical freedom cannot be divorced from the holy fellowship with God of which it is an aspect. Fellowship with God is both its basis and the sphere of its exercise. Drawn by the divine mercy into holy fellowship, I am bound to God – I am, in Paul’s terms, a slave of Jesus Christ, my autonomy at last broken. But bondage to Christ is not the antithesis of my freedom, quite the reverse: it is its essential condition. Why? Because the Christ to whom I am bound is the one who has finally secured the fact that no other power can come between me and my flourishing. In him, God has set a distance between me and all other bonds in which I find myself, and that distance is ‘the distance of freedom’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-78" id="footnote-265-78-backlink">12</a></span> Evangelical freedom is thus freedom from the powers that inhibit me (including, and especially, my own powers). To live the active life of holy fellowship with God is, therefore, to live out of the event of freedom from sin and death. Evangelical freedom is the freedom that comes from not being finally responsible for my own being; by the mercy of God I am restored to know myself to be a creature in fellowship with my creator and saviour. And to such freedom I cannot liberate myself: self-liberation is precisely the ‘yoke of slavery’ (Gal. 5.1) from which I have been set free.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Liberated and protected in this way, I am set free to live in the truth. Modern accounts of freedom identify freedom as unfettered liberty for self-creation, and therefore contrast freedom and nature: freedom is the antithesis of the given, a move against and beyond any sense that I have a determinate identity. Evangelical freedom, by contrast, does not envisage being human as an utterly original making of life and history. Rather, to be human is to live and act in conformity to the given truth (nature) of what I am – a creature of grace, a reconciled sinner and caught up in the movement of the ways and works of God in which I am pointed to a perfection to be revealed in the last times. I am free as I find myself finally unencumbered by idolatry, false desire and vanity, and therefore enabled to fill out, actively to occupy and expand the role to which I am appointed. In evangelical freedom I am set free for reality, and thus for the practices of holiness. From this point of view, the polarization of freedom and obedience that is endemic in modern anthropology is part of the pathology of the modern spiritual history of the self. In the freedom given to me in Christ, I am bound to God’s grace. But God’s grace is God’s call; the holiness with which God consecrates is also a command. And so freedom involves conformity to the law. I am, in short, ‘sanctified … for obedience’ (1 Pet. 1.2).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The form of the active life is law. Some Christian instincts may initially prompt us to wariness at this point. We may fear the use of the law as a means of acquiring righteousness, as it were behind God’s back, through ‘works of the law’; or we may associate the law with mere formality and externalism in morals and religion that leaves the affections untouched. Law, certainly, may be an instrument of self-justification, or of decadent legalism. But properly – that is, evangelically – defined, law is the shape of the life which God commands of the elect. The degenerate use of the law can be countered only by integrating it into the covenant of grace which is the history of holiness. Abstracted from that covenant, law is certainly in league with sin and death; but within the drama of God’s saving work, law is the given order of life, the trajectory along which our moral histories move. This is what is meant by the <span class="italic">usus didacticus </span>of the law: the law is a teacher, not a magistrate, instructing us in the way of holiness which flows from and corresponds to the goodness of God. Law rests on election and reconciliation; there is no retraction of grace here, and the recital of the law must always be prefaced by the words of God’s liberating mercy: ‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage’ (Ex. 20.2). But the promise of grace engenders obedience. Holy obedience has two moments: teachableness and active service, a hearing and a doing of the will of God by which the reason, the affections and the will are all engaged in the service of the Holy One:</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes;</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>and I will keep it to the end.</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Give me understanding, that I may keep thy law</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>and observe it with my whole heart.</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>Lead me in the path of thy commandments,</p>
				<p class="quote-HI"><span class="hidden"> </span>for I delight in it. (Ps. 119.33–35)</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">On the petition ‘Give me understanding’, Calvin comments thus:</p>
				<p class="quote">We are here informed that true wisdom consists in being wise according to the law of God, that it may preserve us in fear and obedience to him. In asking God to confer this wisdom upon him, he owns that men, in consequence of their natural blindness, aim at anything rather than this. And, indeed, it is quite foreign to the notions usually prevalent among mankind to strain every nerve to keep God’s law … For himself he asks no other prudence than the surrendering of himself entirely to God’s direction.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-79" id="footnote-265-79-backlink">13</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Freedom and obedience are thus both basic to the active life of holiness because they direct us outwards, away from sinful selfregard and towards life in the truth of God’s law. It is for that reason that a portrait of the holy life can be completed by speaking of love alongside freedom and obedience. Liberated from wilful and fearful self-seeking, I am consecrated for works of love. Sanctification by God involves the restoration of society. For if evangelical freedom means my emancipation for the truth, and if evangelical obedience means my freedom to act within the righteous order of truth, then love is the free obedience in which I acknowledge my neighbour’s cause and make it my own. Fellowship with God entails human fellowship. In the sphere of holiness, my neighbour is no longer a threat or an obstacle, nor a function of my self-interest. My neighbour is the presence to me of a truth which obliges me to act in his or her regard. Love, like freedom and obedience, involves mortification and vivification. Love is a counter-movement to our ruinous pride. ‘[T]here is no-one who does not cherish within himself some opinion of his own pre-eminence … each individual, by flattering himself, bears a kind of kingdom in his breast.’<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-80" id="footnote-265-80-backlink">14</a></span> That is why, Calvin continues, ‘[u]nless you give up all thought of self, and, so to speak, get out of yourself, you will accomplish nothing here’.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-81" id="footnote-265-81-backlink">15</a></span> That giving up and getting out of self is mortification, and to it there corresponds the quickening of our regard for our fellows. Both dying to self and rising to love of neighbour are the fruits of the Spirit, perfecting in us the holiness for which we have been set apart by God. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">Love involves my acknowledgement that I am <span class="italic">obliged</span> by my neighbour as a reality given to me by God, a reality which I would often like to evade but which encounters me with a transcendent imperative force. Why is this ‘transcendent’ ground for works of human fellowship theologically decisive? Because thereby my neighbour, the one with whom I stand in relation, is given to me, forming part of my destiny in the company of the saints. My neighbour is a summons to fellowship, because in him or her I find a claim on me that is not casual or fortuitous (and thereby dispensable) but rather precedes my will and requires that I act in my neighbour’s regard. Without a sense that fellowship is (God-)given, my neighbour would not present a sufficiently strong claim to disturb me out of complacency and indifference into active, initiative-taking regard. Some basic acts of human fellowship – mercy to strangers, fidelity, patient attentiveness to the unlovely, devotion to long-standing and largely unreciprocated care of the comatose and handicapped – require for their sustenance a perception that the neighbour is one with whom I have been set in fellowship independent of (sometimes against) my will. My neighbour <span class="italic">obliges</span> me because he or she is the presence to me of the appointment and vocation of the holy God. Without givenness, without fellowship as more than a contingent fact, without the neighbour as a divine call, there is only my will. But, if fellowship is a condition and not merely one possibility for my ironic self to entertain, then in building common life – in culture, politics and ethics – I resist the relationlessness of sin into which I may drift, and, sanctified by Christ and Spirit, I realize my nature as one created for holiness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">We may draw these reflections to a close with a remembrance of the great seventeenth-century divine John Owen, who was Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford under Cromwell. Owen was not only the most considerable and prolific English Reformed theologian of his century, intellectually the equal of Hooker or Andrewes or any of the continental scholastic theologians of his period, but also a man of deep spiritual perception: a capacious and discriminating mind broken and remade by love of the gospel. Here, in closing, is what he had to say about what he called God’s ‘holy relations’ to us – that is, of the holiness in which he turns to us: </p>
				<p class="quote">In thoughts of God, his saints rejoice at the remembrance of what he is, and what he will be unto them. Herein have they regard unto all the holy relations that he hath taken on himself towards them, with all the effects of his covenant in Christ Jesus … In these thoughts his saints take sweet delight; they are sweet unto them, and full of refreshment. Thus is it with those who are spiritually minded: they not only think much of God, but they take delight in these thoughts; they are sweet unto them; and not only so, but they have no solid joy nor delight, but in their thoughts of God, which therefore they retreat unto continually … [T]hose who are spiritually minded, will … continually betake themselves unto thoughts of God, wherein they find relief and refreshment against all that they feel and fear. In every state, their principal joy is in the remembrance of his holiness.<span class="note-cue"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-265-82" id="footnote-265-82-backlink">16</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">And so: as Father, God is the one who wills and purposes from all eternity the separation of humankind as a holy people, destined for fellowship with himself. As Son, God is the one who achieves this separation of humankind by rescuing humanity from its pollution and bondage to unholiness. As Spirit, God is the one who completes or perfects that separation by sanctifying humankind and drawing it into righteous fellowship with the holy God. May it be so with us.</p>
