<p class="noindent">The tone of this section is a bit different than the other chapters. It is more deliberately contemplative or meditative. If the prior chapter considers how it is that God blesses us by way of the church that is our home, this chapter attends more to the struggle we have to accept and live in cognizance of these blessings, as those who desire to hold faith. It is out of living mindfully, in relation to our faith, that we are then called by God to live and act in the world as people of hope, as we will discuss in the final section of this book.</p>
<p class="indent">Barth thought a question that should be “addressed to . . . every theologian” is: “How are things with your heart?”<a id="rch8en1" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en1" class="calibre5">1</a></sup> While understanding ourselves as members of the community of believers is crucial to appropriating our identity as God’s beloved children, cognizance that we stand “personally” <a id="page_232" class="calibre7"></a>before God should also be nurtured. Each one of us, Barth thought, is the one whom God makes an “‘I’ by addressing . . . as a ‘Thou.’”<a id="rch8en2" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en2" class="calibre5">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This chapter deals with matters of the heart. But that does not mean it should be treated as an antidote or even a supplement to what comes before or after it. Rather, it explores an essential dimension of what it looks like to live a theological existence.</p>
<p class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="../images/common.jpg" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="indent">We begin with a statement and challenge Kathryn Tanner poses at the start of her book, <em class="calibre8">Jesus, Humanity, and the Trinity</em>: “In order to witness to and be a disciple of Jesus Christ,” she says, “every Christian has to figure out for him or herself what Christianity is all about, what Christianity stands for in the world.”<a id="rch8en3" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en3" class="calibre5">3</a></sup> Over fifty years earlier the teacher of Tanner’s teachers—Karl Barth—had made a similar radical point. Sick and tired of the fact that Christians in Germany baptized their children unthinkingly, as a kind of rite of social passage, Barth had begun advocating for adult baptism. Barth said that infant baptism, as it was practiced in that context, “was one of many symptoms that the church is not alive and bold, that it is afraid to walk on the water like Peter to meet the Lord, and [that it] does not seek a sure foundation but only deceptive props.”<a id="rch8en4" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en4" class="calibre5">4</a></sup> Barth insisted that, if the emphasis were taken off the baptism of children, “every individual would then have to decide whether he or she wanted to be a Christian.”<a id="rch8en5" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en5" class="calibre5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The language of “decision,” “want,” and the church “walking on the water . . . to meet the Lord” might seem quite jarring, coming from a theologian who thinks God, and not humans, initiates and funds every revelatory moment. But Barth was not turning away from a lifetime of commitment to the sovereignty of God, in saying what he did. On the contrary, he recognized that the God known to us in the One who is fully human as well as fully divine includes we who are human in the very act of God’s own self-disclosure. The Word is made flesh, and we enfleshed ones—in and through Jesus Christ—are exalted as “genuine subjects” in the revelatory event.<a id="rch8en6" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en6" class="calibre5">6</a></sup> Our decisions and our wants in the face of God’s living, challenging Word shape the kinds of people we are, and the kinds of <a id="page_233" class="calibre7"></a>communities we form. It is because Barth and his colleagues <em class="calibre8">decided</em> to be Christians; because they acted <em class="calibre8">mindfully, intentionally</em>, and <em class="calibre8">habitually</em> in relation to this decision, that there was a Barmen Declaration, a confessing church movement, and a neo-orthodox renewal of the church.</p>
<p class="indent">The Christian life, simply put, is life lived before God. It is life lived with the awareness that we are known, claimed, called, and sent by the sovereign God who meets us in Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. In this book thus far we have talked about living with the awareness that the God of all things meets us in our creaturely reality, that this God made us and continuously heals and enlivens us, and that this God blesses us in the context of the community of faith, the church. In this chapter, we will consider how God blesses us by shaping in us an awareness of God’s presence, salvation, and gifts. We will gain inspiration, along the way, from biblical forebears who also strove and struggled to hold faith, including Nicodemus, Ruth, Orphah, the saints in Rome, the elder brother from the “parable of the prodigal son” in Luke 15, the sheep from Matthew 25, and Mary the mother of Jesus.<a id="rch8en7" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en7" class="calibre5">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre8">How are things with your heart?</em> To be Christians, ideally, is to live as those who truly know God and know ourselves in relation to God. To live the Christian life is to be so transformed by awareness of the reality in which we participate that our gratitude spills over into faithful actions, contributing to the transformation of the world. To live the Christian life is to see ourselves as God sees us: as beloved children God has made and continues to make by the power of the Spirit; as friends declared righteous in Christ who are called to join as partners in the joyful work of reconciliation.<a id="rch8en8" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en8" class="calibre5">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2">T<small class="calibre3">ROUBLED</small> A<small class="calibre3">WARENESS</small></h3>
<p class="indent">We have spoken candidly throughout this book about the fact that many find holding faith to be challenging. Sometimes it seems, even, an impossibility. And it is difficult not only for skeptics, but for those who have made professions of faith. With Nicodemus, even we who testify to <a id="page_234" class="calibre7"></a>having been “born again” lose sight of our experience of new birth and have difficulty fathoming how we could possibly get from where we are to spiritual renewal. For reasons that may elude us, we are even reticent to engage in practices of faith that we know would be helpful to us, such as Bible study, prayer, and worship participation. How do we get so stuck? What is it that keeps us from being “born again”? What keeps us from living in light of the reality of God’s claim on us?</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes I imagine the challenge of Christian life in relation to the metaphor of a swimming pool (which for me is reminiscent of a baptismal font).<a id="rch8en9" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en9" class="calibre5">9</a></sup> If the water in the pool represents the reality of God’s grace-full presence and salvation, in relation to us, the question is: Why do we spend so much time off to the side of the pool instead of swimming in the water? How do we jump back in, surface, and begin to swim?</p>
<h3 class="h2">J<small class="calibre3">UMP</small>? T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> R<small class="calibre3">ISK OF</small> H<small class="calibre3">OLDING</small> F<small class="calibre3">AITH</small></h3>
<p class="indent">Some of us might be more apt to hold faith if we could simply reach out and take grace without risking a leap into it. As we discussed in <a href="chapter06.xhtml" class="calibre7">chapter 6</a>, discipleship requires we risk putting ourselves to the side in order to see ourselves anew, as God sees us. This poses difficulty for all skeptics who, with Nicodemus, are concerned about taking a leap of faith because they can’t know, before they jump, exactly where they will land. I picture Nicodemus, wanting to engage with Jesus, respecting Jesus but feeling a bit irritated with the line of argument being presented. And so he blurts out a sarcastic question: “Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?”<a id="rch8en10" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en10" class="calibre5">10</a></sup> Now, this is obviously <em class="calibre8">not</em> a real question. Nicodemus <em class="calibre8">knows</em> there will be no climbing back into his mother’s womb. He’s asking this question in an attempt to gain some strength in the conversation. And Jesus is clearly up for this kind of edgy exchange, having a knack for meeting people where they are. “You’re a leader of Israel,” Jesus chides Nicodemus, “and still you don’t understand these things?”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_235" class="calibre7"></a>Sometimes I wish Jesus had been a little easier on Nicodemus. Instead of telling Nicodemus he should “<em class="calibre8">understand these things”</em> Jesus could have told Nicodemus he was trying <em class="calibre8">too hard</em> to understand. <em class="calibre8">To be born from above” is a heart thing—not a head thing</em>, Jesus could have said. <em class="calibre8">To try to understand the mechanics of it is to undermine the process of being reborn by the Spirit</em>. Jesus does say that “the spirit blows where it wills.”<a id="rch8en11" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en11" class="calibre5">11</a></sup> So why doesn’t he simply tell Nicodemus to “let go and let God” rather than challenging him to figure it all out?</p>
<p class="indent">But Jesus refuses to punt on understanding. He scolds Nicodemus for not understanding practically in the same breath in which he concedes the Spirit’s work is not understandable. Jesus is not going to let Nicodemus—or us—get away with hiding behind astonished questions. He wants Nicodemus to get closer to the mystery of God’s grace; to dive into it; to revel in that which he cannot manage, that which he cannot track.</p>
<p class="indent">Nicodemus will never understand grace, but Jesus wants him to understand something of what God’s grace is <em class="calibre8">about</em>. And Nicodemus seems interested in this, too, going out of his way to pay Jesus a visit in the middle of the night. A pastor once told me, in a surprised voice, that the members of his congregation “keep coming back . . . week after week!” Nicodemus and my friend’s parishioners both want to know what grace is about, and so do we. But we all find ourselves nitpicking and dissecting rather than actually taking the plunge.</p>
<p class="indent">What is it that keeps us from jumping into the pool of God’s grace? What is it that makes us climb out even after we’ve been fully embraced? Little kids just learning to swim have real and understandable fear. Maybe fear is in play for Nicodemus as well—and maybe even for us. After all, the same water that supports us when we float can also, potentially, drown us. And—even if we <em class="calibre8">do</em> survive the jump—it is different living wet than living dry. On the outside of the pool, we can be warm, presentable, and self-possessed. We can even doll ourselves up a little and pay a visit to Jesus, sitting across from him and engaging in polite, logical, respectable conversation. There would be no need for <a id="page_236" class="calibre7"></a>sarcasm here, since a Jesus-kept-at-arms-length would never make us feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="indent">But being born from above—jumping from the known, dry edge into the mysterious deep—requires a conscious letting go of control. To get wet is to be affected. To be “born of the Spirit” is to be melted and molded, not simply tweaked or improved. Nicodemus is not looking to be melted and molded.<a id="rch8en12" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en12" class="calibre5">12</a></sup> His spiritual goal seems to be, admirably enough, to “be his best self now.”<a id="rch8en13" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en13" class="calibre5">13</a></sup> Clearly, Jesus’s insistence on the necessity of transformation disturbs Nicodemus. It rocks his boat, so to speak—and he doesn’t want to fall into the water.</p>
<p class="indent">Surprisingly, Jesus doesn’t do anything but exacerbate Nicodemus’s discomfort. I mean—as if Jesus’s testimony to the mysterious work of the Spirit isn’t disconcerting enough—Jesus then starts in on his own relationship to Nicodemus’s spiritual quest. It is hard to know what is more decentering: the unchartable blowing of the Spirit or the trackable manifestation of God’s love for the world in the historical figure Jesus of Nazareth. “We speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen,” Jesus tells Nicodemus, “and you have not received our testimony.” The Son of Man has descended from heaven and will be lifted up—as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness—that all who look upon him will have eternal life.<a id="rch8en14" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en14" class="calibre5">14</a></sup> The Kingdom of God is seen in the particular face of Jesus, the Son sent by the God who so loves the world. Nicodemus had to be taken aback even further by these words of Jesus. Can you imagine? You come to Jesus, acknowledging him as a teacher sent by God, and he not only tells you that you must be born again by some unpredictable Spirit, but that he himself is the one through whom the world will be saved.</p>
<p class="indent">It is no wonder Nicodemus has trouble getting into the pool. He is sitting there, listening to Jesus, looking over the edge, thinking about what it might be like to jump into the water. The chaotic character of the Spirit is off-putting, but one might be able to gather enough courage to leap anyway and hope for the best. But then there is all this talk about Jesus himself. The unpredictable, unknowable Spirit is joined by the particular, known event of Jesus Christ. And Nicodemus—as I imagine it—moves from not jumping in because he is afraid of the chaos, to not jumping in <a id="page_237" class="calibre7"></a>because he is suddenly offended. <em class="calibre8">You’re telling me</em>, he might well have said to Jesus, <em class="calibre8">you’re telling me that my way to seeing the Kingdom of God is you? You—specifically?</em></p>
<p class="indent">I mentioned, in <a href="chapter04.xhtml" class="calibre7">chapter 4</a>, that Kierkegaard uses the startling language of “offense” to describe our reaction to God. He might say it is our <em class="calibre8">offense</em> that most often keeps us from jumping into the water of grace.<a id="rch8en15" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en15" class="calibre5">15</a></sup> Contemplating the water, we <em class="calibre8">think</em> we are offended by what the incarnation says about God. To insinuate that the omnipotent, omnipresent, immutable God who created the universe can be known in a singular event, in a particular person, is scandalous. We think we know what God is like, and God is not a baby squirming in a manger, a man who eats with tax collectors and sinners, a criminal who dies a disgraceful death.</p>
<p class="indent">We think we’re offended by what the incarnation says about God, Kierkegaard suggests. But what offends us, in fact, is what it says about us. Because if it really is the case that God became flesh because God so loved the world, this means that we matter to God. We are loved by God. We are precious in God’s sight. And to be viewed as beloved by God is almost unbearable, given that we so often perceive ourselves as <em class="calibre8">un</em>lovable. My offense, like my sarcasm, creates distance between me and my rebirth, between me as I know myself to be and me as I really am in Christ.</p>
<p class="indent">It might seem a funny thing to be talking about jumping into a pool of grace, for those who believe they have been claimed by God regardless of their cognizance of this reality. But even Calvin, who emphasized predestination, was a strong advocate of people living with an awareness of their salvation. He thought that <em class="calibre8">perceiving</em> we belong to God “in life and in death” was God’s earnest desire for us. Contrary to popular stereotypes, Calvin thought the doctrine of election was deeply <em class="calibre8">reassuring</em>. Because being born again is the Spirit’s doing, and not our own, he thought, we can be confident that we are God’s own. Listen again to Calvin’s definition of faith, with this in mind: “Faith is the firm and certain knowledge of God’s benevolence toward us, founded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ, both revealed to our minds and sealed upon our hearts through the Holy Spirit.”<a id="rch8en16" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en16" class="calibre5">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_238" class="calibre7"></a>So, how is it, exactly, that we make the move from being afraid and offended to taking the plunge? As Christian believers, we should know better than to exhort one another simply to “have faith” and “jump.” We cannot be born again on the basis of our own efforts or we would have done so by now. Faith is not something we need a little bit of <em class="calibre8">in addition to</em> grace. Rather, faith itself is a <em class="calibre8">form</em> of grace. As Karl Barth put it, our belief in Jesus Christ is, actually, a kind of surplus grace—constitutive of the gift itself.<a id="rch8en17" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en17" class="calibre5">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">But we would be mistaken if we understood the journey from the edge of the pool into the water to be all about God and not at all about us. We would be forgetting to take into account the particular manifestation of God’s love as it has been made known to us, by way of the testimony of the Spirit, in Jesus Christ. Jesus saves us not by becoming a hero who rescues us, but by entering into existence with us and thereby including us in the life and work of God. Our jumping is all God’s work and just as completely our own because—in and through Jesus Christ—our work is included <em class="calibre8">in</em> God’s work.<a id="rch8en18" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en18" class="calibre5">18</a></sup> Our lives are “hidden with Christ in God”;<a id="rch8en19" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en19" class="calibre5">19</a></sup> “everything God has is ours.”<a id="rch8en20" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en20" class="calibre5">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">And so, Jesus exhorts us, too, to set aside our sarcasm, our distancing questions, our fear, and our offense. He urges us to jump into the water of grace. To remember—anew—that “God so loved the world.”<a id="rch8en21" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en21" class="calibre5">21</a></sup> To be born “from above.” To risk being born—again.</p>
<h3 class="h2">S<small class="calibre3">PLASH</small>! T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> C<small class="calibre3">OST OF</small> H<small class="calibre3">OLDING</small> F<small class="calibre3">AITH</small></h3>
<p class="indent">So we take the leap. But we are not yet wet. Imagine that we have gone over the edge and are about to break the water’s surface. By the grace of God we have jumped, and—whether we like it or not—there’s really no turning back.</p>
<p class="indent">Have you ever experienced a moment of regret just before you hit the surface of the water in a swimming pool? “Oh . . . no . . . here we go! It’s about to get <em class="calibre8">really cold</em>. . . . And wet. And—well . . . I didn’t even <em class="calibre8">have</em> to <a id="page_239" class="calibre7"></a>do this. I know grace is irresistible, but this doesn’t mean we have to go overboard—does it? It seems to me I could be standing back on that nice dry edge right now, safe and composed.”</p>
<p class="indent">To jump into the pool is to risk transformation; to break the surface of the water is to pay an actual price. It costs us something to be born of the Spirit. We were suspicious that we might be getting into something serious, by jumping into the pool. And our suspicions, as it turns out, were right on target. Grace is not cheap for God, and it is not cheap for us. “Love so amazing, so divine, demands our life, our soul, our all.”<a id="rch8en22" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en22" class="calibre5">22</a></sup> As we hit the water, for just that split second, we know this for sure. The splash represents a moment of urgency; we are about to break through into a new reality. We are about to go under. And so we prepare, as best we can in that fraction of a second, for the dangers we are about to experience. We squeeze our eyes shut; we seal our lips tight. We brace for impact; to be buried underwater; to be cut off from the air that sustains us.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s hard to imagine a more solid jump than Ruth’s pledge in relation to Naomi in the book of Ruth. “Where you go, I will go,” Ruth says. “Where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die—there will I be buried.”<a id="rch8en23" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en23" class="calibre5">23</a></sup> Now, I recognize that the text does not record Ruth’s thoughts and feelings. But I still have to wonder, as a real human being learning from the faith journey of another human being, if Ruth had any second thoughts, however fleeting. I wonder if she woke up the next morning, replaying her speech to Naomi with just a touch of regret. Could she possibly have thought to herself, <em class="calibre8">Rats! Well—now I’ve really gone and done it. There’s nowhere to go but into that water. Why did I have to be so . . . well . . . definitive?</em></p>
<p class="indent">Of course, that’s the way real commitments are, aren’t they? They don’t leave a lot of wiggle room. There’s no such thing as a three-quarters-of-the-way jump. And so, if we are as righteous as Ruth, we follow through <em class="calibre8">despite</em> our emergent doubts.</p>
<p class="indent">D. L. Moody once wrote that “the problem with a living sacrifice is that it keeps crawling off the altar.”<a id="rch8en24" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en24" class="calibre5">24</a></sup> I just love this quote because it is so descriptive of the reality of our spiritual journeys. Of course we have second thoughts even as we make contact with the water of grace, the site <a id="page_240" class="calibre7"></a>of our transformation, the substance of our commitment. We’d be crazy <em class="calibre8">not</em> to have second thoughts, given that all things are about to become new—including us. This is why Paul finds it necessary to <em class="calibre8">appeal</em> to the justified-by-faith-alone Christians at Rome. “I <em class="calibre8">appeal</em> to you . . . to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,”<a id="rch8en25" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en25" class="calibre5">25</a></sup> he says. Splashing into the water will always remain a counterintuitive moment, even for the most graceful among us. It is not easy for us to continue climbing back up onto that altar, because to climb back onto the altar entails a cost.</p>
<p class="indent">Ruth seemed well aware that grace, though free, was never cheap. The costs of her commitment were many: she risked never getting married again, which made her both economically and physically vulnerable. She risked living out her life as a stranger in a strange land, as a Moabite living in Judah. And, she risked the unpleasantness of living her life with a “Naomi turned Mara.” Who wants to share their days with a bitter mother-in-law who has every reason to be depressed? But Ruth—fully aware of the risks she is taking—goes ahead and makes her counter-cultural, counter-logical, and counter-ambitious move. She takes the plunge because she is willing to make sacrifices for the sake of her family.</p>
<p class="indent">It is usually harder than we think it’s going to be to defy the expectations of the world and to be melted and molded by the transforming work of the Spirit.<a id="rch8en26" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en26" class="calibre5">26</a></sup> Too often we imagine we are following God’s creative leading when, really, all we are doing is perpetuating the status quo, strengthening the empire. Our ambition leads us away from the edge of the pool, away from the risk, toward drier and more manageable terrain. We are actually standing over in the picnic area, over there—next to Orpah (Naomi’s other daughter-in-law, who chooses to turn back and go home to her people).<a id="rch8en27" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en27" class="calibre5">27</a></sup> We may <em class="calibre8">think</em> we respect Ruth’s commitments, but really, we are doing so only in a hypothetical sense. In actuality, Orpah is our model; Orpah is clearly better at minimizing loss and managing long-term investments.</p>
<p class="indent">It is those of us who are just now splashing down into the water to whom I believe Paul is speaking in Romans chapter 12. He is speaking to those who have been born of the Spirit,<a id="rch8en28" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en28" class="calibre5">28</a></sup> those who believe that God is for us in the person of Jesus Christ.<a id="rch8en29" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en29" class="calibre5">29</a></sup> And Paul is exhorting us not to pull <a id="page_241" class="calibre7"></a>back from the splash, even if our intuition tells us to. We are to hit that water head-on, offering ourselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God.<a id="rch8en30" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en30" class="calibre5">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">But what does this really mean for us? I think Paul is here speaking with us very candidly about the cost of our new life in Christ. He seems to be giving us the “bottom line”—a “peek” at what things will look like after we’ve paid off our educational expenses. Holy. Blameless. Hmmmm . . . what happened to “sinful”? “Well . . . let me explain that,” Paul might say, pulling a mechanical pencil out of his front shirt pocket and circling something on a scrap of paper. “‘Sinful identity’ is the major thing that has to go. You just can’t afford it anymore, now that you’ve been made righteous in Christ.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now, of course Paul knows we continue to be sinners even after we’ve splashed into the pool. What he wants us to give up is claiming our sinfulness as our primary <em class="calibre8">identity</em>. He wants us to think about sin more as an aberration than as a given. He wants us to take seriously the fact that transformation entails the <em class="calibre8">cost</em> of dying to sin and the <em class="calibre8">promise</em> of being made alive again in Jesus Christ. He wants us to present ourselves to God not as sinners, but as “holy and acceptable” living sacrifices.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s amazing how difficult it is to give up our identity as sinners. It is a huge cost for us to put aside our sins of pride and self-abasement and stand clothed with nothing but the righteousness of Christ, with nothing but <em class="calibre8">relationship to</em> Christ. A sinful identity provides more coverage, you see, than a “holy and acceptable” identity. There are, simply, a lot more accessories in the wardrobe of the sinner than the wardrobe of the saint. A lot more protection against getting too carried away with this transformation stuff. A lot more buffer between ourselves and the overpowering claim of God’s “good, pleasing, and perfect will.”<a id="rch8en31" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en31" class="calibre5">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Who are we, anyway, to even presume we can be holy and blameless? We might ask ourselves this, feeling very pious, even as we hit the water. Surely, one can be wet and still hold on to at least some sins. As we mentioned in the prior section, both the Spirit and Jesus seem interesting in drowning us, if necessary, for the sake of new life. Our sins, you see, could act as life preservers to keep us afloat. Can’t you just <em class="calibre8">see</em> Paul, with this <a id="page_242" class="calibre7"></a>image in mind: the Christians at Rome <em class="calibre8">finally</em> knowing what it’s about, grabbing frantically for a way to hold on to parts of their old selves, parts of this world. “Be not conformed to this world,”<a id="rch8en32" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en32" class="calibre5">32</a></sup> Paul tries to remind them.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the stories I tell that illustrates how we have trouble letting go of our sinful identity is about a former professor at Austin Seminary named James I. McCord. One of the things Dr. McCord was known for was the way he greeted students as he entered the classroom. “Good morning, saints,” he would say. “Good afternoon, saints.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now, I love this greeting, theologically speaking, especially when I reflect on it in tandem with Romans 12. But try it out the next time you lead off a meeting at your church. If your experience is anything like mine, you will find that people will resist answering, laughing and shaking their heads as though the very idea they could be saints is absurd. And it is not only the case that people <em class="calibre8">don’t</em> think of themselves as saints; they also don’t want to. Like I said, the suspicion is that sainthood does not come with enough accessories—what if all you get are one of those thin monk’s robes with a cincture?!</p>
<p class="indent">How is it that we who are just breaking into the water can put off the urge to grab a life preserver? How can we sacrifice our identity as sinners? The answer is simple, but hard: by trusting Jesus as Lord, and giving up our own lordship. As those who are guilty of the sin of pride, on the one hand, we are still thinking we can somehow manage our entry into the water even after we have taken the leap. We’re great with Paul’s exhortation to live; we’re resistant to being living <em class="calibre8">sacrifices</em>. As those guilty of the sin of self-deprecation, on the other hand, we have the opposite problem. We’re perfectly willing to be overtaken by the water, to sacrifice ourselves in our unworthiness. What we have trouble with is the idea we are called to be <em class="calibre8">living</em> sacrifices. To trust Jesus as Lord, when our sin is self-deprecation, is to recognize that Christ removed from us our very unworthiness. As Barth, again, so well put it, the judge was judged in our place so that we might engage in “other more important and more happy and more fruitful activities” than the judgment of ourselves or others.<a id="rch8en33" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en33" class="calibre5">33</a></sup> To know Jesus as Lord is to know the cost of laying down our sinful, prideful, self-abasing identities.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_243" class="calibre7"></a>There is another cost as well. An even higher one, especially for those of us who are wealthy, educated, and/or socially well-adjusted. It is the cost that comes with renouncing conformity to this world and being transformed by the renewing of our minds. And just as it is a little nerve-wracking to think about putting aside our sinful identities, so it offends our pious sensibilities to assume <em class="calibre8">we</em> can know the “good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.” Talk about presumption, we think, exclaiming (with an air of humility) that <em class="calibre8">we don’t really know</em> what <em class="calibre8">God desires</em> even when we actually have a pretty good idea. Such false humility is, again, a barrier to our transformation. And so Jesus keeps shaking us awake, begging us to pray with him for an hour, beseeching us to join with him in accomplishing the will of God in this world.</p>
<p class="indent">The WWJD?<a id="rch8en34" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en34" class="calibre5">34</a></sup> movement, for all its faults, seemed genuinely interested in the renewal of Christian life. “Walking the walk, and not just talking the talk” takes the splash, as well as the jump, pretty seriously. It takes into account the costliness of grace.</p>
<p class="indent">You might be aware that the WWJD slogan was taken from a book, first published in 1918, titled <em class="calibre8">In His Steps</em>.<a id="rch8en35" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en35" class="calibre5">35</a></sup> The author of the book was Charles Sheldon, a leader in the social gospel movement of the early twentieth century. In this novel, a town is transformed as a result of all the Christian members of the town asking themselves the question: “What would Jesus do?” and then following through. My only criticism of Sheldon’s book is that he makes doing what Jesus would do seem too easy. Sheldon suggests that once we figure out what Jesus would do, it is simply a matter of deciding to obey. But I have a story that illustrates just how difficult the follow through can be.</p>
<p class="indent">It was early in the spring semester of a class I used to teach titled “Theological Reflection in Contemporary Society.” On the way to class I stopped by my mailbox and found an oval, one-inch WWJD lapel pin that had been sent to me by a religious marketer. The special thing about this pin was that, when you pressed the button under the lettering, a little red light on it would blink on and off.</p>
<p class="indent">On a whim, I pinned this thing on my jacket, turned on the blinking light, walked into class, and began to lecture. A few minutes into my <a id="page_244" class="calibre7"></a>lecture, one of my students interrupted to ask why I was wearing that “very annoying” light pin. “What—this?” I asked, with exaggerated surprise. “Why—this is a WWJD pin. Do you have a problem with that?” I then launched into guiding a class discussion that I thought beautifully displayed my brilliant pedagogy. We talked about whether or not we would do what Jesus would do, if and when we knew what it was. Of the twenty-nine students who were there, every single one agreed that, when we <em class="calibre8">do</em> know what Jesus would do, we should certainly do it.</p>
<p class="indent">I then turned—spontaneously—to what was in that week the hottest Austin news story. You may remember it: Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted murderer and rehabilitated born-again Christian, was due to be executed shortly. There was unbelievable pressure on the governor to commute her sentence, since her rehabilitation seemed real and since she would become the first woman to be executed in the state of Texas.</p>
<p class="indent">We took a vote, and twenty-nine of the twenty-nine students agreed that Jesus would <em class="calibre8">not</em> execute Karla Faye Tucker.</p>
<p class="indent">But then something strange happened. Twenty-seven of the twenty-nine students in the class suddenly reneged on their commitment to do what Jesus would do. They declared that we <em class="calibre8">should</em> execute Karla Faye Tucker, arguing that it would be presumptuous to think that we could ever do what Jesus would do. One of these students actually proposed that, in all humility, we wear buttons with a different set of letters: “WWJWUTD”? (“What Would Jesus Want Us To Do?”). Clearly, the student argued, Jesus would want <em class="calibre8">us</em> to execute Tucker, even if he wouldn’t do it himself. Jesus is at liberty to forgive and extend mercy; we, with our sinful identities in place, can only do the next best thing.</p>
<p class="indent">I am telling you this story not to make a case against capital punishment,<a id="rch8en36" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en36" class="calibre5">36</a></sup> but because I believe it offers a blatant example of how difficult it is to stay with the transformation process, even for those of us who—by the grace of God—have managed to take the leap. When what we believe contradicts what we think, it is time to leave behind what we “think” as part of the cost. As part of the cost of discipleship. As consistent with the work of grace, which is not cheap, but costly.<a id="rch8en37" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en37" class="calibre5">37</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_245" class="calibre7"></a>“The problem with living sacrifices is that they keep crawling off the altar.” Our toes have barely broken the service of the water and already our necks are craned back around, looking toward Orpah. Looking—most commonly—not for debauchery, or gluttony, or titillation. But looking for the most reasonable, practical, marketable, acceptable, and respectable things this world has to offer. When we conform, we generally conform to the very best things of this world—don’t we? And it is our Achilles heel to think what we are conforming to is therefore OK, and to defy any of our brothers and sisters to tell us otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">To be perfectly honest: at this point I can hardly wait to get to the next section so I can talk about the happier stuff. Because the jumping in, and especially the splash that follows, is pretty rough. It’s the splash that signals burial; it’s the splash that is the grueling pain of labor, the cry of dereliction, the death of self. The death of <em class="calibre8">our</em> selves. As it turns out, when Paul was making his appeal to the believers at Rome, he was also pleading with us. I’m considering putting a little reminder of this in my own Bible—circling the first two verses of Romans 12 and drawing an arrow to the sentence: “This means you!”</p>
<p class="indent">How dare we assume we are Ruth when we are not. How dare we assume we are being somehow transformed when the water has hardly been disturbed, when no sacrifices have been made, when no cost is in evidence. To splash into the water of grace is to let go of such hypocrisy and be renewed with a right spirit. It is to move closer to having a faithfull answer to the essential question, <em class="calibre8">How are things with your heart?</em></p>
<h3 class="h2">S<small class="calibre3">URFACE</small>: T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> P<small class="calibre3">ROMISE OF</small> F<small class="calibre3">AITH</small></h3>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at what some see as a paradigmatic story of the love of God: the so-called parable of the prodigal son, as it is told by Luke.<a id="rch8en38" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en38" class="calibre5">38</a></sup> I’m guessing many of us can sympathize with the characters in this story, especially with the elder brother. (This might be because most people who <a id="page_246" class="calibre7"></a>would read a book like this <em class="calibre8">are</em> the other brother. Even if you were <em class="calibre8">once</em> a prodigal, you are likely an elder child now.)</p>
<p class="indent">Elder siblings that we are, we naturally feel guilty. We know, you don’t have to tell us—we <em class="calibre8">should</em> just go to the party, even if we don’t feel like it. We know we need to be more forgiving—like God—and we’re working on it. Let’s put aside our guilt, for a minute, and take a second look at this character with whom we likely identify. (If you are unfamiliar with this story, you might want to pause and read Luke 15:11-32.)</p>
<p class="indent">The elder son makes a pretty good argument, in this passage. He really speaks his mind. While the father clearly has some of the worst boundaries of anyone in the New Testament (in our day we would surely recommend therapy!), the elder son is clear about his expectations and what he wants. The younger brother had received his half of the property no questions asked, with poor consequences to follow. The elder brother feels entitled to at least a party, especially since he has run circles around his younger brother in terms of showing up and taking responsibility.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of us probably identify with this elder brother, thinking he makes a pretty good case. Some do argue his question betrays a misunderstanding of inheritance law.<a id="rch8en39" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en39" class="calibre5">39</a></sup> But this line of argument seems to miss the point. It’s not as though the father could have reminded his older son that the fatted calf was his to give away, and the elder son would have apologized for having been confused about the law, and the problem between them would have been cleared up. The elder son isn’t interested in making a technical point about inheritance. He’s telling his father how hurt he feels, and how unfairly he believes he’s been treated. “Look!” he says. “I’ve served you all these years, and I never disobeyed your instruction. Yet you’ve never given me as much as a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.” What the elder son can’t swallow is that his irresponsible, wasteful, inconsiderate brother is being thrown a party by his friends while <em class="calibre8">he</em> never has. And we, the readers, can’t make much sense of this either. I mean—it’s one thing to pay a person the same wages for working an hour that you pay someone who has worked for a day. But this situation, from the elder son’s perspective, is more like paying the person who worked for an hour a year’s salary, and giving the person who has worked <a id="page_247" class="calibre7"></a>for a year nothing at all. In other words, the elder son isn’t begrudging his little brother a party as much as he is saying that he wants one too. If the undeserving one gets a party, surely the deserving one should get one.</p>
<p class="indent">The father’s response is also difficult to understand. “Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours,” he says. I continue to struggle with what this means. I used to think that the father was more or less explaining where he was coming from, but without really addressing, directly, his son’s complaint. I even wondered if the son’s concerns were being minimized, as though knowing that the father’s possessions are his is an equivalent alternative to enjoying these possessions in a rip-roaring celebration with friends. Now I wonder if the father might actually be saying that of course his son can have a party. <em class="calibre8">Did you think you had to wait around for me to give you a goat? I thought you knew that everything that is mine is yours! We can start making plans at any time—just give me the word</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of what the father is saying or not saying about a party for the elder son, one thing is clear: these two are on different wavelengths. The son is thinking of his relationship to his father in terms of fair transactions, the father in terms of the sharing of life. The son is operating in accordance with the “order of justice,” the father in accordance with the “order of grace.”<a id="rch8en40" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en40" class="calibre5">40</a></sup> The son is sitting, with a calculator, at the table by the side of the pool. The father is in the pool, yearning for his sons to perceive they are in there with him.</p>
<p class="indent">The promise of grace, as we break through the surface of the water, is exactly the father’s promise to the elder son: everything God has is ours! In and through Jesus Christ, the one in whom we believed when we jumped, we participate in the very life and work of God. Having splashed into the water and died to our own sinful identities, we rise again to the surface, claiming the new life—and the new selves—God has promised.</p>
<p class="indent">The promise is not that we emerge sinless, but that sin no longer has the power to incapacitate us, to keep us from knowing the good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God. Martin Luther explains it this way: he says that <em class="calibre8">surfacing</em> Christian believers should “sin boldly, and love God more boldly still.”<a id="rch8en41" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en41" class="calibre5">41</a></sup> The promise of God is that sin has been dealt with, <a id="page_248" class="calibre7"></a>that to be sinners is to turn away from who we really are in Christ, and that one day sin will be no more. To sin boldly, for Luther, means not that we don’t sin, but that sin cannot and will not incapacitate us, if only we enter immediately into the God-given cycle of confession, repentance, and restoration.<a id="rch8en42" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en42" class="calibre5">42</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In our surfacing, we follow in the pattern of Christ in the great kenotic hymn of Philippians 2. With Christ we have died, and with him we have been raised. This, I believe, is a version of double predestination that makes a little more sense than Calvin’s version.<a id="rch8en43" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en43" class="calibre5">43</a></sup> He—Christ—is both the reprobate and the elect one. God made Jesus “to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”<a id="rch8en44" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en44" class="calibre5">44</a></sup> In and through him we acknowledge that we are at once both incapable of making any contribution and fully included as essential participants in the divine work.<a id="rch8en45" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en45" class="calibre5">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This is not the way the elder son is thinking about it. He’s more practical about his capabilities and contributions than all this. He’d be the ideal employee for writing up an annual self-assessment, wouldn’t he? He’d list out everything he had done for that year, and his expectations for how the administration should respond. You can almost imagine him going into his annual review meeting, a coffee cup in hand that reads: <em class="calibre8">Do your best, and God will take care of the rest</em>. Or, maybe, he’d modify it a little to: <em class="calibre8">I’m doing my best, and</em> my <em class="calibre8">best is pretty darn good</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">And that’s the problem, we might suspect, with the elder son. He’s a little too full of himself. He’s like that rich man—you know . . . the one who <em class="calibre8">says</em> he has kept all the commandments since the day he was born?<a id="rch8en46" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en46" class="calibre5">46</a></sup> (<em class="calibre8">Oh—come on!</em> I imagine you are thinking. <em class="calibre8">You can see that he hasn’t. After all</em>—<em class="calibre8">he just lied!</em>) We might suggest to the rich man that what he needs to do is tone it down a bit. To realize that living a life of obedience is about acknowledging we can do <em class="calibre8">some</em> things, but not <em class="calibre8">all</em> things. What we need to do, we might advise him, is recognize our unworthiness and humbly trust God might be able to use our meager contribution somewhere along the line.</p>
<p class="indent">But that’s not really quite right, is it? To emerge from the depths of the water, to live as children of the promise, is not only to believe God will <a id="page_249" class="calibre7"></a>accomplish significantly more than we might expect, and that somehow we will have some small role to play in whatever God is up to. It is, rather, to believe God will accomplish what is utterly impossible, and that we will have essential roles to play in the divine accomplishing. <em class="calibre8">Just remember</em>, we might imagine God saying to us elder children. <em class="calibre8">Remember that you are my child; we live and work together; everything I have is yours</em>. As it turns out, to be theocentric in our reading of salvation history is not to sideline ourselves in pious recognition that it is <em class="calibre8">God</em>, and not <em class="calibre8">us</em>, who accomplishes God’s purposes. To buy into an either/or, in this matter, is to be thinking in a transactional, rather than a participatory, manner. Thinking in this way is a humbler version of the elder son’s mistake. Refusing actually to be in the pool, it negotiates between what it is that <em class="calibre8">God</em> does, and what it is that <em class="calibre8">we</em> do. The strictest Calvinists among us might say that God does it <em class="calibre8">all</em>, and we do <em class="calibre8">nothing</em>. Most of us, worried that this might foster passivity in relationship to Christian life and work, want to be able to say we do “just a little something.” God is 99 and 44/100th percent sovereign, we seem sometimes to be thinking, but there needs to be just a little power for us—56/100 of a percent, or so. “I can’t do much,” we say to ourselves, “but I hope to do a <em class="calibre8">little something</em>.”</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast to this, the promise and miracle of grace is that we who can do <em class="calibre8">nothing</em> in and of ourselves can do <em class="calibre8">all things</em> in Jesus Christ who strengthens us.<a id="rch8en47" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en47" class="calibre5">47</a></sup> This is the promise we are charged to lay claim to, even in the midst of all of our wretchedness.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ve suggested that Abraham and Ruth understand this—the two of them seem to be in the pool, reveling in their inheritance even before their wealth is in evidence. But another person who is really keyed in is Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary shows us what it looks like to live in the pool. “How can this be?” she asks, contemplating the water. “Let it be unto me as you have said!”<a id="rch8en48" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en48" class="calibre5">48</a></sup> she says, jumping in. And—splash!—she lets go of defining herself in relation to her limitations as a virgin and is newly created as the servant of God through whom—and with whom—and, certainly, <em class="calibre8">in</em> whom—the impossible is made possible. Mary can do nothing in and of herself. She is a virgin. Totally depraved. Aware that, by virtue of her own good efforts, she can contribute not one iota to the coming of God’s <a id="page_250" class="calibre7"></a>Kingdom to earth as it is in heaven. And simultaneously she also recognizes she is an essential, creative contributor to the divine work. She is, in fact, the Mother of God—the one who bears God to the world. She jumps into that water as one who submits to her role in the divine plan, and she is exalted. When Mary surfaces, she does not do so as a passive vessel who may have a little something to contribute, but as a true heir of everything God has and partner in the divine work.</p>
<p class="indent">Mary sees herself as God sees her. She rises up out of that water not only as a virgin who has contemplated the risk, not only as a servant who, diving in, has paid a price, but now as the Blessed One who participates in God’s saving work in the world. “With all my heart I glorify the Lord!” Mary sings. God has “filled the hungry with good things” and “sent the rich away empty-handed.”<a id="rch8en49" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en49" class="calibre5">49</a></sup> We see, in the example of Mary, that the promise of God is not that we will be used, as passive vessels, if we only submit. The promise is that we, in our submission to the God who is able to do “far more than all we can ask or imagine”<a id="rch8en50" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en50" class="calibre5">50</a></sup> will ourselves become creators of life. We will be poets, we will be prophets, we will bear God to the world.</p>
<p class="indent">It would have already been a benevolent thing if God had offered us just a small portion of the Kingdom. Just a small mansion on the corner. Just enough daily bread. It would be more than we deserve, and it would be manageable and understandable. If God had done that much, Christian life could then have been about “offering back to God a small portion of what God has given us,” and we could have spent our time deliberating about what that might look like, about how we might achieve the proper balance.</p>
<p class="indent">But then God had to go and give us the whole farm. And now God wants our help in running it. And not so much because God sees value in doling out chores. God believes we, like Mary, have something essential to offer to the work of salvation. Even more significantly, God desires that we participate in the divine life and work for the same reason God entered the world in Jesus Christ and fills the world with the Spirit: God wants to be actively with us, and wants us to be actively with God.</p>

Who—me? When did <em class="calibre8">I</em> feed you? When did <em class="calibre8">I</em> clothe you? When did <em class="calibre8">I</em> visit you when you were sick and in prison?” If I were one of those sheep, I wouldn’t have just idled before the king, trying to “recollect.” I would have <em class="calibre8">run</em> through those pearly gates before I was found out!</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of worrying that I am a goat, as I used to do, I instead devote my energies to imagining I’m a sheep. <em class="calibre8">Of course you want to be a sheep</em>, you’re probably thinking. <em class="calibre8">Who doesn’t? They get to go to heaven</em>. Well . . . I’m as interested in going to heaven as the next person, I suppose. But the reason I want to stand with the sheep is not as much because they beat out the goats as because they just seem so God-honest <em class="calibre8">free</em>. They don’t seem to be burdened by carrying around a list of what they believe, and what they have done (and for whom), and what their position is on x, y, and z issues (however important x, y, and z issues are). They seem to be living out their faith in a considerably less tense and clenchy sort of way.</p>
<p class="indent">Have you ever suddenly realized you were living as though life were a never-ending series of obligations? <em class="calibre8">I’ve got to get up and take a shower, I’ve got to get the kids to school.

Have you ever found yourself processing your relationships like a caller on the circa-1990s Dr. Laura radio show? <em class="calibre8">Dr. Laura, I’m calling to find out what my obligation is in relation to “person x.” Am I obligated to such-and-such?</em> Or, <em class="calibre8">My daughter will be eighteen next week. How will that change my obligation to her in relation to “y”?</em> The thing is, if everyone met their obligations, if everyone were half as responsible as the elder son, if everyone were attentive, for example, to the demands of distributive justice, the world would be a much better place. Transactions, when they are fair ones, can be almost transformative.</p>

Let’s face it: the better part of all of us does not want to help others merely because we feel a deep sense of <em class="calibre8">obligation</em> to do so. We got into this life—this calling—not because we felt obligated but because we experienced grace. Remember? We are here because we loved Jesus, and wanted, therefore, to feed his lambs and tend his sheep.<a id="rch8en52" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en52" class="calibre5">52</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">On the other side of the spectrum: Have you ever had someone thank you for something that you didn’t even realize you had done? So often we who are apt to reach out to others have to go begging for a word of appreciation. We hardly know what to do when it comes unaware, and certainly when we don’t think we’ve done anything we need to be thanked for. In French, by the way, the equivalent of the English “you’re welcome” is <em class="calibre8">de rien</em>. Literally, <em class="calibre8">de rien</em> means “it was nothing.” But—let’s face it—usually, even if we tell someone it was nothing, we really think it was a little something. I’m talking about those times when <em class="calibre8">de rien</em> means <em class="calibre8">de rien</em>. When—in the language of sheep—we really are bewilderedly bleating: “Huh?”</p>
<p class="indent">I think I know what is going on when thank-yous confuse us. We are swimming. We have surfaced in the pool and claimed God’s promise that everything God has is ours. We are holding firmly to faith. And we are reveling in the treasures that are our inheritance. To shift to a metaphor I have used elsewhere in this book: We are sitting in the center of the treasure trove, running gold coins through our fingers and hanging pearl necklaces around our necks. Everything God has is ours. The beauty of the earth. The power to admonish, and to forgive, and to heal. As Calvin put it, we are free to use God’s gifts for God’s purposes.<a id="rch8en53" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en53" class="calibre5">53</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">So why don’t we exercise this freedom more regularly? Maybe one reason we fall into the trap of begrudgingly meeting obligations is because we are spending out of our own personal bank account, rather than from the superabundant resources God shares with us. I probably don’t have to tell you that burnout, when it comes to matters of faith, is a big problem. I’m thinking one reason it is such a big problem has to do exactly with what we’ve been talking about—that is, we have been operating transactionally, rather than gracefully. If we imagine ourselves doling out portions of what God has so generously given us, if we imagine that what we need, <a id="page_253" class="calibre7"></a>to prevent burnout, is to make enough time to spend with God ourselves so we can then receive from God enough to continue doling out to others, well . . . if this is the way we are operating, it is a losing battle. Not to mention a human-centered one, instead of God-centered. Christian life becomes all about what <em class="calibre8">I</em> am able to gather and deliver. As if I’m a kind of “carrier pigeon,” rather than a partner with Christ in the ministry of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s no wonder that, in this position, I am counting up thank-yous, protecting my energy, adding and subtracting what I have left. I’m sitting there, at poolside, next to the elder son, doing calculations. Those stupid sheep, meanwhile, are splashing around in the pool, having a great time. (And I’m saying this with an awareness that sheep can’t even swim, having learned it from one of my country-born friends.)</p>
<p class="indent">Barth says we are “always mistaken” when we think there is “no other way” for us to be than stressed out, no other approach we can take than to “work tensely.” We could apply every one of the fabulous suggestions we come up with for living the Christian life and still miss out on grace. The trick to staying in the pool isn’t coming up with the right method, or even with the right metaphor. It is not to put aside the word <em class="calibre8">response</em> and come up with some other word, although doing so might well be more theologically accurate. What staying in the pool is about, rather, is living into our only true identity; seeing ourselves as God sees us; knowing ourselves as beloved children before our sovereign God. We live and work, as Christian disciples who know they are beloved, before the God who holds the waters of the cosmos in the hollow of God’s hand <em class="calibre8">and</em> calls each and every one of us by name. And when we engage our work <em class="calibre8">in the pool</em>, with an awareness of this God, according to Barth, we can “work ‘with the relief and relaxation which spring from’ our recognition of God.”<a id="rch8en54" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en54" class="calibre5">54</a></sup> This is “serious play, but play nonetheless.” Our resources will not dry up, for we are tapped into the life of the one who is infinite, the one who is Life Itself. We meet those we serve, then, with joy—not with strain—inviting them to revel with us in the inheritance that belongs to us all. We act not out of <em class="calibre8">obligation</em> to the other, but because we <em class="calibre8">are</em> for and with them, even as God, in Christ, is for and with us.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_254" class="calibre7"></a>Along the same lines, one of the things Paul says he desires—and prays—for the church at Philippi is that their “love may abound more and more, in knowledge and depth of insight.”<a id="rch8en55" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en55" class="calibre5">55</a></sup> Not that they would just manage to survive, not that they would just “hang in there,” somehow, until Jesus comes back. Not that they would just faithfully continue to meet their obligations to each other. Not that they would simply “do their best.” What Paul desires is that the love of Christ’s disciples <em class="calibre8">abound</em> and <em class="calibre8">overflow</em>, that the grace of God in which we swim pour through and from we who know and want to share—ever more deeply—what matters most.</p>
<p class="indent">Gutiérrez has developed the idea that the poverty of the Western world is a spiritual poverty, not the economic poverty Paul is usually talking about.<a id="rch8en56" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch8en56" class="calibre5">56</a></sup> We work very hard, we are overextended and stressed, and we have an inflated sense of self-importance, all because we’ve lost sight of who we are and what life’s about. We struggle with our self-created paucity of time, our self-created need to gain ever more wealth, and our interest in moving to ever more powerful jobs from which we feel pressure to rush into early retirement, where we do not know what to do with ourselves. We don’t know how to swim in the pool, Gutiérrez would say. And then he would add: but those who are truly poor—the economically poor—often do.</p>
<p class="indent">Someone asked me a question, recently, about Christians who preach about how God takes the side of the poor and marginalized then drive off in their fancy cars to their clearly privileged lives. This person made the good point that we who have wealth need to recognize our complicity in the power structures that be, if there is to be any hope for change. And part of our confession, as those with more, is that we don’t want change if it means giving up our nice cars, or houses, or securities.</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe part of the problem is that we’re thinking in zero-sum quantities again—in transactional ways that get us stuck, rather than in gracefull ways that open us to the resources of God. The thing is: those with material wealth are called to give to the poor not because they <em class="calibre8">should</em>, not in order to meet an <em class="calibre8">obligation</em>, but because they are <em class="calibre8">with</em> and <em class="calibre8">for</em> the poor who also have something to share with them. God’s ways drive me crazy, sometimes, and one of those times is in relation to how I approach serving the sheep. It’s hard enough for me to make some kind of effort to feed <a id="page_255" class="calibre7"></a>the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the sick and those in prison—or even load the dishwasher or grade a paper, for goodness’ sake—as a responsible person meeting my obligations. But God wants me to do these things so freely that I don’t even know I’m doing them. God desires that my service to others springs from who I am. Overflows from who I am, in fact, as a child of God swimming in the water of grace.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve heard Gutiérrez jokingly say that, if we can get ourselves to write a check only by way of guilt and obligation, he’ll still take the check. He’ll take it because the economically poor can use it to eat. He’ll take it because it will help alleviate poverty and hunger. But it will not relieve spiritual poverty, no matter how many checks are written, no matter how obediently obligations are met, if those writing the checks are still sitting at that table, six feet from the edge of the pool.</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe what the sheep teach us is that, from the vantage point of grace, our focus should be much less on <em class="calibre8">doing things for each other</em> and much more on <em class="calibre8">being with and for each other</em>. After all, what is most extraordinary about God is not that God has done great things. God is omnipotent, to do “great things,” for one who is omnipotent, is par for the course. What is extraordinary—what is, in fact, the greatest miracle of all—is that this one who does great things empties Godself to be with us, and keeps insisting on being for us, drawing us into the divine work.</p>
<p class="indent">Do we want to be with one another? Are we, really, <em class="calibre8">for</em> one another? For our families? For those to whom we minister? For the poor? Is our frenetic focusing on meeting our obligations getting in the way of our knowing what all this is about?</p>
<p class="indent">To swim is to recognize there are others in the water. To share with them, to splash with them, to play with them, to <em class="calibre8">love</em> them. To live the Christian life means continuing to increase in a love for others that overflows so freely that our service becomes an extension of who we are, an expression of our freedom in Christ.</p>
<p class="indent">When this happens, we are ready to answer the question, “How are things with your heart?” with conviction and joy. “I am blessed,” we will say, in whatever words we use. “I am blessed, indeed.”</p>
