<p class="noindent">Christianity teaches that the God who meets us and makes us also blesses us. The blessings of God are often associated with the nurturing, sustaining, and sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, who fosters our joyful awareness of our salvation so that our lives might be transformed accordingly. The Holy Spirit might move in anyone, anywhere, at any time, but is never anyone’s personal possession. The Bible and the creeds of the church testify that the Spirit who—like the wind—“blows wherever it wishes”<a id="rch7en1" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en1" class="calibre5">1</a></sup> is also reliable and consistent, showing up when the people of God gather and watching over them even when they are too disillusioned, or frightened, or skeptical to hold faith. Where the Spirit is present in the context of a community of believers, there we find the church.</p>
<p class="indent">Of all the analogies I think of when I think of the church, the one that stands out is a bit dangerous: I think of church as “home.” The reason the analogy is dangerous is, as so many in our culture are pointing out today, <a id="page_206" class="calibre7"></a>because the church more often than not falls short of being the safe and nurturing place it promises to be and that people hope it will be. Given this, a good argument might be made for setting the metaphor of “home” to the side and lowering expectations for what church has to offer. Then, perhaps, people of faith would be less likely to be labeled hypocrites when church communities don’t deliver.</p>
<p class="indent">I vote for a different approach: calling the church “home”—even when the term doesn’t quite fit, descriptively—as a way of naming, and holding to account, what the church is called to be. Just as we do not always live and act as who we are in Christ, so the church too falls short of who it is and will be, as the bride lifted up, holy and without blemish,<a id="rch7en2" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en2" class="calibre5">2</a></sup> by the bridegroom, Christ.<a id="rch7en3" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en3" class="calibre5">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">My pastor friend, Laura, models holding the church to the highest ideal and working to make it so. At the beginning of every church service at which she preaches and presides she leads a procession of youth down the center aisle. Each carries something essential not only to what will happen in the service to follow, but to the identity and for the comfort of every person in the room. There is a huge pitcher of water almost too heavy to carry, a freshly baked loaf of bread, a beautiful flask full of wine, a been-there-since-the-church-was-founded Bible with a musty, leathery smell and fancy type, and candles that are hard to light and drip all over the place, but that everyone always likes. She places the Bible in the pulpit and lights the candles, heaving the pitcher up and pouring the water splashily into the font; she arranges the elements on the beautifully laid-out Communion Table. Then she takes a big loaf of bread, breaks it in half, extends her arms to the people of God with half a loaf in each hand, and says—with a huge smile on her face—“Welcome home!”</p>

<p class="indent">“Home is where your heart is,” the saying goes. Most of us agree with this statement, I bet. Even when we work hard to make our houses or <a id="page_207" class="calibre7"></a>apartments comfortable, safe, accessible, warm and hospitable, we know our home isn’t, finally, the actual building we live in. What makes for a home is the community we call our own. A place, as the old <em class="calibre8">Cheers</em> sitcom celebrates, “where everybody knows your name.”<a id="rch7en4" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en4" class="calibre5">4</a></sup> A place where people who know you “warts and all” not only love you, but believe you have a God-given purpose in this world and insist on helping you discover and embrace it. A home is a place where you are met by those who love you and made more into who you are, in and through relationship with them.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children seem to understand what a home is better than adults. I had a friend who discovered this in the context of doing a children’s sermon, as part of the regular Sunday morning worship service, on the subject of “church.” He told me his plan the night before: he would start off with an old favorite: “Fold your hands like this,” he would say, interlocking his fingers and turning his palms downward, with knuckles facing up. “Now, put the tips of your index fingers together to make a point. There you go. ‘Here is the church; here is the steeple.’ Good. Now, keep your fingers locked together but turn them palm-side up. Pull your thumbs apart. Now wiggle your fingers back and forth. That’s it! ‘Here’s the church, here’s the steeple. Open the door and see all the people!’”<a id="rch7en5" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en5" class="calibre5">5</a></sup> His plan was to then ask the children what he thought was a fail-proof transition question to his fresh, new take: “Kids,” he would say, “what is the church?” And then he would sit back, waiting for them to give the answer he was sure they would give. “The church is this building we are sitting in,” they would say, he thought. “The church is the place we come to for Sunday school and worship.” My friend’s plan was, then, to lean in, in good pastorly fashion, and gently explain to the kids that, though this answer was good, the church is even more than the place we go for Sunday school and worship. It is, he would tell them—and at this point he would add extra emphasis—<em class="calibre8">the people of God</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">“What is the church?” my friend asked, on the prescribed Sunday morning. And immediately a very little girl chimed out her answer. “The church is the community of believers!” she proclaimed. “That’s right,” my friend responded, clearly surprised and at a loss for what to say next. “But did you know some people think it is the <em class="calibre8">building</em>?” he finally said.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_208" class="calibre7"></a>Often it is adults, even more than children, who strongly associate church with bricks and mortar, walls and ceilings—even to the point of identifying the buildings, instead of the people, as “home.” When neighborhoods change or congregations shift, suggesting that a move to a new location or smaller building would be in order, some of us would risk our church slowly dying off rather than relocating. Maybe this is because we feel sure, rightly or wrongly, that a move to a new building would mean the certain and sudden death of what we hold dear. We want to perpetuate for as long as possible all the life that has happened in that building, all the resources we have invested. We also associate buildings with our desire to increase church membership, organizing capital campaigns that emphasize additions or improvements to the brick-and-mortar that bank on a kind of “if we build it, they will come”<a id="rch7en6" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en6" class="calibre5">6</a></sup> philosophy. Budgets and stewardship campaigns are pitched in relation to what we dream of building or what we have already built that must be paid off. It can be helpful to the growth of a church and the sustaining of the people of God, of course, to add an education wing or to make the sanctuary more hospitable. It is perhaps too often the case, however, that improvements in programming and staffing or efforts to reach out to those in need are sacrificed for the sake of buying bricks and mortar.</p>
<p class="indent">New church initiatives often name the problem with over-associating church with buildings. Internet churches<a id="rch7en7" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en7" class="calibre5">7</a></sup> and other new church communities,<a id="rch7en8" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en8" class="calibre5">8</a></sup> for example, actively remember that the first communities of believers generally gathered in homes, pooling their talents, food, and other resources as they celebrated and shared the good news of Jesus Christ. They don’t want to be bogged down by raising money for building projects or by paying off building debt, which they view as taking away from more important aspects of their ministry, such as caring for their membership and ministering to people outside the walls of their meeting space.</p>
<p class="indent">To share one anecdote, along these lines: Several years ago, I learned a great deal from a brief visit with the pastoral staff of an internet-based church. While I suppose we could have had our meeting online, in a chat room or as avatars interacting with one another, we actually met face-to-face in a plain, square, inexpensive-to-maintain building they <a id="page_209" class="calibre7"></a>affectionately referred to as the “God-box.” The staff explained to me that their church had members from all over the world, and that they were joined together as one local community by way of their shared participation in a common worship service, posted weekly online (along with Bible studies, inspirational videos, and other resources).</p>
<p class="indent">“Why this building, then?” I asked them.</p>
<p class="indent">“We’ve found,” they said, “that some people want to worship with others instead of home, by themselves, on their computers. So, the church helps interested groups of people buy cheap buildings that people can go to worship together. They sit together in the ‘Assembly Room’ and we project the service on a big screen.”</p>
<p class="indent">We visited the Assembly Room. It seated about six hundred. “How many people do you get every week?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“About 2,100,” they said.</p>
<p class="indent">“Wow, that’s a lot!” I replied. And then I added, reflexively, “You must be looking for a bigger building.”</p>
<p class="indent">They got me on that one.</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh—no ma’am,” they said. “We aren’t interested in bigger buildings. We’re interested in people. What we do is offer multiple worship experiences so we can accommodate everyone. Everyone is participating in the exact same service, regardless of whether they come here or if they are worshipping at home. This is because they are all hearing the same sermon, music, and prayers—except at different times.”</p>
<p class="indent">I confess that I did challenge their idea that worship is the same regardless of whether you worship with others or not, for reasons I will expand on as this chapter unfolds. But mainly I left the meeting feeling less like I had offered them something from my store of theological wisdom and more like they had extended to me a productive challenge. Quit putting so much emphasis on buildings and put it on people instead, they were telling me. And in telling me this, they were building on a truth that we shared, a truth that all Christians claim to believe—the truth that was stated by the little girl at the children’s sermon. The truth is this: that the church is the “community of believers,” disciples gathered in one way or another; in one place or another; rather than in a certain kind of building with a steeple.</p>

<p class="indent">Many Christians today might be quick to suggest we need to be careful not to reduce church to “buildings”; we also should avoid defining “believers” too narrowly. Traditionally, a “believer” is someone who confesses faith in Jesus Christ as “Lord.” Such a person would be identified by Calvin as part of the <em class="calibre8">visible church</em>, and by Gutiérrez as a member of the <em class="calibre8">ekklesia</em>. But both Calvin and Gutiérrez insist there are those who are not currently confessing “Jesus as Lord” who should still be considered part of the Christian community. Calvin talks about the <em class="calibre8">invisible church</em>, along these lines, arguing that the invisible church includes those who are chosen by God but have not yet come to recognize this. He thinks Christians should treat everyone as though they are elect, since you never know in whom God has planted a “seed” of faith.<a id="rch7en9" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en9" class="calibre5">9</a></sup> Gutiérrez argues, similarly, that the church is present wherever the Holy Spirit is at work. When a person gives a cold cup of water to someone who is thirsty, the Spirit is present even if that person has not made a confession of faith. Gutiérrez calls the church in this broader sense the <em class="calibre8">koinonia</em> (meaning “fellowship”), in contrast to the <em class="calibre8">ekklesia</em>.<a id="rch7en10" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en10" class="calibre5">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">While Calvin understands the invisible church to be the context in which confessing Christians do the work of evangelism, Gutiérrez holds that the <em class="calibre8">koinonia</em> often offers a corrective to the <em class="calibre8">ekklesia</em>, acting as the “true church” in relation to the church that is a corrupted institution. In short, while Calvin thinks the church evangelizes the world that is the home of the invisible church, Gutiérrez thinks the world (as <em class="calibre8">koinonia</em>) often evangelizes the church.<a id="rch7en11" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en11" class="calibre5">11</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent">How we conceptualize what constitutes a church community has always been shaped by the way we understand the relationship of the <a id="page_211" class="calibre7"></a>worshipping community to the movement of the Holy Spirit in the world at large. These days, notions of what constitutes church continue to be broadened by changing understandings of “community” in our globalized, connected, twenty-first-century world. In recent times, social media has made possible the formation, maintenance, and nurture of communities never before possible, comprising people located in multiple places and time zones. Fifty years ago in the United States, when friends and relatives moved across the country from one another, the avenues for keeping up their relationships were limited to investing in expensive long-distance calls, writing letters that took several days to deliver, and making sporadic visits. This was, of course, in many ways an improvement on the possibilities of 150 years ago, when there were no cars, planes, or telephones and it took eighty-three hours to travel by train from New York City to San Francisco.<a id="rch7en12" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en12" class="calibre5">12</a></sup> Today, in a world in which more people have cell phones than toilets,<a id="rch7en13" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en13" class="calibre5">13</a></sup> it is possible for the first time in history to talk and text for hours on end every day, send pictures, or even put out-of-state (or country) grandparents on Facetime so they can be present at their granddaughter’s fifth-grade awards ceremony.</p>
<p class="indent">As we are all aware, however, a live and hotly debated question in contemporary American culture is whether we actually <em class="calibre8">do</em> use our technology to maintain and deepen relationships. Anecdotally, we often hear people grumble that they don’t have any desire to go on Facebook to find out what everyone ate for lunch. The suggestion, of course, is that social media interactions promote superficiality rather than relational depth. While those who value the ways social media have helped them keep up with friends far and wide will understandably push back against this stereotype, surely they will agree that texting does becomes a problem when it interferes with having meaningful, face-to-face conversations with those in physical proximity. It is safe to say that few people actually think it is a great idea to text one’s date from across the table in a restaurant, instead of actually talking.</p>
<p class="indent">If we stereotype social media users as not caring about community and never having relationships with any depth without opening ourselves to genuine consideration of their views, we may well miss out on learning <a id="page_212" class="calibre7"></a>how understandings of “community” are shifting and expanding. I can’t help but wonder if our disparaging stereotyping stems from fears about these shifts and feeling threatened by how committed to keeping up with others many Facebook users actually are. The fact is, social media users care <em class="calibre8">so much</em> about their communities that they carry them around with them—in their pockets and purses; on their iPhones, tablets, and laptops. And they nurture them constantly, feeding them “likes” and life updates and photos.<a id="rch7en14" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en14" class="calibre5">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Again, there are both up and down sides to this. Twenty years ago, as a professor, I could assume that students coming into my classroom were committed to investing in the community of the class, at least for the hour and twenty minutes, twice a week, that they were there. Now I can make no such assumption. Students come into class with Facebook running, and it becomes my job (whether I want it or feel it should be or not) to make a case for why they should privilege the possibility of a classroom community (which will exist, as such, for twelve weeks at three hours per week) over the established community of Facebook friends (which they have been building for years). It is by no means obvious to everyone who is walking through the classroom door, smiling down at whatever screen they are monitoring, that Facebook is a more superficial context for developing relationships. Questions I ask myself, especially right at the start of a new theology class, are: How do I make a theological case for why students should invest in this particular community? Why should they attend to the people in the room—listening to what others have to say and vulnerably sharing their own stories? Why should they risk setting their expectations high, hoping that something can happen in those thirty-six hours that is not only about meeting course requirements and getting a good grade, but also developing the kind of deep relational connections that lead to formation and transformation?</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps you would point out that there is more reason to invest in the church than the classroom, given that there are not the same kinds of time constraints at church. Also, while a classroom can function quite efficiently even with students who have not signed up for transformation, this might not be quite as true of church, where the expectation of <a id="page_213" class="calibre7"></a>transformation, while not a requirement, is hopefully not considered alien or intrusive. And yet church leaders, too, work hard to make a case for investment in community, particularly in the United States, these days, when membership is on the decline. What kinds of promises can we honestly make about church that might lead folks to invest? Here are some pitches I’ve seen on church billboards along the way (I bet you can add to the list): “We Are a Friendly Church!”; “Imperfect People Welcome!”; “Doubters Welcome!”; “Church isn’t church without ‘u’!”; “Free Coffee* and Fellowship (*we serve Starbucks)!”; “There Are Some Questions That Can’t Be Answered by Google”; “Don’t Ignore God’s Friend Request”; and “Blah blah blah. Just come to church.” In these days of declining memberships, religious leaders are scrambling to convince folks that church communities are worth investing in. There are conflicting sentiments about what is needed, in marketing the church, and where we have crossed the line from extending invitations and treating the church more as a commodity to be sold than a community in which to participate.<a id="rch7en15" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en15" class="calibre5">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">One arena in which different understandings of how to go about inviting others into the community of the church are showcased is in debates about whether entering into membership is still a valuable rite of passage into the community. There are always those who cannot understand why so many are resistant to joining, telling stories about how many years they have been members and how meaningful membership has been to them. But there are others who think it is not at all obvious they should become members of a church, even if they are involved in one. Some seem open to being convinced, but when they ask <em class="calibre8">why</em> they should become members, they are not given convincing answers. Often, they are told membership is a mark of commitment. But when they look at who seems most involved, there is not always a correlation between membership and involvement, or even membership and giving. Sometimes the most active members of church communities are, in fact, non-members. My pastor friends often share with me the ways in which this can interfere with the functioning of churches. For example, how do you know who to send the pledge cards to, they ask, if you don’t have an accurate roster of those who have publicly committed to extending their support (i.e., when they officially <a id="page_214" class="calibre7"></a>and before the congregation became members)? One pastor friend told me he couldn’t have the committee of elders he wants to have because his denomination allows only members to serve in this capacity. His most invested and gifted participants in the community, in other words, are not allowed to take on the very leadership roles for which they are most suited. He got around the problem by forming a “Vision Team” of non-members that meets regularly to brainstorm ideas with him. The pastor meets once a month with the elders, and once a month with the vision team.</p>
<p class="indent">There is certainly a place for grieving the losses to community associated with our social-media focused culture. It is also important to name its limits—a Skyped meeting is not as effective as a face-to-face meeting, and when everyone is only half invested in the important deliberations going on in a conference call because they are surreptitiously typing emails or cleaning Cheerios out from under the couch cushions, it might possibly have been better to have no meeting at all.<a id="rch7en16" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en16" class="calibre5">16</a></sup> That said, we can’t ignore how helpful technology is for those who are not trying to shortcut their participation, but are rather working to keep their place in the community. Reflecting on church, in this regard, isn’t it wonderful that people who are unable to get their bodies to Sunday morning worship due to illness or work commitments may tune into a service online rather than missing out altogether?</p>
<h3 class="h2">T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> C<small class="calibre3">HURCH AND</small> B<small class="calibre3">ODIES</small></h3>
<p class="indent">“Can my avatar take communion?”<a id="rch7en17" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en17" class="calibre5">17</a></sup> is a newer question related to who is invited to the Table. Can you have Christian community without bread? Without wine or juice? Without bodies?</p>
<p class="indent">Historically speaking, the church has not imagined such a thing until recently. It has always been in the business of gathering together actual bodies. We bring our bodies to church to sing, pray, listen, see, eat. The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper use the basic stuff needed for bodily existence: water, bread, wine. In churches people join their <a id="page_215" class="calibre7"></a>bodies together in marriage; into churches we carry the bodies of our beloved ones, hoping for resurrection. Social media has not yet usurped the church’s work of building communities made up of bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">That said, we do need to acknowledge that some people now go to church online. It is possible, for example, to create an avatar of oneself and to enter into the life of a virtual church community. One fifty(ish)-year-old pastor friend of mine recently shared that he himself is a member of a virtual church. He shares that the conversations he has, as an avatar with other avatars, are more authentic than most conversations he has—in physical church—with people whose real live bodies can be seen, touched, smelled, and embraced. My friend testifies that the church community he has joined online is in many ways more of a community than the physical church he still feels obligated to attend.</p>
<p class="indent">I’m not sure what to say about this. On the one hand, I’m glad my friend is finding community online, since I can tell this is meaningful to him. On the other hand, though, there is something about bodies that cannot be indefinitely left out. Something about living and breathing bodies, breaking bread together and stepping on each other’s toes. What is it about actual bodies that is—or at least should be—so important to community? Maybe it’s that we <em class="calibre8">are</em> bodies, and can therefore be fully known to one another only <em class="calibre8">as</em> bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lord’s Table is a locus, in church, where bodies are front and center. The body and blood of the ascended<a id="rch7en18" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en18" class="calibre5">18</a></sup> Jesus Christ are at the center of everything that happens, reminding us that Jesus Christ is “bone of our bones and flesh of our flesh.”<a id="rch7en19" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en19" class="calibre5">19</a></sup> And as if this isn’t strange enough, we <em class="calibre8">eat</em> Christ’s body, and <em class="calibre8">drink</em> his blood. It’s no wonder that Christians in the early church were sometimes accused of being cannibals! Even we who know better than to make such an accusation are little put off by the intimate, boundary-less treatment of bodies around the Table. Perhaps it seems somehow sacrilegious to do too much chewing and gulping, which is why, I am sure, it is so often the case that only very small cubes of bread and only a few drops of grape juice are served. Some might even imagine it is more pious not to chew the bread at all, but simply to swallow it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_216" class="calibre7"></a>There is a christological heresy that is relevant here. It is the aforementioned heresy of docetism—the idea that Jesus was divine, but not really and truly human. In contradiction to the Chalcedonian Statement (see ch. 3), docetism thinks of Jesus’s humanity not as something true to who he is, but as a disguise he put on to cover up his divinity as he made his way through life and ministry. To try not to chew the communion bread, as though it is not actually bread, is actually a way of denying the humanity of God in Jesus Christ. It is, however inadvertently, a way of resisting the Christian confession that the Word was made flesh, that God is with us in the ordinary aspects of our days, and that our daily meals can actually facilitate our participation in Christ. When we believe God is with us, we can see the beautiful things in ordinary creation as holy. We tear off a big chunk of that bread—taking several bites, chewing and swallowing, remembering that Jesus Christ walked as a human being through history, died in body on the cross, and rose embodied from the grave. To have something to chew and swallow is always a great blessing to us creatures who need food in order to stay alive, but it is a particular means of grace on those occasions when we have trouble believing. All we have to do is chew, and swallow. These things we can usually do, even on days when we feel empty of faith. And doing these things, the communion liturgy reminds us, leads to our hearts being lifted up by the power of the Holy Spirit at work through the shared meal. Indeed, I have known more than one person who thought they had lost their hold on faith who found healing via the simple but profound gestures of eating and drinking at the Table of Christ.</p>
<p class="indent">The sacrament of baptism also deals intimately with bodies. It is a bath that washes away the dirt and stains (and in front of members of the community, who serve as witnesses) even as our new life in Christ is announced. I had a teacher in seminary who told us again and again that when we became ministers and baptized we should “always use a lot of water” and “make sure it is cold.” “When you baptize a baby,” he used to say, “crying is a good sign, not something to be avoided.” My teacher’s point was that making use of the blessing of ordinary cold water would have an extraordinary impact, heightening our awareness that something life- and world-changing happens every time a person is baptized.</p>

<p class="indent">For better and for worse, technologies make it possible for us to avoid leaving one community for another, and to continue developing communities even of people who have never seen each other face-to-face, and perhaps don’t even aspire ever to have such a meeting. If we cannot participate physically, we can at least be present virtually, and that’s better than nothing. The problem is, of course, there is a limit to how many communities we can invest in—isn’t there?</p>
<p class="indent">Thinking about this, I counted up the number of communities I consider myself to be part of and that regularly ask me to contribute service hours or (more commonly) financially. I did <em class="calibre8">not count</em> the couple dozen organizations that, in my view, are simply trying to lure me to donate because they know I care about their cause. My initial count is: five institutions of higher learning, eight schools and clubs my kids have participated in, and at least fifteen churches and church-related missions/outreaches in which I have had some kind of direct involvement. (My guess is that there are many of you, reading this, who would run similar numbers.) All claim to identify me as a member of their community, and seem to share resources with me as well as to request donations. But it is, frankly, impossible for me to give, financially, to every one of these communities—and even more impossible for me to invest in each of them the kind of time and life energy it would take to benefit from the resources they are extending to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the reality that finite beings do not have unlimited time and resources, I wonder: If a person has ten hours of time a week to invest in communities other than family or workplace,<a id="rch7en20" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en20" class="calibre5">20</a></sup> how many of these hours should be committed to the church? If someone commits to donating 10 percent<a id="rch7en21" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en21" class="calibre5">21</a></sup> of their income to charity, what percentage of that money should be given to the church? What theological argument would we make to support whatever answers we give to these questions? How is social media reshaping the ways we think about stewardship?</p>
<p class="indent">People who were invested in church communities in the United States back in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s yearn for the glory days when people <a id="page_218" class="calibre7"></a>were not continuously moving in and out of multiple communities, but settled into the communal life of a particular church. Gone is the time, it seems, when a family might go over to “the church on the corner” on several occasions a week—for worship, youth group, choir rehearsal, a meeting, a potluck supper. Who has time for that, today—we often reflect—with myriad communities making demands on our time and other resources?</p>
<p class="indent">People of faith recognize there is work to be done to figure out what it means, these days, to think of the church as a community of believers. What exactly is the nature of church community in this day when people are likely to invest a great deal of time, share the tough and joyous events of their lives, or agree to be mutually accountable for living holy lives before God? And is it hazardous to call the church a “community of believers” if we want to be sure to include people who do not believe—skeptics, seekers, partners, visitors, spouses?<a id="rch7en22" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en22" class="calibre5">22</a></sup> The desire to honor both inclusivity and particular identity in our thinking about church is an admirable one, but at some point these values might come into irreconcilable conflict.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps we should understand the church not only as a community of believers, but also as a community of faithful seekers. Understood as “the community of believers and seekers,” the church would be composed, then, of those who affirm God’s claim on them and those who, as yet, do not; of those who have already been baptized and those who have yet to be baptized; of those who express strong convictions about what they believe and those who are more skeptical; of those who have the “great faith” of the Canaanite woman<a id="rch7en23" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en23" class="calibre5">23</a></sup> and those who, like Nicodemus, have difficulty signing on but who keep showing up.</p>
<p class="indent">To think of those who are not yet baptized joining with those who are to together form the community called “church” will understandably raise <a id="page_219" class="calibre7"></a>the eyebrows of some. Baptism has traditionally been seen as the rite of entry <em class="calibre8">into</em> the church. This is true in the case of both infant baptism and believers’ baptism,<a id="rch7en24" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en24" class="calibre5">24</a></sup> despite how much disagreement there is about which practice is more faithful. When infant baptism is practiced, there is often a declaration made, at the time of baptism, that the child has officially become a member of the church community. When believers’ baptism is practiced, there is often mention made that the angels are now rejoicing, for the person has joined the church universal. While it is certainly the case that baptism marks the entry of individuals into the church, the point of it shouldn’t be to set up an exclusive club or leave others behind. Those who are not yet baptized are invited to join the celebration the way guests join in celebrating the love of those who are being wed. The guests in the wedding are not left out, but what they experience is different than what is experienced by the couple getting married.</p>
<h3 class="h2">W<small class="calibre3">HAT</small> M<small class="calibre3">AKES</small> C<small class="calibre3">HURCH</small></h3>
<p class="indent">This is not the first time in history we have struggled to figure out what constitutes “the church,” even if our current challenges are shaped, in unprecedented ways, by access to transportation, ubiquitous cell phones, and social media. In the sixteenth-century church reformers re-thought the traditional <em class="calibre8">four marks of the church</em>, as they were confessed in the Nicene Creed,<a id="rch7en25" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en25" class="calibre5">25</a></sup> because they were concerned that the Roman church of the day was invoking them in ways that detracted from recognizing the church as a concrete entity that exists in this world. The church is, as the Creed says: (1) one, (2) holy, (3) catholic (“universal”), and (4) apostolic, but it is seen and experienced “visibly” in this world, Calvin says, wherever and whenever “the Word is proclaimed and the sacraments rightly administered.”<a id="rch7en26" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en26" class="calibre5">26</a></sup> People of faith therefore can have confidence, when they go to worship and interact with members of a worshipping community, that—even when it is difficult to see the four marks in evidence—they are participating in the real thing, “true religion,”<a id="rch7en27" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en27" class="calibre5">27</a></sup> the body of Christ.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_220" class="calibre7"></a>As was mentioned in the introduction, in the context of discussing the increase in the number of people in the United States today who do not affiliate with any religious tradition, one of the most common criticisms of church communities is that they feel fake or hypocritical. Christians present themselves as having superlative values such as unconditional love, a forgiving spirit, and acceptance of all, yet the actual people <em class="calibre8">in</em> a church, on any given day, might act quite unloving, unforgiving, and unaccepting. The Reformers abhorred ecclesiastical docetism, insisting the community is real even when it harbors bad behaviors and even when its claimed identity seems distant from its on-the-ground life. By this they in no way meant to excuse incongruities, but rather wanted people to be able to lean into and see the beauty and possibilities for this world, a world that is more than a placeholder for what will someday come. The church is, they thought, a flesh-and-blood real-world community of struggling, hopeful people who confess belief in Jesus Christ, who repent of their sins, who together seek understanding of what it means to be “one, holy, catholic, and apostolic,” and who do these things concretely, by gathering to hear the Word and by partaking in the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p class="indent">Made up of “come as you are” people of hope, the church is an unusual place insofar as it claims us at one and the same time as sinners who are still in the process of working out our salvation and righteous ones who are already made whole in Christ. Church is not like the workplace, where we likely feel pressure to cover up or justify our sins and even our mistakes for the sake of avoiding litigation or ensuring our success. Nor is it like the proverbial after-hours hangout spot, where we join up with friends to vent our frustrations and, possibly, overindulge in ways that do not represent the better part of ourselves. The church, ideally, is a place where we are at one and the same time embraced as exactly as who we are and challenged to be the new creations God has made us.<a id="rch7en28" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en28" class="calibre5">28</a></sup> Again, this dialectic between acceptance and challenge is reminiscent of what we hope for from any home; to be a member of such a household is, in itself, one of the greatest of all blessings.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_221" class="calibre7"></a>And then come the blessings upon blessing. When we participate in a church where we are accepted and challenged, benefits<a id="rch7en29" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en29" class="calibre5">29</a></sup> are extended that minister to us in the current moment of our living and actively draw us to participate more deeply in relationship to God, through Christ, by the power of the Spirit. Through worshipping God, confessing our sin, listening to the sermon, praying for ourselves and others, affirming our faith, partaking of the sacraments, and being sent forth into the world, we have the invitation, opportunity, and support to practice being who we believe we truly are in Christ. God blesses us through the church with the resources we need to “work out” our salvation so we can know—and live out—the “good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.”<a id="rch7en30" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en30" class="calibre5">30</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where God Is Worshipped</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where God is regularly worshipped in the context of Christian community. The people of God gather on Sunday morning or at some other point during the week and focus their attention away from themselves and on the majesty of the God who made them. Sometimes, the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) is read as a celebration of the goodness of God’s Law. As disciples forgiven for breaking the law, those gathered for worship are now free to obey it,<a id="rch7en31" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en31" class="calibre5">31</a></sup> believing it is so beautiful and true that it can help us imagine, and step into, the Kingdom God so desires.<a id="rch7en32" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en32" class="calibre5">32</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Often, a hymn of praise is sung to begin the worship service. The presence of the Holy Spirit is invoked, even though Christians understand the Holy Spirit already to be in some sense the one who has gathered<a id="rch7en33" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en33" class="calibre5">33</a></sup> the people together and is hosting the entire event. The invocation serves to orient worshippers toward the reality of God’s power and blessings they believe already surrounds them but they desire better to perceive. “Spirit of the Living God, fall afresh on me,” worshippers sing,<a id="rch7en34" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en34" class="calibre5">34</a></sup> wanting to be open to whatever transformation God has in store for them as they listen for God’s Word and participate in the sacramental rites.</p>
<p class="indent">Worship takes place in the church, and the church is also present wherever worship takes place. If someone is out on a hike, “meditating” on the “wondrous works” of God,<a id="rch7en35" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en35" class="calibre5">35</a></sup> they might well be the only human <a id="page_222" class="calibre7"></a>being on the trail. Still, they are not worshipping alone. Standing in wonderment in the “theatre of God’s glory,”<a id="rch7en36" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en36" class="calibre5">36</a></sup> they are in company with the great <em class="calibre8">communion of saints</em> who are worshipping 24/7 before the throne of God. Any one of us and any particular congregation or worshipping community in any given instant might join explicitly in this ongoing worship, but we are part of it even when we are not worshipping—even when we cannot pray, sing, listen, wonder, or chew. And when we do engage in worship, we represent brothers and sisters who might not on that occasion be locally present, but to whom we are nonetheless joined, as members of our shared community, by the power of the Holy Spirit who makes us one. The whole church is, therefore, included in the worship of any one person or any particular congregation, and the worship of one never takes place apart from the whole.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where Sins Are Confessed and Forgiven</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where sins are confessed and the forgiveness of God is declared. It is also the place where we recommit to living in forgiving relationship to one another. While Christians from different traditions order worship differently, it is common practice to include a prayer of confession and <em class="calibre8">assurance of pardon</em> (or <em class="calibre8">declaration of forgiveness</em>) in the earlier parts of the worship service. This is no accident. A benefit of confessing sins at the beginning of the worship service is that confessors who have been reminded they have been justified in Christ will continue in worship as those who have been reoriented: they can see themselves, again, as God sees them. They are prepared, now, to receive the blessings that will subsequently flow. When the minister assures the people of God that their “sins are forgiven,” the way is clear for worshippers to be the new creations they are;<a id="rch7en37" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en37" class="calibre5">37</a></sup> to hear God’s new Word, to be strengthened anew at the Table; to participate in God’s vision for a new heaven and a new earth.</p>
<p class="indent">Confession and forgiveness of sins are meant to be regular practices in the life of the church, according to the third article (third part) of the Apostles’ Creed. Here, the Creed testifies to the reality of “the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.” If we had the idea <a id="page_223" class="calibre7"></a>that God is the one who brokers all forgiveness on our behalf and think to ourselves that this is a good thing, too, since we would never ourselves be capable of it, we had better take another look. Certainly, forgiveness is the work of God. But it is also our work, to be accomplished in the context of our home, the church.<a id="rch7en38" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en38" class="calibre5">38</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">One of the reasons we get nervous about promoting forgiveness in the life of the church is because the doctrine of forgiveness has too often been leveraged in ways that have done harm rather than promoting healing. When a survivor of abuse is pressured to “forgive and forget,” for example, this causes further brokenness to the person who has already been sinned against. It also harms the entire community, and is probably indicative of the fact that the church is trying to avoid getting involved in the work of restoration. But getting involved is the responsibility of all members of the household. Jesus is clear that the burden of forgiveness, in the context of the church, should not lie on the person who has been harmed, but rather on the community as a whole. Forgiveness, as he talks about it in the Gospels, is more of a dynamic process than a punctiliar action directed by one to another.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Gospel of Matthew, for example, Jesus tells the story of a king who forgives a servant a debt too great to fathom.<a id="rch7en39" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en39" class="calibre5">39</a></sup> But then the servant demands a fellow servant pay back to him a much smaller debt. When still other servants in the community witness the first servant’s treatment of the second, they report what has happened to the king. The king reacts by throwing the first servant in jail until he can pay back what he owes.</p>
<p class="indent">This parable is rich and worthy of close examination, as we work to formulate a theological understanding of forgiveness that serves to heal in the context of the church community. Notice that the participation of every character in the community of the story is necessary to the dynamic of forgiveness. Forgiveness is not up to the king alone. It is not enough that he forgives the debt of the first servant—forgiveness also requires that the first servant “step in” to what the king has done. Without the participation of the servant, the dynamic is incomplete; forgiveness has not yet occurred.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_224" class="calibre7"></a>The community of servants that witnesses the bad behavior of the first servant is also essential to the dynamic of forgiveness. It is only because they are paying attention to what is going on around them and have a heart for the marginalized that they spot the unmerciful act of the first servant toward the second. They take the risk of being told to mind their own business; they go and tell the king. This shows us once again that forgiveness is not something that is the responsibility only of the two people we surmise are the most obviously involved. Clearly, it is important, in the life of the community, that we watch out for one another and hold each other to account.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also the case that forgiveness, realized in the context of a community, does not at all require us to set justice to the side. On the contrary, the dynamics of forgiveness, properly understood, up the ante on the doing of justice and the loving of mercy. Consider this: in the story, we see that the forgiveness of the king actually changes the responsibility of the first servant to the second. If the king had not forgiven the first servant, what the first servant did to the second would have been okay. But the fact that forgiveness is opened wide to the first servant changes the rules, broadening the scope of mercy and justice. If only he had entered the dynamics of forgiveness, he and his behavior would of have been transformed.</p>
<p class="indent">What would churches be like, I wonder, if we all stepped together into the dynamics of forgiveness, forgiving one another as God forgives us? What difference would it make if churches could bring such practices into the life of the world? I suppose the short answer to this is: we would live in reconciled and reconciling relationship to one another, insisting on justice and extending mercy to all.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where the Word Is Proclaimed</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where the Word of God is proclaimed. For Christians who come from “active way” or <em class="calibre8">kataphatic</em><a id="rch7en40" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en40" class="calibre5">40</a></sup> traditions, the sermon is often considered the centerpiece of the service. Having opened worship with praise and been forgiven for our sins, we are now ready to listen for what God would like to say to us through the biblical witness. The preacher puts on her spectacles of Scripture and represents the people to whom she is <a id="page_225" class="calibre7"></a>preaching by helping her listeners look through the text at the world God desires to meet, make, and bless. Together the preacher and the people of God witness to where God is present and how God is at work. Where the Word is heard, the people of God are strengthened in their faith and challenged to act for God and on behalf of others.<a id="rch7en41" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en41" class="calibre5">41</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where There Is Confirmation and Intercession</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where our faith is strengthened and we are upheld in prayer. In the context of the community, the Holy Spirit “confirms” in our hearts and minds that we are the children of God, so that we can live our lives secure in that knowledge.<a id="rch7en42" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en42" class="calibre5">42</a></sup> This happens every time we witness a baptism, every time we partake of the bread and cup, and every time we hear or bear witness to the presence of God in our midst.</p>
<p class="indent">The church is where prayers of intercession are continuously offered. They are offered for all members, and they are offered for the whole world. As the children of God, we can pray about anything we want, at any time, and God promises to hear. Calvin called prayer, along these lines, the “chief exercise of faith.”<a id="rch7en43" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en43" class="calibre5">43</a></sup> And even if we cannot pray—if we are too weak, or too doubtful, or too unbelieving, we are still recipients of blessing. The Spirit promises to “intercede with groans and murmurings too deep for words” whenever we are stuck.<a id="rch7en44" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en44" class="calibre5">44</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where We Are Bathed</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where we are bathed. We are bathed by the water of baptism, in which our old selves are drowned and out of which we emerge to new life in Christ. To remember our baptisms is to live into our identity as children of God. In rituals of <em class="calibre8">baptismal renewal</em>, Christian believers remember their baptisms by renouncing evil and recommitting to living lives of discipleship.</p>
<p class="indent">Some Christian denominations engage habitually in another kind of bathing: footwashing. Mennonite Christians are among those who hold that footwashing is an ordinance disciples of Jesus are to practice regularly, following Jesus’s instruction to wash one another’s feet even as he washed <a id="page_226" class="calibre7"></a>the feet of the disciples.<a id="rch7en45" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en45" class="calibre5">45</a></sup> There are also Christians who engage the practice of footwashing once a year—on Maundy Thursday. While the waters of baptism identify us as the children of God, the waters of footwashing identify us as servants of one another, joined by our Lord who is Servant of All.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where We Are Fed</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where we are fed with Christ’s body and blood. While Christians understand in a variety of ways the relationship between the physical elements we chew and swallow and the actual body and blood of Christ, they agree that the Communion Table at which disciples partake is a place where we remember Christ’s life, death, and resurrection and we anticipate the promised Kingdom to come. Just as importantly, the Table is a place where we eat bread and drink wine or juice. Even when we have trouble believing Christ is present, we chew, we swallow, and our “hearts are lifted up . . . to God”<a id="rch7en46" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en46" class="calibre5">46</a></sup> by way of these concrete, physical actions. Further, justice is always in evidence at the Table. In a world in which one in nine people are starving,<a id="rch7en47" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en47" class="calibre5">47</a></sup> all are fed around the Table. To celebrate the Lord’s Supper is in this sense nothing short of a revolutionary act.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who care both about inclusivity and Christian identity recognize that these two values often stand in tension in the dynamics of the Table. The pressing question is: Who is the meal prepared for? Historically, many churches have held that the meal is intended for those who are baptized, only. The idea of this is not as much that baptism is a requirement for entry to the meal as that there is a logical order to our life together in Christian community: First, one is baptized into the communion of saints and then, one sups with them and with Jesus around the Table. Because, in our era, we value inclusivity, we are often critical of churches that are thought to “fence” the Table. Some churches, including the United Methodist Church, invite anyone who will to come, believing God might well choose to use the communion meal itself to draw a person to belief.<a id="rch7en48" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en48" class="calibre5">48</a></sup> Many churches have pastors who invite to the Table not only those who have been baptized, but also anyone who confesses faith in Christ. In the Presbyterian churches in which I am very involved, there is <a id="page_227" class="calibre7"></a>not any screening to determine who is baptized and who is not, to discern who believes, and who does not. The bread is served to all who come, but this after an invitation is issued to all believers.</p>
<p class="indent">I do think the Table is meant for believers, specifically. When Jesus told the disciples to “do this in remembrance of me,” he seemed to be assuming that those gathered around the Table would have a vested interest in who he is and his saving work.<a id="rch7en49" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en49" class="calibre5">49</a></sup> I also do believe it is possible to set the Table for Christian believers while still being inclusive. Last November I helped make a Thanksgiving dinner for my extended family members, not for everyone in general. I made three kinds of pie so everyone would have their favorite, and I was sure to serve my father’s mushrooms and my mother’s gravy. The meal was for my family, so I called my family (not anyone else) to the dinner. I like to think that, if someone showed up at the door who wasn’t invited, I would pull up a chair and give them a plate. They would partake of the meal, but they would be eating food that was prepared with my family in mind and extended to them. Similarly, when I as a minister preside at the Communion Table, I prepare for and invite those who self-identify as disciples of Christ. But when others come, I encourage the sharing of food, even as I believe Jesus himself would have.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where We Are Comforted and Exhorted</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where we are both comforted and exhorted. We are assured that our sins are forgiven in Jesus Christ. When we are sick or aggrieved we are supported in prayer. In some traditions we might be anointed with oil and experience the laying on of hands. Through these and other practices, members of a church community actively seek the healing action of the Holy Spirit for the bodies and spirits of those who are sick and broken.</p>
<p class="indent">As those who are “forgiven, healed, and made whole,”<a id="rch7en50" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en50" class="calibre5">50</a></sup> we are charged to live as the children of God we are, obeying God’s laws freely and serving one another in love. We are affirmed in our gifts and then challenged to develop and to share them. The church is where all gifts are considered equally essential to the life of the community, but where those called to <a id="page_228" class="calibre7"></a>the ministries of preaching, teaching, or pastoral care might be ordained and charged to the particular work of pastors, elders, and deacons.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where We Work and Hope</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is where we work and hope in freedom, remembering that all of our efforts are provisional. In other words, the church has neither the capacity to nor the burden of speaking univocally about God or what God is up to in the world. The church does speak and act, but sometimes makes mistakes, and will never bring the Kingdom of God to earth as it is in heaven on its own. This is a relief and a blessing for the church, which should therefore feel no pressure to be some smaller version of the Messiah—that job’s been taken! To remember that we await the coming of the Christ who is absent, to watch and pray and do the work we believe is of God, without the burden of trying to prove we’re always right, is a true blessing. And it will be followed up with another. Our efforts might be provisional, but the promise is that they are also essential to the divine work. Thus, when Christ returns again (whatever form that takes) he will turn to the church and say, “Well done, my good and faithful servant.”<a id="rch7en51" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en51" class="calibre5">51</a></sup> And the church’s joy will be complete.<a id="rch7en52" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en52" class="calibre5">52</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre13">Where We Are Charged and Blessed</em></h4>
<p class="indent">The church is the place where we are charged and blessed, sent forth to share the benefits we have received with the world that God so loves. When we are charged, at the end of the worship service to (for example) “do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God”<a id="rch7en53" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en53" class="calibre5">53</a></sup> we are reminded that the blessings we enjoy as members of the household are not our own personal possessions, but God’s gifts to all. What we experience in church is “a parable and a promise to the whole world . . . a provisional representation of all humanity justified and reconciled to God.”<a id="rch7en54" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en54" class="calibre5">54</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the Christian worship service, the charge is always followed by a benediction, or blessing. Often it is trinitarian in structure: “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with us both now and forever more.” The <a id="page_229" class="calibre7"></a>benediction signals that the instruction the church gives us to go out into the world does not serve to “pause” God’s presence with us, as if we came to church to be refueled and are now headed out to use up our resources, at which point we will return. On the contrary, this blessing of the church reminds us that God is with us wherever we go, empowering us by way of the Spirit to do the work of Christ’s disciples.</p>
<p class="indent">The joining of charge to the blessing of Christ’s presence is evident throughout the New Testament witness, particularly in Matthew 28, frequently called the “Great Commission.” Here, just before Christ’s ascension, he commissions the disciples to “go and make disciples of all nations,”<a id="rch7en55" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch7en55" class="calibre5">55</a></sup> immediately assuring them that this work is not to be done in response for God’s good gifts, but as an extension of their relationship to him. It is because we have and will always have the blessing of God’s presence that we are able to go forth. “And behold I am with you always,” Jesus promises, “even unto the end of the age.”</p>

<p class="indent">In the next chapter we continue discussing the ways God blesses us by considering the doctrine of the Christian life. While this chapter on the church has reflected on the matter of how God blesses us by way of our embodied engagement in the practices of Christian community, the next chapter takes a slightly different and more meditative approach. It reflects on the journey and struggle we have as human beings seeking to live as those we claim to be. It acknowledges how difficult it is to walk through a day, week, or lifetime remembering one’s baptism; knowing one is loved; believing one is forgiven. What does it look like, really, to be filled with the Spirit, to abide in Christ, to walk humbly with God? How we live in light of the faith we hold is, for many of us, the most pressing question of all.</p>
