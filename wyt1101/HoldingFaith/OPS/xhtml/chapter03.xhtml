<p class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="../images/common.jpg" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Up until now we have been talking about what theologians like to call <em class="calibre8">prolegomena</em>, which literally means “words that come before.” Technically speaking, we have been speaking the words and exploring the concepts that must be engaged before we move on to talking about the incarnation, the Trinity, and the Holy Spirit; before we discuss creation, sin, and salvation; before we consider the challenges of grace, Christian life, and church; before we ponder our vocation as well as what it means to <a id="page_73" class="calibre7"></a>be people of hope. We couldn’t really consider all of these things, in good faith, without reflecting on how we are thinking and what approach we would take. Now that we have discussed the character of our theological language and the norms and sources we go to as we discern what words we will say about God, we are ready to move on to speaking about who God is. But how shall we begin?</p>
<h3 class="h2">B<small class="calibre3">EGINNING WITH</small> J<small class="calibre3">ESUS</small></h3>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, theologians have been known to start speaking about God in at least a couple of different ways. Some start right in with discussing the attributes of God: God is <em class="calibre8">omnipotent</em> (or all-powerful), <em class="calibre8">omniscient</em> (or all-knowing), <em class="calibre8">omnipresent</em> (everywhere present), and <em class="calibre8">immutable</em> (unchanging), for example. After establishing what God is like, these theologians then go on to discuss how God reaches out to us by creating us, by becoming flesh and entering into existence with us, or by comforting and guiding us by way of the Holy Spirit. Thomas and Calvin are two theologians who take this approach. This is also the tack taken by many creeds and confessions that have been passed on, by, and to Christian believers through the ages. Consider, for example, the Westminster catechism, which by question #4 is asking students the weighty question, “What is God?” Interestingly, the prescribed answer speaks to the difficulty we have answering it, given our creaturely limitations. Rather, it insists that we—with Scripture in hand—may answer confidently that God is “a Spirit who is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.”<a id="rch3en3" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en3" class="calibre5">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The catch to this catechetical approach is that it can be easy to forget, in the course of learning and rehearsing very good theological answers to huge and complex questions, that it is impossible to know God in and of ourselves, on the basis of our own best logic. As we said in the last chapter, any knowledge we have of what God is like comes from God showing us what God is like. Even when we <em class="calibre8">can</em> list off the divine attributes, as we <a id="page_74" class="calibre7"></a>have learned them from Scripture (and perhaps the catechism), it is another thing to be able to say what these attributes mean about who God is and how God acts, as well as why they matter to our lives of faith. I remember, for example, how Peter is able to give the right answer to who Jesus is. But he actually has no idea what he is talking about. “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!” he tells Jesus, who confirms that this answer is “from heaven.”<a id="rch3en4" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en4" class="calibre5">4</a></sup> But Peter makes a false assumption about what this means. He thinks that Jesus—and all who stand with Jesus, including himself—will manage to escape the persecution that is right around the corner. This, of course, is not the case. This story about Peter reminds us that giving the right answers can actually get in the way of understanding what they are all about, especially when we make the false assumption that, because we are “right,” we are powerful and protected. As surprising as this is both to Peter and to us: to be the Son of the living God means suffering more, not less.</p>
<p class="indent">Even Calvin makes the mistake of over-knowing what God is like before he explores the content of God’s revelatory acts.<a id="rch3en5" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en5" class="calibre5">5</a></sup> This should give us pause, I think, given that Calvin is a theologian who so beautifully makes the point that we can know God only because God accommodates us when we are too bleary-eyed to perceive God on our own! God speaks baby-talk to us, Calvin says, as a caretaker speaks to a child, all for the purpose of helping us understand.<a id="rch3en6" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en6" class="calibre5">6</a></sup> Yet Calvin at the same time does not hesitate to rehearse the attributes of God fairly early on in his <em class="calibre8">Institutes</em>, assuming his readers will grasp their meaning and significance apart from offering us any practical handles for understanding.<a id="rch3en7" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en7" class="calibre5">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The unintended consequences caused by beginning our talk about God with delineating and defining God’s attributes are evident when Calvin reflects on certain biblical passages that seem to depict God in ways that contradict the description of God he has already presented. Calvin, at these points, seems forced to turn exegetical cartwheels in order to reconcile what he has already said about God’s nature with the texts he is considering. Calvin assumes, for example, that God is <em class="calibre8">impassible</em>—unaffected by anyone or anything.<a id="rch3en8" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en8" class="calibre5">8</a></sup> He says this because he surmises, alongside many theologians who have gone before him, that divine <em class="calibre8">impassibility</em>—the idea <a id="page_75" class="calibre7"></a>that God is unaffected by anything—is a logical extension of the divine <em class="calibre8">immutability</em>, the idea that God is unchanging. To be affected is to change, Calvin is thinking, therefore the unchanging God must not be affected, and is therefore impassible.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem is, there are many passages in Scripture where God <em class="calibre8">is</em> affected by us because God loves us and wants us to be faithful. God sends the flood in the Genesis story, for example, because God is affected by humanity’s sinfulness and feels a need to act.<a id="rch3en9" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en9" class="calibre5">9</a></sup> God listens and makes adjustments, when Abraham negotiates for the city of Sodom to be saved if there are a remnant of faithful left.<a id="rch3en10" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en10" class="calibre5">10</a></sup> Jesus, whom Calvin believes is God incarnate, is affected by the death of Lazarus, weeping at Lazarus’s tomb.<a id="rch3en11" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en11" class="calibre5">11</a></sup> In an effort to reconcile cases like these with what he has already said about God’s impassibility, Calvin proposes that the biblical writers are making use of <em class="calibre8">anthropomorphisms</em>. In other words, he suggests, the descriptions of God being responsive to what we hope for and feel are included in the biblical witness only for the benefit of our understanding, not because God <em class="calibre8">actually is</em> affected. This is a confusing and even dangerous proposal, from the vantage point of Calvin’s own theological method. If we put on the “spectacles of Scripture” <em class="calibre8">before</em> attempting to describe God’s character, it will be difficult to conclude God is unaffected by the creaturely world that God so loves.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of the problems created by defining the divine attributes prior to contemplating God’s revelatory actions in human history, other theologians begin their discussions of who God is by reflecting on God’s character always by way of God’s acts. Elizabeth A. Johnson, for example, begins speaking about the God who is mystery by testifying to how God has met us, in our day-to-day lives, by way of the Spirit. Johnson begins with the Spirit, she explains, in part because she understands God’s acts in the person of the Holy Spirit to be neglected, particularly in the theological reflections of the Western world.<a id="rch3en12" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en12" class="calibre5">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The most commonly engaged entry point for talking about the character of God, once we have eschewed beginning with a list of divine attributes, is God’s dramatic entrance into existence with us in the person of Jesus Christ. Barth notes, along these lines, that the Word-become-flesh in <a id="page_76" class="calibre7"></a>the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth is the central event of God’s self-revelation. Barth’s approach to ordering Christian doctrines, in contrast to Calvin’s approach,<a id="rch3en13" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en13" class="calibre5">13</a></sup> is to begin with God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ and to move on to discussion of the attributes of God only in the context of remembering Jesus Christ’s life and work.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s one example of how beginning with Jesus, rather than with our very best definitions of the divine attributes, might make a difference: If we begin talking about God’s power and then only after that consider Jesus Christ as the Word made flesh, we might find ourselves trying to figure out how Christ’s suffering on the cross can possibly be reconciled with the portrait of a God who is the almighty and sovereign Creator. But if we reflect on what Jesus’s suffering and death teaches us about the character of God before we try to articulate what it means to say God is all-powerful, then the cross and all it stands for will shape our understanding of what God’s power is like. If we recognize that Emmanuel has entered into the depths of creaturely frailty and desolation, our understanding of what it means to say God is “all-powerful” will be informed and transformed. As Daniel Migliore notes, we will be far less likely to characterize God as a God of “sheer power” if we found our considerations in the story of Jesus Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.<a id="rch3en14" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en14" class="calibre5">14</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="h2">T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> W<small class="calibre3">ITNESS OF THE</small> G<small class="calibre3">OSPELS</small></h3>
<p class="indent">What words shall we say about the central mystery of the Christian faith, that the Word became flesh in the person of Jesus Christ? We might be tempted to begin straightaway with the New Testament Gospel stories about the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth, whom Christians believe is God incarnate. But before we leap to those stories we will want to take note—following the lead of Matthew and Luke—that Jesus of Nazareth came from a particular nation, a particular people, a particular context—just as any other person who has ever walked on the face of this planet. Jesus was a Palestinian Jew, a member of the nation of Israel, God’s chosen <a id="page_77" class="calibre7"></a>people from a time long before Jesus’s birth. To remember this is to remember that the Judeo-Christian God is a God of real, on-the-ground history, that the God Christians know in Jesus Christ is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God who has been involved in the workings of humanity since the very beginning. To be thinking of Jesus Christ in the context of the broad history of God’s saving work is also to recognize that God acts even after the events of the resurrection. “The whole creation has been groaning” for redemption,<a id="rch3en15" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en15" class="calibre5">15</a></sup> Romans insists, and the book of Acts, the Epistles, and the Apostles’ Creed all bear witness to the movement of the Spirit in the life of the church, who waits and works for an historical manifestation of God’s coming Kingdom.<a id="rch3en16" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en16" class="calibre5">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Where does the particular person of Jesus enter this expansive picture of God’s salvation history? Looking at Matthew and Luke, we might well argue we should start at Bethlehem or a little earlier, perhaps at the point when Gabriel comes to Mary to tell her she will conceive by way of the Spirit. This is where the <em class="calibre8">incarnation</em> of God in the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth begins, concretely—with God’s determination to enter Mary’s womb and be born. “The Holy Spirit will come over you,” Gabriel says. “Therefore, the one who is to be born will be holy. He will be called God’s Son.”<a id="rch3en17" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en17" class="calibre5">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">We don’t know much about Mary before that announcement, but there is good reason to suppose she is utterly transformed by the news Gabriel brings her. She visits Elizabeth; she prophesies and sings. She realizes and testifies that everything has changed—the hungry have been filled; the rich have been sent away; kingdoms are reversed. Already, as the baby Jesus readies to be born, the incarnation of God in Mary’s womb has begun the shaping of a new story that is not a different story than the story of God’s redemption of Israel, but is more, I think, than simply the next chapter of the same story. Perhaps we might liken it to the beginning of a sequel that tells the same story from the vantage point of a different community in a different time and context. Mary is the Miriam<a id="rch3en18" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en18" class="calibre5">18</a></sup> of the sequel. She, like Miriam of the first book, celebrates that the intervention of God in creaturely history means an overhauling of power structures that clears space for marginalized and underprivileged people to flourish. <a id="page_78" class="calibre7"></a>“I will sing to the L<small class="calibre15">ORD</small>, for an overflowing victory!” sings Miriam, celebrating the escape of the Israelites from the Egyptians. “Horse and rider [God] threw into the sea!”<a id="rch3en19" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en19" class="calibre5">19</a></sup> Mary, basking in the good news that she is an essential participant in God’s saving work, proclaims that God “has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty-handed.”<a id="rch3en20" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en20" class="calibre5">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This beginning of the event we will eventually come to recognize as the incarnation next touches down in Bethlehem, where the baby Jesus is born. Converging on the scene there, as all the Western world knows, are the star, the shepherds, the magi, and the various and sundry animals who happen to carry family or friends of Jesus on their backs, tag along with the shepherds, or reside in the barn (perhaps, even, sleeping in the manger). Mary, Joseph, and Elizabeth may have experienced the beginning of something new when Mary conceived Jesus, but Bethlehem is the moment when a host of others begin to see everything differently. “A Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord,” has been born. <a id="rch3en21" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en21" class="calibre5">21</a></sup> This is good news meant for the entire world.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to starting at the beginning, in relation to the incarnation, the Gospels of Luke and Matthew have far more caché with those who hold faith than does the Gospel of Mark. Mark’s Gospel, almost certainly written first, does not have the angels, the shepherds, or the magi. It doesn’t have the story of the Annunciation—the visit of Gabriel to Mary. Instead, it first notes Jesus’s inextricable relationship with God about thirty years later, at the time of his baptism by John. The dove descends; the voice from heaven is heard; it seems that Mark’s understanding of the character of incarnation comes close to <em class="calibre8">adoptionism</em>, the idea that Jesus was not yet the Son of God at the time of his birth, but that God the Father adopted Jesus of Nazareth as his child because Jesus was so faithful and true. While of course Mark’s depiction of Jesus has as much value for our understanding of who Jesus is as the other Gospels, I have yet to see it used as the basis of an Advent play the kids present on the Sunday before Christmas!</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting that Matthew and Luke, the two Gospels we believe were written next after Mark, make a special point of extending further back in time the coming of God to the world in the person of Jesus Christ. <a id="page_79" class="calibre7"></a>Biblical scholars surmise that the inclusion of the stories centered in Bethlehem is accounted for, in part, by the fact that Matthew and Luke likely shared a text Mark didn’t have and that we no longer have. (Scholars identify this hypothetical text as “Q”).<a id="rch3en22" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en22" class="calibre5">22</a></sup> But Matthew and Luke do more than simply include the birth narrative in their Gospels. They seem, actually, to <em class="calibre8">celebrate</em> the story, even as we celebrate it every Christmas. The story of Mary, Gabriel, Elizabeth, and Joseph; the story of the angels, the shepherds, the magi, and King Herod—these stories help make sense of who Jesus is and what he did next. Matthew tells the stories giving special attention to how they connect Jesus to what has come before, explaining how his birth fulfills the prophecies valued by the Israelites. Luke makes sure to highlight, for his part, that Jesus’s solidarity with the poor and disenfranchised begins with his entering into this world as someone who is poor and disenfranchised—his birth occurs in a place clearly unsuitable, to a mother who would likely be viewed with disdain by those who pride themselves on being privileged.</p>
<p class="indent">If Luke and Matthew find it meaningful and even essential to begin consideration of Jesus’s relationship with God by backing up to the beginning of his earthly life, John pushes back in time further, still. When you reflect on the prologue to his Gospel you can almost imagine John pacing around his desk and thinking to himself:<a id="rch3en23" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en23" class="calibre5">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="blockquotet">How can I get across, to my readers, just how far back this connection between Jesus, God, and the world they know and appreciate goes? Matthew and Luke did better than Mark, to be sure. . . . But I’d like to pull it back even further. . . . How can I convey that what is going on with Jesus has no beginning . . . that he reveals an eternal truth about who God is as well as what God has done . . . ? Let’s see . . . I’ve got it! I’ll connect Jesus to what goes all the way back as far as our religious tradition has been able to fathom. I’ll draw a parallel between talking about where Jesus came from and God’s relationship to creation itself. Instead of starting with “in the beginning God” I’ll start with “in the beginning was the Word.” They’ll never read Genesis 1 the same way, again!</p>
<p class="noindentt">I imagine John then sitting down at his desk to write, excited about drawing so many important parallels: between the creation of the world and the <a id="page_80" class="calibre7"></a>presence of the Word, both in the beginning; between the Word and the <em class="calibre8">logos</em>, both ways of naming the creative pulse of the cosmos; between the eternal Word and the historical figure of Jesus, the listeners’ relationship to the latter making possible their relationship to the former, since Jesus <em class="calibre8">is</em> the Word incarnate. I imagine John writing in the hope that he will help us see the event of Jesus as essential to the beginning and ending of all things.</p>
<h3 class="h2">J<small class="calibre3">OHN AND THE</small> E<small class="calibre3">MERGING</small> D<small class="calibre3">OCTRINE OF</small> I<small class="calibre3">NCARNATION</small></h3>
<p class="indent">Given that John associates the historical Jesus with the creation of all that is, it is not surprising that John is the Gospel most drawn upon to develop understandings of incarnation that emphasize the inextricable connection between the human and divine natures of Jesus. Jesus is the one in whom the “Word” (<em class="calibre8">logos</em>) became flesh, John says. This Word his readers would have recognized as the organizing principle of the universe. It is the power by which, it was thought, everything is made and operates. To connect this historical person, Jesus of Nazareth, to it must have seemed to some to be quite outlandish. For others who had experienced Jesus, it may have actually explained a lot. “Oh—that makes sense,” I can imagine someone saying, as they begin reading John. “This helps me better understand the stories I’ve heard about Jesus.”</p>
<p class="indent">Very important to John is that we continue thinking of Jesus as a historical, embodied figure even as we recognize his integral role in creation itself. John’s goal, in introducing his Gospel, is in no way to reveal Jesus as some sort of God disguised by flesh, as though who he is as a human being is only a cover over his true self. Rather, what makes Jesus’s connection to eternity so interesting to John, and what makes him think his readers’ relationship to Jesus can transform them, is precisely the fact that the Jesus who indeed does “dwell among us” as a fellow human being is also essential to the existence of creation itself. Jesus has, after all, “dwelt among us” <a id="page_81" class="calibre7"></a>as one who is also “flesh.”<a id="rch3en24" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en24" class="calibre5">24</a></sup> As it says in 1 John (traditionally ascribed to the same author as the Gospel), Jesus is a historical figure whom we have “seen with our eyes” and “with our hands handled.”<a id="rch3en25" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en25" class="calibre5">25</a></sup> In John’s distinctive telling of the good news, Jesus chats with Nicodemus and with the Samaritan woman at the well;<a id="rch3en26" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en26" class="calibre5">26</a></sup> he cries, aggrieved, at Lazarus’s tomb;<a id="rch3en27" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en27" class="calibre5">27</a></sup> he shows Thomas, after his resurrection, his hands and his side.<a id="rch3en28" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en28" class="calibre5">28</a></sup> Clearly, John has no interest in compromising one iota on Jesus’s existence as a human being who lived on this earth as our neighbor, eating and visiting, feeling and relating. It is precisely this real-life one—this one whom we know because he shares in life with us—who joins us to God, John insists.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, according to John’s prologue, the one we know as the human being called “Jesus” was also around in the beginning, and the one who played a part in creating us from the beginning is the one who then became flesh in the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth. This two-directional insight of John’s probably did more than any other to provoke the formation of the doctrine of incarnation. By two-directional, I mean that the insight moves both from our knowing Jesus in the context of our world through to the truth of his connection with God; and from the reality of his eternal existence—before time was even created!—through to our knowing of him within the confines of creaturely history. We know Jesus, having encountered him as our neighbor; and it is just this one who was with God in the beginning—way before the fact of our knowing him. Conversely, it is the Word who was with God in the beginning who took on flesh so that we might come to be in relationship with him. Without his historic existence there would be no contact and therefore no clear perception. Without his eternal connection, our historical relationship with Jesus would offer us no immediate access to the life of God.</p>
<p class="indent">For John, as for the doctrine of incarnation, to know Jesus is to know God. “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father,” Jesus tells Philip in chapter 14, going on to explain that he is in the Father and the Father is in him.<a id="rch3en29" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en29" class="calibre5">29</a></sup> While people of faith have argued for centuries about what this statement means precisely, there can be no doubt that it connotes the closest possible relationship between God and Jesus. It is reflection on what constitutes the character of this relationship, what difference it makes to <a id="page_82" class="calibre7"></a>our understanding of God, and what difference it makes to our lives of faith that precipitated the earliest debates and decisions about doctrine. We will consider a couple of the most important of these now: the first is the framing decision that Jesus is of the same substance as the Father; the second is that Jesus is not half human and half divine, but fully human and fully divine. We turn now to considering each of these theological developments. As the Word became real flesh and walked around in history in the person of Jesus, so the teachings about him were developed on the ground—in real life, in the real early church, and with all the politics that come with real human beings when they come together to work out the details of something that matters to them all.</p>
<h3 class="h2">T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> I<small class="calibre3">NSIGHT OF</small> N<small class="calibre3">ICEA</small></h3>
<p class="indent">In the earliest centuries of the church, people of faith were of course invested in trying to figure out what it meant to confess Jesus as Lord. Who is this one the church identified as Savior, and how is it that we can claim him as the Messiah without compromising on our conviction that there is only one God? By the third and fourth centuries several Gospels were circulating, but Mark, Matthew, Luke/Acts, and John had already emerged as the four that were considered to be authoritative. These Gospels, particularly the Gospel of John, were cited frequently in the discussions and debates in which ecumenical statements about Jesus Christ’s identity were formulated.</p>
<p class="indent">Athanasius, a fourth-century scholar, is one of the theologians who draws heavily on the Gospel of John, frequently citing Jesus’s comment to Philip that “I am in the Father and the Father is in me” as he makes the case for the nature of Jesus’s relationship to God.<a id="rch3en30" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en30" class="calibre5">30</a></sup> Athanasius holds that Jesus shares in the very “stuff” or “substance” of God. The term he uses for this, a term that did not originate with him but with which he is associated because he argues for it so persuasively, is <em class="calibre8">homoousios</em>. This term means, etymologically speaking, “of the same stuff” (<em class="calibre8">homo</em> = “same” <a id="page_83" class="calibre7"></a>and <em class="calibre8">ousia</em> = “stuff or substance”). Athanasius noticed that Jesus spoke not only of being in close proximity to the Father, but of the two mutually indwelling one another, virtually sharing each other’s lives and work. He offered his arguments for the <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em><a id="rch3en31" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en31" class="calibre5">31</a></sup> against a very persuasive opposing view: the teaching of Arius that Jesus was very near to God, indeed, but didn’t, actually, share the same substance with God. Taking Arius’s concerns and perspective into account and in contrast to the Athanasian <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em>, it was proposed that Jesus was <em class="calibre8">homoiousios</em> with God. Notice that this term is different by just one vowel—it has an <em class="calibre8">i</em> after the second <em class="calibre8">o</em>. To say Jesus is <em class="calibre8">homoiousios</em> with the Father is to claim he is of <em class="calibre8">like</em> substance, but not exactly the <em class="calibre8">same</em> substance. One of the strengths of maintaining that Jesus and the Father were different in substance, Arius and his followers thought, was that monotheism would not be jeopardized. They were concerned that saying Jesus was of the same stuff as the Father God would establish Jesus as a second divinity, and that Christianity would then shift away from monotheism, which everyone agreed would be deeply problematic. Eventually, the doctrine of the Trinity developed as a way of explaining how it is that people of faith confess Jesus is <em class="calibre8">homo-ousios</em> with the Father without compromising on the oneness of the Godhead. (Why this matters so much to our lives of faith is the subject of the following chapter.) Arius did not find tenable the idea that God could be at once both one and distinct.</p>
<p class="indent">Another concern raised, by those more inclined toward Arius’s view<a id="rch3en32" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en32" class="calibre5">32</a></sup> than the Athanasian <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em>, is that to think of Jesus as being just as fully God as God the Father would be to compromise on both his humanity and his divinity. If Jesus of Nazareth were of the same substance as the Father, Athanasius’s opponents suggested, this would mean he couldn’t really, actually, be human. Jesus would really be God-in-disguise, they posited, with all the human sorts of things Jesus did being more or less illusion. If Jesus were <em class="calibre8">homoousios</em> with the Father, for example, his suffering could not have been real suffering, since God is impassible and cannot suffer, Arius’s supporters emphasized.</p>
<p class="indent">But Athanasius remained steadfastly against his opponents on this point, insisting that the <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em> compromised neither on the character <a id="page_84" class="calibre7"></a>of Jesus’s humanity nor the integrity of his divinity. “He has not ceased to be God by reason of becoming human, and he does not flee from things human because he is God,”<a id="rch3en33" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en33" class="calibre5">33</a></sup> he wrote. That humanity and divinity coexisted in the person of Jesus Christ with no compromise to either, Athanasius believed, was both the testimony of the Gospels and the Epistles and supported by logical argument about the necessity of the <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em> for salvation itself. Famously, Athanasius drew an analogy between the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ and a king moving into the neighborhood of his subjects. Just as the subjects of a king would feel protected by the presence of the king only if the king were actually the king and not only an especially benevolent neighbor, so Jesus Christ offers consolation to us only if and because he is God incarnate, not one who is only an awfully lot like God.<a id="rch3en34" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en34" class="calibre5">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">At the Council of Nicea in 325, people of faith gathered, argued, and struggled with this question of the <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em> because they believed who Jesus Christ <em class="calibre8">is</em> matters to how they understood the character of their relationship to God. The idea that Jesus was of the <em class="calibre8">same</em> and not <em class="calibre8">similar</em> substance to the Father was received by the majority of those voting at Nicea as the measure of orthodoxy. The Nicene decision did not of course stop the debate about the nature of the Son’s relationship to the Father, which raged on for centuries. But it did serve to anchor, and also to precipitate, many of the crucial doctrinal discussions and decisions made over the next 125 years. At the Synod of Alexandria (362 CE) and the Council of Constantinople (381 CE), for example, people of faith asked themselves the question: Is it only the Son who is of the same substance with the Father? Ultimately, they declared that the Holy Spirit, with the Father and the Son, was also and equally divine. At the Council of Chalcedon, in 451, people of faith returned to the specific matter of how to relate Jesus Christ’s humanity and divinity. Having decided that the Son shared the same substance with the Father, this next question made sense. How is it, exactly, that Jesus Christ is human and divine at one and the same time, and what difference does this make to us, in our lives of faith?</p>
<h3 class="h2"><a id="page_85" class="calibre5"></a>T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> W<small class="calibre3">ISDOM OF</small> C<small class="calibre3">HALCEDON</small></h3>
<p class="indent">At the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the order of the day was to figure out how it is that the two natures of Jesus Christ can coexist in his one person. What was at stake for those present was not to undo the mystery of who Jesus Christ is, as though Jesus were a kind of riddle that requires the best of our problem-solving energies. Rather, those who were present were people of faith seeking understanding; people who believed that grappling with this impossible-to-resolve theological question would facilitate their participation in the mystery of it. What was at stake at Chalcedon was, actually, the matter of perceiving and participating in salvation itself. The question “How can there be a perception of Jesus Christ and our being in Him?”<a id="rch3en35" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en35" class="calibre5">35</a></sup> was layered just underneath the question of how we are to understand the human nature and the divine nature to coexist in Christ.</p>
<p class="indent">This very personal motivation for pursuing understanding of Jesus Christ’s person is sometimes ignored as historical and theological details about Chalcedon are rehearsed. And yet the fact that a concern about salvation drove the deliberations is evident even in the final statement produced. This “Chalcedonian Statement,” as it is known, recognizes Jesus as “one person in two natures” who is “begotten of the Father before the ages” in relation to his divinity and “born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God” in relation to his humanity. Crystal clear in the text of the Statement itself is that the fact the begotten one is born and the divine one is human is “for our sake and the sake of our salvation.”<a id="rch3en36" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en36" class="calibre5">36</a></sup> Salvation is accomplished, in fact, precisely by virtue of the fact that our one Savior is at once both begotten and born, fully divine and fully human.</p>
<p class="indent">The Statement then closes by giving what I understand to be a setting of parameters that are intended, at least in part, to help people of faith participate in the mystery of Jesus Christ’s person. Noticing that there was a tendency of some, in the context of the Chalcedonian debate, to think of Jesus’s humanity and divinity as “merging” or “mingling” together, the statement insists, correcting this, that Jesus is fully human and fully divine “without confusing” the two natures and “without change” to either of them.<a id="rch3en37" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en37" class="calibre5">37</a></sup> Noticing that there was a tendency of some to try to find ways <a id="page_86" class="calibre7"></a>to protect the integrity of Jesus Christ’s immutable divinity from his suffering humanity,<a id="rch3en38" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en38" class="calibre5">38</a></sup> the Statement also proclaims that his two natures are related to each other “without separation and without division.” Again, the authors’ concern was not only to reconcile the opposing streams in the debate but also to reflect the consensus that Jesus Christ, in his very person, saves us.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to see the idea of <em class="calibre8">salvation</em> in the context of the statement as a whole, I offer here a significantly abbreviated version that draws together some key phrases relevant to the discussion we have had of it so far:</p>
<p class="blockquotet">Jesus Christ is . . . one person in two natures . . . fully human and fully divine. In relation to his divinity, he was begotten of the Father before the ages. In relation to his humanity, this very same one was born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, <strong class="calibre9">for our sake and the sake of our salvation</strong>. The two natures are united without confusion and without change, without separation and without division.<a id="rch3en39" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en39" class="calibre5">39</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindentt">Notice that the explicit mention of salvation is made just after it has been emphasized that “the very same one” who was born of Mary is the one who is “begotten of the Father before the ages.” Somehow, it is the person of Jesus Christ himself who saves. Below we will turn to the “so what?” of all this, seeking to lay claim to the value of Chalcedon for our lives of faith, today. But first it is important that we pause and notice that something we generally see as absolutely essential to any talk of salvation is notably absent. What happened, we might ask, to the cross?</p>
<h3 class="h2">T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> E<small class="calibre3">MPHASIS OF</small> C<small class="calibre3">HALCEDON</small></h3>
<p class="indent">We might well have expected that a statement concerned with salvation would somewhere mention Christ’s work on the cross. Perhaps, if we had been asked to edit the statement, we would have suggested that one five-word phrase be added, so the statement would read: “this very same one was born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God; <em class="calibre8">he died on the cross</em> for our sake and the sake of our salvation.” But those words are not there. <a id="page_87" class="calibre7"></a>From where we stand in history, it might seem as though it must have been an accident to leave the cross out, if what is being talked about is <em class="calibre8">salvation</em>. However differently we interpret the crucifixion, we might remark, don’t all Christians believe that it is by way of the cross that Jesus saves us? If so, why is it, then, that the Chalcedonian statement emphasizes salvation with no mention of the cross whatsoever?</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="chapter06.xhtml" class="calibre7">chapter 6</a> we will explore in greater detail the doctrine of the <em class="calibre8">atonement</em> and current controversies and creative suggestions for how to interpret the cross. For now, however, I’m hoping that if we simply notice that the way the Chalcedonians were thinking about salvation in relation to <em class="calibre8">who Jesus was</em> than in relation to <em class="calibre8">what he did</em>, we will become curious. Again, instead of talking about how Jesus saves us by dying on the cross and rising from the dead, Chalcedon speaks of Jesus’s saving work being accomplished by way of his two natures being joined in one person.</p>
<p class="indent">Why is this the emphasis at Chalcedon? Isn’t the important thing not so much who Jesus Christ is as what he did? In a world where we value doing and accomplishing almost to the point of understanding people to <em class="calibre8">be</em> what they <em class="calibre8">do</em>, it makes sense that we might want to move on quickly from Chalcedon to reviewing the events of Jesus’s life, pondering his teachings, marveling at the miracles he performed, and standing, awestruck, before the cross and the empty tomb. We think that’s where the real action is, don’t we? We assume it is finally by way of what he <em class="calibre8">does</em> that Jesus accomplishes salvation on our behalf.</p>
<p class="indent">I have a pretty simple story that gets at this in a way that still shapes how I think about Jesus. I was a student pastor in a wonderful church in New Jersey, where I decided to do an adult education class on the topic “Great Doctrines of the Faith.” I figured I would teach one doctrine each of six Sundays, really punching why each of the doctrines mattered to our lives of faith. Trinity, Creation, Jesus, Spirit, Church, Hope. I was proud because I was able to round up five to ten people who came each week. (Getting adults to come to Christian education classes on a Sunday morning in New Jersey was a lot more difficult, I have since learned, than getting them to come to church in Texas, where I now live!) Each week, with my little class, I held forth with a full measure of passion <a id="page_88" class="calibre7"></a>for these teachings of the church that have been so dear to the saints through the ages.</p>
<p class="indent">On the last day of the class, as she was heading out the door, my good friend and pillar of the church stopped to thank me. Nancy said she enjoyed the class but then, leaning forward, gave me her <em class="calibre8">real</em> assessment of the material I presented. “What I think, though,” she whispered so that no one else could hear, “is that all these details about who people think Jesus is don’t make much of a difference. Jesus showed us how to love each other, and that’s all that really matters.”</p>
<p class="indent">While I am certain Nancy meant this statement to be an offering of her view and not a criticism of the Sunday school class, it hit me hard. Were all these details I was learning and just beginning to teach about the development of christology actually irrelevant? I would have said then, and certainly believe now, that knowing every detail about who Jesus Christ is, as well as every verse in the Bible about what he said and did, is worthless if we miss the main thrust of his ministry. As 1 Corinthians 13 reminds us, “If I speak in tongues of human beings and of angels but I don’t have love, I’m a clanging gong or a clashing cymbal.”<a id="rch3en40" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en40" class="calibre5">40</a></sup> My friend Nancy was correct insofar as she was remembering that Jesus <em class="calibre8">lived</em> what he taught, including that “all the Law and the Prophets . . . hang” on the two commandments “love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind,”<a id="rch3en41" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en41" class="calibre5">41</a></sup> and “love your neighbor as yourself.”<a id="rch3en42" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en42" class="calibre5">42</a></sup> To love God and one another is, of course, the most important thing of all.</p>
<p class="indent">The question is, then: Why bother with all the other stuff? Why fill up a Sunday school class? Or six classes? Or, for that matter, <em class="calibre8">a lifetime</em> with reflection on detail? After all, even John in his Gospel says, about Jesus, that if everything he said and did were recorded “the world itself wouldn’t have enough room for the scrolls that would be written.”<a id="rch3en43" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en43" class="calibre5">43</a></sup> Even the Gospel writers were selective in their depictions of Jesus. Granted, Nancy’s Gospel would have been a bit short, but wasn’t she challenging me not to overcomplicate the story, and its implications for us?</p>
<p class="indent">I went home from the class after church that Sunday and struggled with Nancy’s comment, finally realizing I was bothered not only because I had failed, somehow, in the teaching of the class but—more <a id="page_89" class="calibre7"></a>importantly—because I sensed my very thoughtful and loving friend Nancy represented a mind-set that was hazardous. Late that evening I wrote the poem with which this chapter opens. What I hope it reflects is what I finally came to, as I struggled: that the details about who Jesus Christ is do matter because they shape our understanding of what love looks like, and how we commit to living it. Historically, people have acted in many different kinds of ways in the name of Jesus Christ and in the name of Christian love. It is a real question, in fact, whether more people have been helped or harmed; whether more life has been nourished or annihilated, in the name of the Christ who taught us to love God and neighbor. Who we say Jesus Christ is makes a difference to how we understand loving actions, as we will continue exploring as this book unfolds.</p>
<p class="indent">As we head deeper into exploring the shape of our faith, it will be encouraging and challenging to recall that our forebears at Chalcedon—for all their significant faults—thought it was obvious that how we live our everyday lives, as people of faith, will be shaped by what we think about the person of Jesus Christ. I believe they would have agreed, to put it in contemporary terms, that the salvation with which we are gifted in and through Jesus Christ includes not only “fire insurance” (i.e., escape from eternal punishment) but also a way of making sense of our day-to-day lives. They clearly held that Jesus <em class="calibre8">does things for us</em> that benefit us, acting in specific ways that are saving. But they also thought it was extraordinarily important to spend a great deal of time and energy reflecting on and debating who Jesus Christ is in his person. It seems clear they thought knowing <em class="calibre8">who Jesus is</em> benefits us by helping us accurately interpret the saving value of <em class="calibre8">what it is he did</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">With that in mind we turn, now, to considering what may have been at stake for those at Chalcedon, in this debate. But more important for our purposes than trying to get back to the intentions and motivations of our fifth-century forebears (if that were even possible) is to think about their legacy for us today. We join them in struggling with how to participate in mysteries that can never be exhausted with human words, but can nevertheless be glimpsed by way of words that can face us in the right direction and show us where to focus our attention. We join them in their <a id="page_90" class="calibre7"></a>journeys of faithful, passionate inquiry, asking some of the same questions they did but from a very different time and context, fifteen centuries later. These questions include: Who is this one, Jesus, whom we call “Lord” and “Savior”? In what sense do we understand him to be “God with us,” and how would this save us, anyway? If God actually empties God’s own self<a id="rch3en44" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en44" class="calibre5">44</a></sup> in order to be human with us, how does this not represent a compromise in the very being of God? After all, if God is somehow less than who God really is in the incarnation, we can no longer say it is <em class="calibre8">God</em> who is with us in Jesus Christ. Conversely, if Jesus is, indeed, of the same stuff as the Father, does this make him in some way less human than the rest of us? Wouldn’t this mean human beings are, in some sense, diminished by Christ rather than saved by him?</p>
<p class="indent">I will turn in a moment to pursuing some of these concerns, remembering that a worthy motive (shared with the best of our fifth-century forebears) is to understand why and how the person of Jesus Christ matters to us and our salvation, as people of faith. But before moving to this, it must be acknowledged that our forebears also had motives that were <em class="calibre8">not</em> worthy. The decisions at Chalcedon were often leveraged, and continued to be leveraged, in ways that set people in opposition to each other. As Constantine used the Nicene decision to promote homogeneity that he claimed was essential for unity, so leaders in the fifth century and beyond used the Chalcedonian Statement to force a like-mindedness that was convenient for the state, but left behind those who would not comply. As will be seen, I understand the theological logic of the Chalcedonian Statement to provide much more space for diversity than is reflected in the narrow political ways it has been used oppress and control. My insistence on retrieving and imagining the possibilities of Chalcedon even given the way it has been used to foster harm, historically, is a strategy I understand to parallel a Christian’s insistence that Jesus Christ opens his arms wide to all despite the fact that his name has been used to divide, disparage, and even justify violence. Specifically, I am asking: how does who Jesus Christ <em class="calibre8">is</em> give way to the character of the love he extends to us, the love he invites us to enter into and share with one another?</p>
<h3 class="h2"><a id="page_91" class="calibre5"></a>T<small class="calibre3">HE</small> F<small class="calibre3">ULLY</small> D<small class="calibre3">IVINE</small> O<small class="calibre3">NE</small> I<small class="calibre3">S</small> F<small class="calibre3">ULLY</small> H<small class="calibre3">UMAN</small>: G<small class="calibre3">OD</small> I<small class="calibre3">S WITH</small> U<small class="calibre3">S</small><a id="rch3en45" class="calibre5"></a><sup class="calibre16"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en45" class="calibre5">45</a></sup></h3>
<p class="indent">The line from the Chalcedonian Statement that has more trickle-down influence than any other is the idea that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine. Even if church people don’t say the phrase exactly like this, they commonly recognize Jesus as in some way both divine and human. This <em class="calibre8">both divine and human identity</em> of Jesus is so commonly presumed in Christian communities that sometimes people who have been going to church all their lives might not think to pause, ponder, and wonder at it. If someone does pause to consider, and then has questions about it, they might feel as though what they are thinking is not the right kind of issue to be raised in church. They don’t discern any place for it, so they keep it to themselves. It might be that the Nones<a id="rch3en46" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en46" class="calibre5">46</a></sup> and skeptics in our communities serve all of us well by asking us questions some of us are too afraid to ask, such as: Do you really believe Jesus was God? How does that work, exactly? Why is that important? And: How, exactly, can one person be divine and human at the same time? Or: If Jesus is a human being who is divine, doesn’t that mean that all of us, in a sense, are divine?</p>
<p class="indent">To say that Jesus Christ is the fully divine one who becomes fully human is to say, in the words of that old song by Eric Bazilian,<a id="rch3en47" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en47" class="calibre5">47</a></sup> “What If God Were One of Us?” It is to say that the Word, who exists in the beginning with God as the second person of the Trinity, actually put on real flesh and lived his life as a human being, right along with us. The original Greek found in John 1:14, in fact, is the phrase ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν, which translates literally as “pitched a tent among us.” God has joined us in our regular daily lives, as fully human as we are.</p>
<p class="indent">What this means, for a start, is that God understands what it is to be finite. God understands what it is to be tired, because Jesus fell asleep on that boat and Jesus is God.<a id="rch3en48" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en48" class="calibre5">48</a></sup> God understands what it is to be sad and grieving because Jesus’s friend Lazarus died, <a id="rch3en49" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en49" class="calibre5">49</a></sup> and Jesus cried in his grief, and Jesus is God.<a id="rch3en50" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en50" class="calibre5">50</a></sup> God understands us when we don’t want to do God’s will because Jesus struggled with the will of the Father in the Garden of Gethsemane, and Jesus is God.<a id="rch3en51" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en51" class="calibre5">51</a></sup> God understands what it feels like to <a id="page_92" class="calibre7"></a>experience God’s absence because Jesus cried out on that cross: “My God! My God! Why have you forsaken me?”<a id="rch3en52" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en52" class="calibre5">52</a></sup> And Jesus is God.</p>
<p class="indent">Because Jesus is the fully divine one become fully human, there is a point of contact created between humanity and God. This does not mean we are God, but that we are joined to the very life of God by way of Jesus’s humanity because God has entered into our lives in the person of Jesus Christ. In and through Jesus Christ, we are not God, but God is human. Because Jesus Christ has entered into our existence, and lived for us, and died for us, and risen from the dead for us, our lives are “hidden with Christ in God.”<a id="rch3en53" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en53" class="calibre5">53</a></sup> In Jesus Christ, our sins have been forgiven and we are called to participation in what the Paul identifies as “the ministry of reconciliation.”<a id="rch3en54" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en54" class="calibre5">54</a></sup> We will discuss, in the section following, how full our inclusion in the work of God is, by virtue of the fact that the Jesus who is fully human is also fully divine, making a space for us—with him, by virtue of our shared humanity—as fellow heirs and co-partners. But all of this promise of us inheriting, and participating, and contributing to the kin-dom<a id="rch3en55" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en55" class="calibre5">55</a></sup> rests first on the fact that Jesus Christ is God-with-us; that the real Word really became real flesh. Without the <em class="calibre8">kenosis</em> (the self-emptying of God, in Jesus Christ) there can be no <em class="calibre8">theosis</em> (lifting up of the human, in Jesus Christ). First the one who is equal to God takes the form of a servant and becomes obedient unto death (the fully divine is fully human); then the servant is exalted until every knee bends and every tongue confesses (the fully human is fully divine).<a id="rch3en56" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en56" class="calibre5">56</a></sup> It is in relation to all of it, and the <em class="calibre8">kenosis</em> and <em class="calibre8">theosis</em> in <em class="calibre8">dialectical tension</em><a id="rch3en57" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en57" class="calibre5">57</a></sup> with one another, that salvation is worked out “with fear and trembling.”<a id="rch3en58" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en58" class="calibre5">58</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Because this idea that Jesus Christ is both fully human and fully divine is a mystery, we sometimes try to simplify it by erring on one side or the other, thinking of Jesus as <em class="calibre8">only human</em> or <em class="calibre8">only divine</em>. We might be worried, when we hear people talk about Jesus as their friend, because we fear they might be forgetting that Jesus is divine as well as human. I once had this concern when someone introduced me to what they identified as a “Jesus doll.” The idea of the doll was that kids could carry it around with them to remember that Jesus was with them. I worried that it might <a id="page_93" class="calibre7"></a>inadvertently communicate that Jesus is <em class="calibre8">only</em> human. That said, I admit I don’t have any good suggestion for how to capture the divinity of Jesus in a doll!</p>
<p class="indent">An even greater danger for us, it seems to me, is that those who “hold faith” actually emphasize the divinity of Christ at the expense of his humanity. To do this is, technically speaking, to commit heresy of <em class="calibre8">docetism</em>. Docetism is in evidence whenever we think of Jesus as God in disguise—when we think to ourselves, <em class="calibre8">Those silly disciples! When are they going to realize who Jesus Christ is, underneath all that skin!</em> If we are thinking such things, we had better double-check ourselves, reflecting on what unintended consequences come with compromising on Jesus’s full humanity.</p>
<p class="indent">If Jesus Christ is only God in disguise—a Clark Kent figure who at zip into a phone booth and change into who he really is—then God is not fully with us in him. If Jesus isn’t human all the way through to his core, we cannot make the claim that God has entered the human condition in and redeemed it.</p>
<p class="indent">Reflect, a bit, on where docetism can be seen in our lives together, today. Think about Christmastime, when we sing “Away in a Manger.”<a id="rch3en59" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en59" class="calibre5">59</a></sup> “The little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes,” we sing. Now, of course, this hymn is a lullaby, and lullabies are all about wishing a child peace, hoping for an end to tears and a good night’s rest. We offer these well-wishes, also, in our singing of “Silent Night”<a id="rch3en60" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en60" class="calibre5">60</a></sup> with the line “sleep in heavenly peace.”</p>
<p class="indent">The problem comes when the “no crying” of the carol is taken literally, as though to serve as a clue to what certain insiders already know—that Jesus isn’t just some ordinary baby. He is exceptional, of course (the problematic thinking goes), given that he is the only baby who has ever been fully divine. <em class="calibre8">Of course</em> he didn’t cry, we might think piously. As the Son of God, he is better than all that ordinary baby stuff.</p>
<p class="indent">The thing is, if we assume Jesus the baby didn’t cry because he was exceptional, or if we believe Jesus the friend didn’t actually weep at Lazarus’s tomb because he was aggrieved, or if we believe Jesus the Crucified One didn’t cry out in anguish and genuine despair on the cross, just as any human being would; if we believe that there simply could not have been real tears at any point because this would have meant Jesus’s divinity was <a id="page_94" class="calibre7"></a>compromised, then we are in real trouble. We are in real trouble because we are babies who really cry, friends who truly grieve, and people who know the anguish of believing the God who loves us has left us.</p>
<p class="indent">Another way in which we can more or less test to see if we err toward docetism is by asking ourselves (or those in our community) the question: Is Jesus human now? In my experience, if this question catches us off guard it is worth considering why. It is also worth trying to answer, reflecting on whatever it is we have to say. If we answer no, because it just seems too strange to us to think that Jesus could still be human, then when is it, exactly, that we believe Jesus ceased being in a human state? We confess that he rose, embodied, from the grave and that he then ascended, embodied, to sit on the right hand of God the Father. Did his body somehow dissolve away, as he ascended up to heaven to be reunited with his Father?</p>
<p class="indent">The problem with answering the question in the negative is that it treats the incarnation as a kind of “thirty-three-year experiment” rather than a revelation of who God is from and to eternity. Christian traditions insist on bodies, as cumbersome as they are, associating them always with human persons, and then by extension with the existence of God in the person of Jesus Christ. Thinking of Jesus as human now is, unquestionably, awkward. But then so is thinking of God entering the womb of a woman and being born, or thinking of the Son of God growing up and learning to build shelves in Joseph’s carpenter shop, or thinking of the Word without which nothing was made that was made assuming the body of a man who is crucified, dies, and is buried. The awkwardness of the body, as it is associated with Jesus’s full humanity, is not somehow overcome at the point of the resurrection (which the Christian confession inconveniently identifies as <em class="calibre8">bodily</em>). Why would we assume Jesus’s physical body is only a past reality—and not a present one—just because we cannot fathom how it could possibly be true, literally?</p>
<p class="indent">I suggest we confess our docetism and consider what it means to say that Jesus is fully human, as well as fully divine, even today. It is only when we do so that we live into the fullness of our salvation.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, such a suggestion immediately becomes tricky. This is because of something theologians like to call the <em class="calibre8">scandal of particularity</em>, or the idea <a id="page_95" class="calibre7"></a>that the humanity of God, known to us in Jesus Christ, is some things and not others. Like all humanity, it is one gender and not another, one ethnicity and not another, one height and not another, one race and not another. Jesus was male and not female, Palestinian and not Anglo, 5’10” and not 6’2”.<a id="rch3en61" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en61" class="calibre5">61</a></sup> These particularities have bothered people of faith some, even when they are applied to Jesus only in time. In other words, when we think about Jesus being male and not female for the thirty-three years he walked the face of this earth, it is easier to think of his sex merely in terms of “accidents,” in the Aristotelian sense.<a id="rch3en62" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en62" class="calibre5">62</a></sup> His maleness might be important, in these terms, to the way he interacted and accomplished his work. But it wouldn’t make a difference to his essence as a human being. Johnson uses a funny example to illustrate that our accidents matter, though not to our essence. Jesus had to be male to accomplish his mission on earth, she says, because if he had died on the cross as a female no one would have noticed.<a id="rch3en63" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en63" class="calibre5">63</a></sup> That’s because women have, historically, always been known for and expected to give up their lives for others!</p>
<p class="indent">The benefit of interpreting particularities as accidents, and not essence, is fairly clear, from a perspective concerned with understanding the person of Jesus Christ in ways attuned “with us and our salvation.” We can see it immediately and strikingly if we rehearse a point made by Gregory of Nazianzus, way back in the fourth century. To give you just a touch of context: following Nicea (325), a theologian named Apollinaris tried to interpret the <em class="calibre8">homoousion</em> in a way that came to be seen, by the church, as confusing the two natures of Christ.<a id="rch3en64" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en64" class="calibre5">64</a></sup> He argued, in short, that the divine Logos <em class="calibre8">replaced</em> the mind of Christ in the historical person of Jesus Christ in such a way that the humanity of Christ was, functionally speaking, taken over by the divinity. Apollinaris’s teaching was very popular, but was eventually condemned for being docetic (compromising on Jesus Christ’s humanity).<a id="rch3en65" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en65" class="calibre5">65</a></sup> Gregory of Nazianzus challenged head-on, in a single sentence, the problem with Apollinaris’s view: “What has not been assumed cannot be restored; it is what is united with God that is saved,” he said.<a id="rch3en66" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en66" class="calibre5">66</a></sup> This statement, often expressed as “that which has not been assumed has not been redeemed,” is one of the most well-known and frequently invoked insights in Christian theological history. Almost everyone—even <a id="page_96" class="calibre7"></a>those on opposing sides of ecclesial debates—invokes it as being true. And what statement could possibly link, more elegantly, Jesus’s person to our redemption, the doctrine of incarnation to the doctrine of salvation?<a id="rch3en67" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en67" class="calibre5">67</a></sup> The assumption of our flesh by the Word who is God accomplishes our salvation!</p>
<p class="indent">With this point of Gregory’s in place, now, it becomes pretty clear that we must insist Christ took on the humanity of all in taking on the humanity of one particular person. We are in dangerous water, for example, if we say he assumed male humanity and not female humanity, because this would mean (according to Gregory’s insight), that women are not by him redeemed. To put it another way, drawing from a popular book series: if men are from Mars and women are from Venus, women are in big trouble!<a id="rch3en68" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en68" class="calibre5">68</a></sup> Believing that women are redeemed in Christ, just as men are, it must be that there are not two kinds of humanity, but one: the humanity Jesus assumed is the humanity of women just as much as it is the humanity of men, even though the Word was made incarnate in a human being who was “accidentally”<a id="rch3en69" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en69" class="calibre5">69</a></sup> male (and Palestinian, and Jewish, and a certain, singular height). There is only one essential humanity, and the Word has entered into it just as any of us do, with certain particularities.<a id="rch3en70" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en70" class="calibre5">70</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Once we start talking about the humanity of God being a revelation of who God is, was, and always will be, however, it becomes more difficult to keep in mind that the particular particularities of Jesus’s embodied existence are not essential to his humanity. To be human is to have particularities, but to be human is not dependent on having certain particularities over others. Jesus enters into all humanity by entering into the limitations of what it means to be a particular embodied human being.</p>
<p class="indent">Shifts in our understanding about what constitutes gender will also change the way we think about Jesus’s particularity as a male human being. Even though the so-called nature versus nurture debates continues, as we try to understand the relationship between the bodies people appear to be born with and how they understand their own gender and sexuality, few would deny that how we are socialized, as gendered human beings, plays a significant role in how we understand ourselves as male and as female. In twenty-first-century American culture, where Bruce Jenner is now Caitlyn <a id="page_97" class="calibre7"></a>Jenner and most major airports have added gender neutral restrooms, our culture no longer thinks of gender as something absolute. Even if we are uncomfortable with the idea of gender fluidity, we recognize that someone who currently self-identifies as female will not necessarily always continue to do so. Even if someone is one gender and not another, then, the possibility of change might make us less likely to think about male humanity and female humanity as though these are fundamentally different things.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, if we are to say that the humanity of Jesus Christ is in some real sense an eternal reality, it does not work to say that <em class="calibre8">everything</em> about him, as a human being, should be thought about as accidents. We need to claim the truth that the Word enters into a <em class="calibre8">particular</em> human flesh, with all its particularities—and in so doing somehow enters into <em class="calibre8">all</em> flesh.<a id="rch3en71" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en71" class="calibre5">71</a></sup> But what does it mean to be enfleshed, to be fully human? What would eternal humanity <em class="calibre8">look like</em>, exactly?</p>
<p class="indent">As we mentioned above, the biblical stories about Jesus are unrelenting in their assertion that who Jesus is now must in some way include a body. Speaking in terms of accidents may begin to address some of the problems precipitated by this (as we have discussed), but it still remains to say what does constitute our shared humanity. If the humanity shared by all human beings is not male, Jewish, and Palestinian, then what constitutes shared humanity, exactly? And why does getting at this matter to our lives of faith?</p>
<p class="indent">Calvin insists that one of the things shared by all human beings, including the resurrected Jesus who is eternally fully human as well as fully divine, is physical location. While Calvin holds that the divine Word is ubiquitous (everywhere present), he also believes that it is in one special location and not another at any given time, as it is incarnate in the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth. Calvin thinks that the eternal humanity of Jesus Christ, which the Creed says is “sitting at the right hand of God the Father Almighty”<a id="rch3en72" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en72" class="calibre5">72</a></sup> is critically important to understanding the shape of our salvation. It is not so much, he thinks, that the point of the Creed is that Jesus is seated in one place and can never move, but that the Jesus who is everywhere present is at the same time now in one place, and not another.<a id="rch3en73" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en73" class="calibre5">73</a></sup> So central to the identity of Jesus Christ did Calvin think this seeming paradox is that he interpreted biblical texts and the meaning of <a id="page_98" class="calibre7"></a>the sacraments in relation to it. I will explain why this is the case, but first allow me to demonstrate Calvin’s tenacity on this issue.</p>
<p class="indent">In interpreting the post-resurrection appearance of Jesus to the disciples, as the story is told in John 20, Calvin is clearly looking through a Chalcedonian lens. He is asking himself the question: How is this resurrected body of Jesus still a fully human body, if Jesus is now in a “glorified”<a id="rch3en74" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en74" class="calibre5">74</a></sup> state? Probably he has running through his mind and heart the kinds of things we think about when we try to put all the post-resurrection stories about Jesus together into a coherent understanding: Jesus says “don’t touch me!” as if he is a Spirit, but then he invites Thomas to touch his hands and his sides so that he might believe;<a id="rch3en75" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en75" class="calibre5">75</a></sup> Jesus is unrecognizable to the disciples, but then is recognized;<a id="rch3en76" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en76" class="calibre5">76</a></sup> Jesus is immortal but still able to eat. But when Calvin reads John 20:26,<a id="rch3en77" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en77" class="calibre5">77</a></sup> where the text says that Jesus appeared “in the midst”<a id="rch3en78" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en78" class="calibre5">78</a></sup> of the disciples gathered together in the Upper Room, Calvin draws a hard line. Because he believes that the ongoing humanity of Jesus Christ must mean something <em class="calibre8">concrete</em>, and because he believes what it means is that Jesus’s resurrected body is not ubiquitous but physically located, he insists Jesus must have walked physically through a door. His explanation for John’s phrasing is that the disciples were too full of grief to notice that he had come in, or been let in by someone who unlocked the door and opened it for him.</p>
<p class="indent">I can almost hear my friend Nancy sighing, reminding me that at this point maybe Calvin and I are getting too hung up on the details. But let me push on just a little bit more, because I think what Nancy missed, what I failed to convey to her, and what we all often overlook, in our day—is thinking through <em class="calibre8">why</em> Calvin would be so obsessed with this kind of detail. What was at stake for him?</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever it was, it was at stake for him as he wrote scores and scores of pages about why what happens in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper is <em class="calibre8">not</em> that the bread and the wine are <em class="calibre8">transubstantiated</em> into the body and blood of Jesus Christ. In some sense, his argument against the Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century is very simple: if Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God the Father, his flesh and blood cannot be physically located in the elements of the sacrament. True, he thought that <a id="page_99" class="calibre7"></a>Christ’s body and blood are “really present . . . by the ‘bond of participation’ that is the Holy Spirit.”<a id="rch3en79" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en79" class="calibre5">79</a></sup> But this, he thought, was a different thing than saying they are “locally” present. “In his flesh he be in heaven, which he has chosen as the abode of his human nature,”<a id="rch3en80" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en80" class="calibre5">80</a></sup> Calvin insisted, speaking against the idea that Christ’s body and blood could somehow be in every piece of bread and every drop of wine consumed in the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, though, why the big deal? We might appreciate the fact that Calvin took Chalcedon seriously enough to play out what the full humanity of Jesus Christ looks like, but was doing so really the best use of his time? What was at stake for him? How were these arguments, which we see in his interpretation of certain biblical passages and in his understanding of the sacraments, indicative of how he understood our salvation, extended by Christ?</p>
<h3 class="h2">W<small class="calibre3">HY THE</small> “F<small class="calibre3">ULL</small> H<small class="calibre3">UMANITY</small>” C<small class="calibre3">ONTINUES TO</small> M<small class="calibre3">ATTER</small></h3>
<p class="indent">For Calvin what was at stake in all this was our knowing that God knows us. Following the line of reasoning that he began: If Jesus, post-resurrection, were not in some way identifiably human, we would not be able to say that, in and through him, we are in actual relationship to <em class="calibre8">God</em>. We would be able to say a lot, to be sure. We could say, for example, that God did something wonderful for us, in entering into existence in the person of Jesus Christ for that thirty-three-year time span. We could say we learned a great deal, through that event, about what God is like. We could say that Jesus Christ tells things that are true <em class="calibre8">about</em> God. But we couldn’t say that we know God directly, in God’s very own self, in the person of Jesus Christ who was, is, and always will be <em class="calibre8">fully human with us</em>. If Jesus’s humanity were only a temporary condition, we would know God as the fully divine one who went out of God’s way for us to do something extra special. To live with us so we would know God cares and understands. To die by our hand so that we would know we have been forgiven, even of <a id="page_100" class="calibre7"></a>the worst of sins. To rise for us so that we know the pains of this world are not, finally, the things that will endure.</p>
<p class="indent">We would know all these things, and we could be awe-stricken and grateful. We could bow, reverently, in the context of Christian worship, thanking God for all God has done for us. But we would miss out on the fullness of our salvation, because we would not know God directly in and through the fully human one. What we would know of God would only be whatever we could glean through the mediation of this one who took on our creaturely existence for a time in order to teach us, to show us, to demonstrate to us God’s love. The humanity, in the case of a Jesus who is not human now, would be a pedagogical tool that would help us know about the God we are incapable of knowing directly.</p>
<p class="indent">Such an understanding of Jesus Christ’s humanity would be quite logical, especially since it syncs with Christian convictions about the magnitude, mystery, and unknowability of God.<a id="rch3en81" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en81" class="calibre5">81</a></sup> But it is not, finally, adequate to the task of articulating what, at the Council of Chalcedon, our forebears in the faith saw as the heart of the mystery: that is, that our salvation rests, somehow, in the existence of this one, Jesus Christ, whose very constitution, from the vantage point of human understanding, appears to be a contradiction. The very same one who is born from the Father before the ages in relation to his divinity is, in relation to his humanity, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. If we were to say that the Word “covered himself in flesh” or “disguised himself in flesh” or “became human temporarily in order to pay us a visit and teach us something about God,” we would be compromising on the mystery in order to better understand it. The mystery is, precisely, that this one who is wholly divine is also wholly human, and that these two natures do not seem readily or logically to hold together. Instead of trying to understand how they do fit, we would do well, as people of faith, to explore the “so what?” of their coexistence. When it comes to the mystery of Jesus Christ being one person in two natures, we can’t understand it, but we can know what it is about.<a id="rch3en82" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en82" class="calibre5">82</a></sup> As Chalcedon bears witness, what it is about has something to do with us and our salvation. We are saved because in and through Jesus Christ—the one who is eternally fully human as well as fully divine—we <a id="page_101" class="calibre7"></a>know not only that God visited with us, at one point, but that God <em class="calibre8">is</em> with us—right now. We know not only that God has done and will do great things for us, because God has done them in Jesus Christ, but also that God <em class="calibre8">is</em> for us in God’s very self. In Jesus who was and is fully human, we are privy to the humanity of God. In knowing Jesus who is fully human as well as fully divine, we know not only what God has done for us; we know and are in relationship to this God. In Jesus, the one who is fully human as well as fully divine, we know the God who is unknowable. And even as we know God truly by way of Jesus Christ’s full humanity, we are drawn more deeply into the knowledge of God’s unknowability. We stand in awe of the God who will not be limited to being unlimited, who will not be limited to being only divine, but has brought the limits of creaturely existence into God’s very own life and says, with Mary: How can this be? We stand in awe of the God who does not do things for us in order to instruct us, but because God loves us. We stand in awe because it would be enough to believe our powerful God benevolently went out of God’s way to instruct us and to offer us gifts. Instead, what the eternal humanity of God in the person of Jesus Christ conveys to us is that it is not so much that the Word became flesh in order to instruct us, but that the Word became flesh because God so loves us.</p>
<p class="indent">This changes everything, when it comes to us and our salvation. Instead of being servants who feel compelled to respond to the God who treats us so well, we are friends who are called by the One who loves us to “remain” in him and hold fast to his words.<a id="rch3en83" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en83" class="calibre5">83</a></sup> Instead of being those who wait patiently at the edges of the Garden for our fully-divine-but-disguised-as-a-human Lord to confer with the Father God, we are shaken awake and asked to join hearts, lives, and destinies with this one who desires the companionship and partnership of fellow human beings.<a id="rch3en84" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en84" class="calibre5">84</a></sup> Instead of being those who can be content, simply, to let go and let God, we are those who are charged to “carry out [our] own salvation with fear and trembling,” knowing “God is the one who enables [us] both to want and to actually live out God’s good purposes.”<a id="rch3en85" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en85" class="calibre5">85</a></sup> Because the fully divine one is fully human for all of eternity, it is both the case that God is with us no matter what and that we are included, as participants, in the life and work of God.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the worthy concerns about the Chalcedonian Statement, raised in various ways by those committed to the work of social justice, is that thinking about Jesus as fully human as well as fully divine inevitably backfires, disempowering or excusing human agents by representing Jesus, ultimately, as the God who is able to do it all—including being the human being we are not able to be. The concern is that, in the final analysis, to speak of Jesus as fully human and fully divine will lead, ultimately, to a depiction of Jesus in which the divinity more or less trumps the humanity. The humanity is taken into the divine; there is, now, nothing that God does not have covered; human beings who are marginalized are encouraged not to act but to wait on God to do the work; human beings who are oppressors are excused from acting by way of appealing to the God who understands and who “works all things together for good”<a id="rch3en87" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en87" class="calibre5">87</a></sup> in the end.<a id="rch3en88" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en88" class="calibre5">88</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In my view, these important critiques have validity and must be taken into account in the development of any christology. I understand them to apply to what I would say is an abuse of the Chalcedonian Statement rather than to its conceptual content. Chalcedon has been distorted whenever we speak elegantly about God’s radical presence with us, in the person of Jesus Christ, without testifying with equal fervor to the truth that, because <em class="calibre8">God</em> is with us (the fully divine one is fully human), <em class="calibre8">we</em> are with God (the fully human one is fully divine). Consideration of this Chalcedonian idea—that we as human beings are in some sense through Christ integrated into the life and work of God—has consistently been neglected by those who have little interest in inviting people to think of themselves as the “hands and feet” of God.<a id="rch3en89" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en89" class="calibre5">89</a></sup> The idea of the humanity of God, when understood to carry all of we humans into God’s life-giving work of this world, is exhilarating for those who value egalitarianism and inclusion, but frightening for those who are more comfortable with hierarchical ways of thinking about who God’s agents are in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider Mary, again: Into her very womb God empties Godself in the baby Jesus Christ. She is lifted up, by way of this, to sing and prophesy <a id="page_103" class="calibre7"></a>about how God is acting to reverse the order of life as we know it: “[God] has filled the hungry with good things,” she says, “and sent the rich away empty-handed.”<a id="rch3en90" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en90" class="calibre5">90</a></sup> This is clearly not what those who have worldly power want people like Mary to be saying. This may be one reason why, then, there has been a problematic tendency for ecclesial structures, when talking about Chalcedon, to emphasize that Jesus is the fully divine one who empties himself to be with us, but to neglect the idea that, in and through Jesus Christ, humanity is with God, participating in the divine life.</p>
<p class="indent">It might help to understand what is at stake here by coming at it another way. Chalcedon argues that, when Jesus couldn’t heal when the people didn’t have enough faith, when he was corrected by the Canaanite woman, when he cried at Lazarus’s tomb, and when he called out with agony on the cross,<a id="rch3en91" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en91" class="calibre5">91</a></sup> he did all of these things every bit as much as one who is divine as one who is human. While these examples might seem jarring to those who understand God to be unchanging and self-sufficient, I am naming them in an attempt to take the Chalcedonian insight seriously. To continue in this vein: according to Chalcedon, the one who fed the five thousand with lots of leftovers, the one who walked on the water and spoke so meaningfully and eloquently, the one who forgave sins and rose from the dead<a id="rch3en92" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en92" class="calibre5">92</a></sup>—this one did all of these things as a fully human, human being as much as he did them as one who is divine. What does this say about our humanity, insofar as it is joined to the humanity of Jesus Christ? This Word that touched all flesh by becoming flesh shows us what flesh is capable of, in and through our participation in him. This idea, it seems, is even more unnerving to the status quo than the idea that (for example) Jesus, the divine one, weeps. But the potential, here, to “liberate the oppressed”<a id="rch3en93" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en93" class="calibre5">93</a></sup> must be revisited and claimed.</p>

<p class="indent">Reflecting on the meaning and significance of the Chalcedonian Statement from various angles, Barth considers not only what we learn <a id="page_104" class="calibre7"></a>from recognizing the fully divine one as fully human, but also what we learn from acknowledging the fully human one as fully divine. If the full humanity of the divine Jesus leads us to think of <em class="calibre8">kenosis</em>, as it is described in Philippians 2:3-7a, the full divinity of the human one leads us to consider the implications for us and our salvation of <em class="calibre8">theosis</em>, as it is described in Philippians 2:7b-8. The fully divine one empties himself and is (also) fully human, becoming obedient even unto death on the cross. The fully human one is exalted by the Father and is (also) fully divine, lifted up from that pivotal moment on the cross to the glorious, inclusive reality in which no one is left behind—every knee bends, every tongue confesses, that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>
<p class="indent">The “so what?” of Chalcedon, when considered from the vantage point of <em class="calibre8">theosis</em> (exaltation), is just as significant for understanding who Jesus is, and how he reconciles us to God, as is <em class="calibre8">kenosis</em>. If the confession that the fully divine one is fully human reminds us that <em class="calibre8">God</em> is ever <em class="calibre8">with and for us</em>, the confession that the fully human one is fully divine reminds us that <em class="calibre8">we</em>, therefore, <em class="calibre8">are</em>—in and through Jesus Christ—<em class="calibre8">with and for God</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">What this means is that we who are mere creatures, we who in and of ourselves often feel it is an amazing accomplishment just to have made it through another day—we are actually included, and even have the status of being “partners” with God. In and through Jesus Christ, the one who has entered fully into existence with us, we are lifted up and included in the life and work and God.<a id="rch3en94" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en94" class="calibre5">94</a></sup> This is, as we will discuss later, the movement of baptism—Jesus Christ became sin, died, was buried, rose, and is exalted. We join him in dying to self and are lifted up to become new creatures—heirs together with him and partners with him in the ministry of reconciliation!</p>
<p class="indent">Now, this language of partnership needs to be handled carefully. After all, who are <em class="calibre8">we</em> to think of ourselves as <em class="calibre8">partners</em> with God? Barth noted that talking about the implications of the confession that the fully human one is fully divine could get us into trouble—that we might be accused of heresy, of compromising on the sovereignty of God, of thinking of ourselves as in some way divine. But the implication of remembering that the fully human one is fully divine is not at all that we, as human beings, <a id="page_105" class="calibre7"></a>are in some way divine. In fact, the implication is closer to the opposite of this. The fact that God has taken humanity into God’s own life in the person of Jesus Christ, as borne witness to by Chalcedon, frees us to think of ourselves as partnering with God as the fully human, human beings we are. We do not have first to become better, stronger, and faster than before. We do not have to engage in spiritual practices that make us more worthy. We do not have to focus on being less human, less creaturely, less limited. We are worthy as we are, as the beautiful creatures God made us, as creatures joined in creatureliness by God in Jesus, as creatures included in the operations of God’s household also by way of the Jesus who enters into our lives with us and then takes us along, with him, into the ongoing creation of life that is new.</p>
<p class="indent">To claim Jesus Christ is both fully human and fully divine means, then, that our relationship to God is not founded in a mere transaction—with God doing things for us and us, in gratitude, then trying our best to respond by doing things for God. Because God in the person of Jesus Christ doesn’t simply do things for us but <em class="calibre8">is</em> for us, we can be for God and one another. Our relationship to God and to others, when we know what the person of Jesus Christ is all about, looks nothing like a transaction or a contract (in which we get the better end of the deal, but we do what we can and are grateful). On the contrary, our relationship to God and one another, when we are paying attention to the person of Jesus Christ as fully human and fully divine, looks a lot like the relationship of people who love each other dearly. The doing for is there, but it is an extension of the being for. The <em class="calibre8">being with</em> is the reality, but it is no burden whatsoever—it is a manifestation of the desire to <em class="calibre8">be with</em> that is had by a Lover for the Beloved. It is core, and unconditional, and tenacious, and never satiated. It is “love so amazing, so divine” that it “demands our life, our souls, our all.”<a id="rch3en95" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en95" class="calibre5">95</a></sup> It is the love in which we abide, the love we learn by way of the humanity of God, the love that, as John says, actually is God.<a id="rch3en96" class="calibre7"></a><sup class="calibre12"><a href="notes.xhtml#ch3en96" class="calibre5">96</a></sup> In the next chapter we will continue thinking about the love of God as it is expressed not only in God’s acts on our behalf, but in God’s own self-relation as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
