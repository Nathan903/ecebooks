<p class="noind" id="pAuQB">In the doctrine of the divine perfections, the theologian attempts to answer the question “What is God like?” by carefully elaborating the revealed character of God through the wise use of sanctified reason. God’s perfections are neither diverse realities possessed by God nor conceptual labels we place upon him, but distinct characteristics or qualities uniquely naming him. These perfections are proper descriptions of God’s simple, triune being, which we know to provide a true and coherent account of the identity of the incomprehensible One on the basis of faith in his trustworthy self-disclosure in scriptural word and deed.</p>
<p id="pAORb8">While we seek to describe God according to the ways he has given himself to be known, we must always remember that even our fitting descriptions aren’t prescriptions that determine the identity of the self-existent One who remains free even in giving himself. The divine perfections are never attributions in that sense, defining God’s being on the basis of human reasoning and therefore speaking of no God at all. Yet this freedom of God is no barrier to theological reason. Even in his aseity, the true God—given in Christ through the Spirit and the Word—is inexpressibly more faithful and consistent and <i>even more present and palpable</i> <span id="z179-6">than whatever shadows of him and his ways we may conjure from our own heads and hearts.</span></p>
<p id="pz179-7">In this essay, we take the position that Christian theological reasoning about the divine perfections should be formed entirely by the God who bears these perfections in himself and therefore in his free self-disclosure. We believe a fruitful way of thus disciplining our reasoning is to approach the doctrine of God’s perfections in light of two sets of coordinate doctrines: aseity paired with simplicity and Trinity with Christology. Aseity and simplicity <i>form</i> our reasoning about God’s perfections, in the sense of bracketing the scope and shape of our doctrinal claims, while Trinity and Christology <i>inform</i> our reasoning, in the sense of grounding the veracity of those claims, pervasively characterizing their content, and governing their interrelations. As such, we suggest that this approach is useful for speaking not only of God’s character but also of his ways, and thus it proves to be fruitful for the whole scope of the dogmatic task.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_1" id="ttf_14_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="pz179-8">A<span class="smallcaps" id="AyjN">SEITY AND</span> S<span class="smallcaps" id="AK6y">IMPLICITY</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz179-9">To confess God’s aseity is to say that he inherently and underivatively possesses the ground and continuance of his being in the inexhaustible riches of the triune life. To confess God’s simplicity is to say that he is self-consistent—that every particular aspect or characteristic of the divine nature is entirely true of the triune life. Thus, aseity and simplicity cooperate to continually refocus our reasoning on the living God from whom and to whom are all things, not only as the ultimate bearer of all his perfections but as the unique subject of each and all. This interplay between aseity and simplicity carries the special dogmatic burden of calling us to confess that the Lord, our God, who is a fountain of life (Ps 36:9) and who is faithful to do all he has promised (1 Thess 5:24), is one (Deut 6:4).</p>
<p id="pz179-10">It’s fitting to begin our theological reasoning about God’s perfections with his aseity because everything we’re saying is a claim about the One who is <i>sui generis</i>, uniquely and incomparably this God without precedent or peer. We can think of aseity as our <i>terminus a quo</i>. It should always be our “from where?” in reasoning about the divine perfections, testifying to God’s own “from where,” his existence <i>a se</i>. In this sense, all the divine <span id="z180-6">perfections are implicated by or present in God’s aseity—not because of logical deduction, but because even when we begin to speak of the “from where?” of his character, he is already fully “there.” God is wholly who he is apart from and before our beginning to speak of him.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_2" id="ttf_14_2">2</a></sup> God’s aseity calls us to receive what we’ve been given, placing an emphasis on the sheer <i>givenness</i> of God’s life in himself and toward us. Our theology is a response to this free and gracious self-giving; beginning with aseity isn’t only fitting to the uniqueness of God, therefore, but to the posture of faith.</span></p>
<p id="pz180-7">Likewise, it’s fitting to end our theological reasoning with simplicity because everything we will have claimed for the uniquely self-existent God applies <i>entirely</i> to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and should stand in utter consistency with whatever else is true of each person and all together as God. We are true to God when in this way we confess God to be true to himself. Simplicity is the <i>terminus ad quem</i> of our theologizing in the sense that it’s always our “unto what?” in reasoning about the divine perfections, interrogating every conclusion of our theological reasoning in order to render it fit to approach the living God.</p>
<p id="pz180-8">In this way, beginning with aseity is especially appropriate to exercising the gift of faith, and ending with simplicity is fitting to bearing the gracious fruits of faithfulness.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_3" id="ttf_14_3">3</a></sup> We cannot speak in faith without at the same time repenting of the idols of the nations and of our hearts: so alluring one minute and so mundane the next—so unlike God! Likewise, we cannot reason faithfully without walking in the holiness the Spirit supplies. Every assumption, every deduction, every implication stands or falls not on analysis or common sense but ultimately on the sustaining grace of God, a grace that challenges and disciplines our reasoning in the process of setting it apart as holy. So by faith we confess the only true God who is incomprehensible yet gives himself to be known, and through faithfulness we maintain this confession’s focus on God himself as its mysterious and merciful coherency.</p>
<h2 id="pz181-6">T<span class="smallcaps" id="AKrL">RINITY AND</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="AZvXI">HRISTOLOGY</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz181-7">So aseity is the “from where?” It asserts God’s exclusivity as uniquely God alone. And simplicity is the “unto what?” It asserts God’s consistency as wholly and always exactly who he is in his exclusivity as Lord. But on their own, apart from the actual content of the self-disclosure of the Father in the Son by the Spirit, these bookends and everything between them are as prone to be like “trying to find a black cat in the dark” as any other claim about the characteristics of a God with whom we really have nothing to do. <i>Qualis sit Deus</i> again becomes just another curious topic for philosophers and theologians to debate—always searching but never coming to a knowledge of the truth (2 Tim 3:7). In fact, claiming aseity and simplicity for such an unknown God heightens the problem of our ignorance in the face of his utter incomprehensibility.</p>
<p id="pz181-8">This is why the other set of coordinate doctrinal claims—Trinity and Christology—is critical. The triune God is the <i>principium essendi</i> of the divine perfections, the reality to which—to whom—these descriptions apply.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_4" id="ttf_14_4">4</a></sup> The God who reveals his exclusive name as YHWH emphatically refuses to share that name and its divine glory with any other (Isa 42:8). Yet that name above every name is borne no less gloriously by Jesus (Phil 2:9–10), and together with Jesus, Paul confesses the Spirit to be <i>kyrios</i>, the Lord (2 Cor 3:17). The one name into which we’re baptized—the one God in which we glory, the God known in all his perfections—that name belongs to the Father, Son, and Spirit (Matt 28:19).</p>
<p id="pz181-9">Likewise, Jesus Christ is the <i>principium cognoscendi</i> of the revealed knowledge of the perfections, as the one in whom all true revelation of and speech about God cohere, the Icomprehensible incarnate, the <i>principium essendi</i> who has made his dwelling among us. Traditionally, Protestants have identified Scripture as the principle of our theological knowledge, and we believe this is also true: Jesus possesses in himself both the self-knowledge of God and the fullness of all creaturely knowledge of God, and he reveals that knowledge unto salvation by his Spirit through the scriptural word of the prophets and apostles.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_5" id="ttf_14_5">5</a></sup> So both the beginning and the end of theological reasoning—which <span id="z182-6">is just to say, scriptural reasoning—find their moorings in Jesus. Surely he is the Alpha and Omega of all things, theology not least of all! Jesus is the God who is known and the one who makes God known. The author and perfecter of our faith is the one who first knows and loves his Father in perfect faith and faithfulness, who then conforms us to his own image by giving us his Spirit and word, so that what belongs to Jesus belongs to us in him.</span></p> 
<h2 id="pz182-7">G<span class="smallcaps" id="AC7U">OD</span>’<span class="smallcaps" id="AoeY">S</span> (W<span class="smallcaps" id="AuCr7">RATHFUL</span>) L<span class="smallcaps" id="AVU5">OVE</span>: A T<span class="smallcaps" id="Arpp">EST</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="Aaf0">ASE</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz182-8">How does this approach look when considering a particular divine perfection? God’s love offers a promising example.</p>
<p id="pz182-9">God’s love flows forth from his triune life, which he freely shares with his creatures, drawing them into the loving fellowship he forever enjoys in himself. Because of his love’s inexhaustible source within himself, God can give from his fullness without reserve. In this love, God is not in need of love from us; instead, he gives his creatures life and breath and everything (Acts 17:25), and lovingly draws us into fellowship with himself without losing what he had or gaining what he lacked.</p>
<p id="pz182-10">God loves his creatures from this freedom. Although the love he extends to his creatures is both contingent and free, it bears the same character and depth as the love he has in himself because in his simplicity he is wholly who he is in all his actions. Love characterizes God in his consistency and unity, thus it completely describes his manifold perfections. His love is good and holy and just; his goodness, holiness, and justice are loving.</p>
<p id="pz182-11">Everything God is, he is as the loving God in the communion of Father, Son, and Spirit. In the created economy, we don’t receive a reduced expression—or even a deeply rich manifestation—of God’s love for sinners in Christ. In Jesus we experience God’s love for sinners with his own two hands. We encounter the God who is love made manifest, the Son expressing the love of his Father in the love of their Spirit, a love that is whole and complete in each and all together. That perfect love is freely shared with us (John 17:23). Since God is indivisible, there’s no aspect of him which is against us in the gospel, no moment when our Father regrets adopting us, or no extenuating circumstances where the indwelling Spirit might reconsider his guarantee of our inheritance. The God who is <i>entirely</i> for us in Christ is <i>always</i> for us in Christ.</p>
<p id="pz183-6">Because God is wholly love, we must affirm that God is also loving toward those who don’t embrace his forgiving, transforming, covenant-keeping love in Christ. With the Bible, we need to be careful about <i>whom</i> and <i>how</i> we say God loves. God is only our Father in the fullest sense if we have become his sons and daughters in his only begotten Son. Nonetheless, the God <i>who is</i> love is always himself. God is the same God to those in whom his love finds fruition as he is to those who spurn him (cf. Acts 17:26–27).</p>
<p id="pz183-7">God’s love is a dangerous thing; sometimes it embraces, and sometimes it exposes. Mark tells us Jesus “loved” the rich young ruler when he uncovered his greed and sent him away sorrowful (Mark 10:21); Jesus says anyone who doesn’t hate their own most cherished family members compared to their love for him cannot follow him (Luke 14:26). God loves us whether his loving pursuit induces us to love him back, or whether we twist it into one more motive for rejecting or disdaining him.</p>
<p id="pz183-8">It’s here that we start to see something of the relation between divine love and wrath. God’s wrath doesn’t exist apart from his love, but flows from it as a mode of his love toward sin and rebellion. It is love shown forth in the context of active offense. God doesn’t need to be wrathful in order to be who he is, yet this conduct is entirely befitting a God who is utterly good, just, and holy in his freedom to display his mercy and his wrath (Rom 9:22). Yet even as God displays his wrath, he isn’t ill tempered or out of control—his is a wrathful love. God will not let sinners forever rule themselves and ruin others because that would be the unloving thing to do. As Elie Wiesel famously said, “the opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_6" id="ttf_14_6">6</a></sup> Indeed, God who is perfect in goodness, holiness, and justice as well as love <i>therefore</i> exercises wrath against sin, evil, hatred, and injustice because he is always exactly who he is in that context too.</p>
<p id="pz183-9">So we see that, as a mode of his love, God’s wrath is <i>a se</i>, uniquely characterized by his own nature; it’s simple, completely consistent with his justice, holiness, goodness, and so on. God’s wrath is Trinitarian—it’s no more or less an expression of the Father’s love as wrath in the face of sin than it is an expression of the Son’s wrath as judgment (Rev 19:15) and an expression of the world’s conviction by the Spirit according to that judgment (John 16:11). And finally, wrath is christological, to be understood concretely according to God’s self-revelation in Christ.</p>
<p id="pz183-10">In the cross of the incarnate God, we see the most powerful manifestation <span id="z184-6">possible of the Trinity’s wrathful love and its exposure and embrace of sinners. Did God <i>hate</i> the world by revealing the deepest darkness of the human heart that day? Was it God’s <i>spite</i> that put our self-centeredness on display at Golgotha before sun, moon, and stars, which all turned in shame at the sight? Of course not, certainly not in the way we think of it. Jesus showed us—and let us show ourselves—who we really are as sinners that day. Was that love? Yes—thunderous and speechless, reckless and wise, burning with all the wrathful passion of the living God yet pitiful in its apparent futility to thwart a fickle mob and a few jaded soldiers. “This is love, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins” (1 John 4:10 NASB).</span></p>

<p class="noind" id="AFzL">We believe our advocacy of an account of the perfections along these lines carries a deeply classical motive, even as it teases out the theological well-roundedness sometimes only implicit in classical expositions. We’re aware, certainly, that not all attempts at doing so are equally successful at remaining classical while contributing something new.</p>
<p id="pz184-8">Theology after Barth, on the one hand, has tended to employ a form of Christocentrism to avoid problems that can, and sometimes have, arisen in the most reified forms of classical theology. Some theologians have shown a tendency to conceive of the divine perfections (such as love) apart from their concrete manifestations in the gospel economy. For example, they might conceptualize the divine love between two perfect agents in maximal mutual delight apart from any explicit reference to the pattern of love between Christ and his Father revealed in Scripture. To solve this problem, many have conceived of the dogmatic task through Christ as both the <i>principium cognoscendi</i> of theology as well as its direct <i>principium essendi</i>. Accordingly, to be Chalcedonian in this sense is to confess the shape of theology to be Christomorphic because the being of God is.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_7" id="ttf_14_7">7</a></sup> Grounding the whole Christ, God and man, in the divine life in this way fully identifies theology and economy—closing the classical analogical interval—in order to guard against theological abstraction.</p>
<p id="pz184-9">This instinct of not eliding Jesus at any point in our theological reasoning <span id="z185-6">is a good one. However, a potential conflation of theological reasoning (which is Christomorphic) with theology’s object (which is now conceived of as Christomorphic) threatens here. And if Trinity and Christology collapse into a single point, we not only lose the real distinctions and interplay between them, but we also lose much of what must be said between aseity and simplicity. Instead, by treating Trinity and Christology as an irreducible pairing of complementary doctrinal claims we can avoid this pinch. We can certainly take up the central constructive insight of Barth—that in Christ the fullness of the one true God really does dwell—and we can add to it the crucial proviso, in <i>bodily form</i> (Col 2:9). It is the presence of both these moments that most faithfully trace the Chalcedonian pattern: without confusion, exchange, separation, or division.</span></p> 
<h2 id="pz185-7">N<span class="smallcaps" id="As0O">EGLECTING</span> T<span class="smallcaps" id="Adb-cb">RINITY AND</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="A8O0">HRISTOLOGY</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz185-8">On the other hand, some theologians have pushed back on the modern desire for a more Christomorphic doctrine of God, and we think rightly so in view of the solid Christian consensus that God’s free economic activity in no way determines his immanent identity. This more classical approach is really comfortable lingering on aseity and simplicity. But as with anything else, it can be taken too far—the nature of God isn’t intrinsically Christomorphic, but the nature of theology is.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_14_8" id="ttf_14_8">8</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz185-9">Jesus is the one in whom all our dogmatic claims and conclusions about God, the world, and their relations hold together. Jesus isn’t all of God, but he is all that God is, and we get all of God in him. Jesus isn’t the Father, but he is all the Father is and the only one who reveals him. Jesus isn’t the Spirit, but he sends him from the Father, and gives only what is his own. The Spirit who guides into all truth—which must include theology!—does so by bringing us to the Father in his Son, the only God who is at the Father’s side and thus the only one who can make him known. Why would this apply any less to knowledge of the one God or his perfections? Jesus is the one in whom these hold together for us, too.</p>
<p id="pz185-10">We believe the desire of many contemporary theologians to take up the insight never to leave Jesus behind in our dogmatic reasoning should be strengthened, not weakened, by affirming the sheer Godness of God <span id="z186-6">implicated by robust doctrines of aseity and simplicity. But while aseity and simplicity can frame a fitting theology of God’s perfections, they cannot ground it or reveal its substance; rather, Trinity and Christology must be free to do their proper dogmatic work of informing the content and interrelations of our doctrinal claims if these claims are to faithfully describe the true God whose name is Father, Son, and Spirit.</span></p>

<p class="noind" id="pz186-8">It’s axiomatic that what happens in theology proper deeply shapes (or should) the remaining theological loci. God does what he does, in the way he does, because he is who he is. As we wrap up, we’d like to highlight two significant applications of the approach we’re advocating here.</p>
<p id="pz186-9">First, <i>God’s aseity applies no less to his activity than to his identity</i>. Christian theology has often been tempted to map the doctrine of God onto one or another intellectually or aesthetically or culturally compelling ontology. Think of the psychological analogy, the social analogy, or the analogy of love or of being. All such attempts at <i>extrapolating</i> the divine nature and its workings are risky, not least because to some extent we end up speaking of God by speaking about something else in a way that’s governed to some degree by our understanding of that other thing. The same temptation arises when we turn to other theological loci.</p>
<p id="pz186-10">Reasoning from God’s aseity throughout the dogmatic task helps us remember that the character of <i>this God’s</i> extrinsic activity is just as incomprehensibly unique and scandalously exclusive as he is. Creation, for example, isn’t something we can understand or even observe rightly unless we begin to speak of it theologically—from the beginning, <i>ex nihilo</i>. Where were we, as God asks Job (38:4)? The world and human beings within it have no category for speaking of what was not before it came to be, except through knowledge of the only One who has always been, the One through whose eternal Word everything came to be (the Word who himself came to be flesh, John 1:1–3, 14).</p>
<p id="pz186-11">Or take providence. Providence is simultaneously the most pervasive activity of God and completely undetectable in and of itself. At one and the same time, in the very same acts, God is active in divine wisdom, holiness, and grace, and we’re active in all the mixed motives of human beings. And don’t forget the countless layers or strands of nonhuman creaturely activity pervading and mediating every human act. Even God’s acting is mediated, <span id="z187-6">unapologetically so—indeed, so much so that his typical ways of acting constitute a large part of his hiddenness, veiled behind the rest of creation doing what to us feels alternately arbitrary or inevitable. Yet in all of it God is accomplishing exactly what he has intended from eternity. We could say the same sorts of things about the doctrines of humanity, salvation, and so on. God’s aseity grounds the uniqueness of both the Christian gospel and its dogmatic expressions.</span></p>
<p id="pz187-7">The second significant application of our approach we’d like to highlight is that <i>any conception of a divine perfection that precludes Jesus bearing that perfection is inadequate</i>. Theological reasoning that puts distance between the character of God and his ways, and the person and work of Jesus, diminishes the hope of the gospel. An aseity that cannot see Jesus as dependent on his teenage mother for bodily sustenance is a philosophical abstraction; an eternal person that cannot become flesh is a conception beneath the true dignity of God. The same goes for a Jesus who cannot suffer while he enjoys beatitude, or cannot uphold all things because he is forsaken, or cannot be wrathful because he bears sin for our sakes.</p>
<p id="pz187-8">How much of God do we get in Jesus? One third? More? Less? If we only know a part or aspect or effect of God’s character and action in Christ, then is he truly <i>God himself</i> with us? How could we ever be confident that we know the “immortal, invisible, God only wise” just because we’ve taken the word of a rabbi who walked the roads of Palestine and hung on a Roman cross two millennia ago? How can our hope be in God (1 Pet 1:21) if God isn’t <i>in</i> our hope? If Jesus’s heart is out of perfect sync with his Father’s heart in any way—indeed, if their heart for us isn’t <i>one</i>—then our hope is in vain. Christian hope isn’t playing the odds or wishing for the best. When the odds were impossible and the worst we could’ve imagined happened—the Savior of the world crucified, dead, buried, cursed—when the heart of God in Christ stopped beating, <i>that’s</i> when hope began to come alive for us. Our hope sits ruling at the Father’s right hand until he comes in glory, a living hope with a beating heart, which, though once stopped, will never cease again.</p>
<h2 id="pz187-9">C<span class="smallcaps" id="ARnG">ONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz187-10">We submit that consistently employing these two sets of coordinate doctrinal claims—aseity with simplicity and Trinity with Christology—allows theologians to more fully unfold a doctrine of the perfections that is unqualifiedly divine yet centered on the gracious revelation of the triune God in</p>
<p class="noind" id="pz188-1">Christ. This approach should, to the same extent, also assist us in carrying out the entire dogmatic task in deeper faith in and faithfulness to our one Lord. Aseity and simplicity keep us from thinking we can domesticate almighty God merely by describing him in and through our creaturely speech; Trinity and Christology keep us from having nothing worthwhile to say. So in all our theological reasoning, aseity is where we should begin, and simplicity is where we should end, but God in Christ is where we must stand.</p>
