<p class="noind" id="pAl_q">P<span class="smallcaps" id="AR8l">ERHAPS IT</span>’<span class="smallcaps" id="AYeP">S TRUE THAT OUR WESTERN CULTURE</span> turns on the reading of a book—but not quite the one we had in mind! Early in his education, Aurelius Augustine opened and read the rhetor Cicero’s work, now lost, <i>Hortensius</i>; and the world changed that day. In <i>Hortensius</i>, Augustine discovered the passionate longing for truth that was to animate all his days, and that gave us the remarkable Augustinian themes of Illumination, of the Transcendentals, and of the intellectual ascent to the True and Lovely Goodness who is God. Here is how Augustine expresses his captivity and his liberty in the light of Cicero’s essay: “It altered my outlook on life,” he wrote in his <i>Confessions</i>, “All my empty dreams suddenly lost their charm and my heart began to throb with a bewildering passion for the wisdom of eternal truth.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_1" id="ttf_12_1">1</a></sup> All of us in this room can recognize that raw tumult of that experience: it breathes the air of conversion. The old has passed away; behold the new has come. Augustine was nineteen when this revolution erupted in his young life. In the first blush of his new identity as philosopher, he returned to another Book, one that his mother Monica prized, the Bible. In those days, Cicero cast everything, even Holy Scripture, in the shade. Here is Augustine on that early reading of the Sacred Text: “To me the Scriptures seemed quite unworthy of comparison with the stately prose of Cicero, because I had too much conceit to accept their simplicity <span id="z132-6">and not enough insight to penetrate their depths. It is surely true that as the child grows these books grow with him. But I was too proud to call myself a child. I was inflated with self-esteem, which made me think myself a great man.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_2" id="ttf_12_2">2</a></sup> Characteristic of Augustine’s moral temper is his wrenching honesty that rushes all of us readers headlong down his <i>Confessions</i>; he will not give himself a cheap pardon, or an easy, embarrassed shrug at youthful vanities. No, Augustine is always set on a higher, or better, a deeper pathway, and he is relentless in his pursuit of the God who broke and remade him, who found him even as he sought Him, in tears and the singsong chants of little children. Without hesitation, Augustine trains his unflinching light on his own failings: he was too proud, he reports, too caught up in his own ambition and self-satisfaction to read a Book like the Bible. He was not ready to become a child of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p id="pz132-7">I begin with Augustine here, and the Augustine of the early <i>Confessions</i>, the Roman rhetor and Ciceronian, because I think Augustine is willing, even now, to be more forthright, more scandalously honest and searching than are we, centuries after learning from and being shaped by him. Augustine is willing to say that we cannot read the Bible if we lack certain moral traits—humility at the head—and he dares to say what we often cannot bring ourselves to admit: the Bible is a difficult, sometimes offensive Book to read. After years of Christian life, reflection, and worship, Augustine can echo his youthful disdain in a subtle and chastened form: “I discovered something that was at once beyond the understanding of the proud and hidden from the eyes of children. Its gait was humble [what a wonderful line!] but the heights it reached were sublime. It was enfolded in mysteries, and I was not the kind of man who could enter into it, or bow my head to follow where it led.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_3" id="ttf_12_3">3</a></sup> The Bible is a deeply mysterious Book, for Augustine, and it is not to be entered into lightly, and its exposition will require the whole of us, our intellect, our will, and our humble self-offering. It is a Book like no other.</p>
<p id="pz132-8">I suppose that this short summary—the Bible is a Book like no other—stands as my strongest conviction about Holy Scripture as Sacred Ground of theology. This unshakeable sense that the Bible confronts us as nothing else will or can; that it belongs to no kind or class; that it brooks no rival yet can speak to all; that it un-makes us as we read it; and that we can never come to the end of it—all this I find drawn up in the brief compass of Scripture’s uniqueness. All theology is properly reflection upon the Sacred Page, I say, <span id="z133-6">as the schoolmen do, and this is so because all Christian thought is to set its anchor deep into this strange soil, the bedrock that is the Bible.</span></p>
<p id="pz133-7">Now, Augustine has awakened the confessional impulse in me, and I must say too—in the midst of confessions about Scripture’s difficulties and offense—that in truth I simply love the Bible. I simply love to read it, and I think I always have. My mother and I used to sit cross-legged on the playroom floor and play the game, Bible Land, modelled on that ever-popular board game of my childhood, Candy Land. I loved the Bible verses and the vivid characters and their doings, the town names and the odd landscape, so alien to my own. I suppose my own future as teacher and theologian was signalled there on the simple, winding path of Bible Land and its homey pieties. The much-lamented John Webster—what a loss his death is to us all!—must have loved the Bible with an immediacy and passion that I could only hope for. His dogmatic work on Scripture, most especially on his simple and deep call to <i>read</i>, not categorize or explicate or worse, interpret, is I believe a complex, subtle, and healing appeal to the direct, unembarrassed love of Scripture.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_4" id="ttf_12_4">4</a></sup> And I think Calvin, too, may have had a passion for the Bible something like mine and John’s, although of course in the idiom of his day—and surely without the comfort of a cozy game of Bible Land! In the <i>Institutes</i>, Calvin writes warmly of the self-evident dignity and solemnity and power of Holy Scripture. He seemed to think that no one could pick up this Book, and put it down unimpressed; it spoke with a commanding voice. These were not the <i>grounds</i> for the Bible’s authority; <i>Sola Scriptura</i> does not rest on apologetic or experiential warrants such as these.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_5" id="ttf_12_5">5</a></sup> But Calvin lived in a Christian world, an Ecclesial one, as I did, even so many centuries on after the great Reformers, and it seemed unthinkable to him that the Bible would give offense, or be met with disdain.</p>
<p id="pz133-8">But those days, it seems, are gone. In these ways, as in so many others, we all now live in Augustine’s world: a diverse, secular, and pagan world with Christian overtones, one in which the Bible once again unfolds an alien world, one we cannot understand, one we do not prefer above all others. Of course this is a great impoverishment! We cannot hope these days to hold a candle to the Bible knowledge and mastery of our ancestors, of novelists and coal miners and school children and shopkeepers of only a few generations ago. One glance at any nineteenth-century novel will <span id="z134-6">tell us that. But under the <i>Providentia Dei</i>, this stubborn ignorance on our part is turned to our good. We now can see the striking and irresistible uniqueness of the Bible as our Christian ancestors did not. The Bible does not fit in any genre or kind, and in just this way serves as the irreplaceable, the unshakeable ground of dogmatics.</span></p>
<p id="pz134-7">Let me express all this in more formal terms. Holy Scripture, I believe, conforms to the odd strictures the English ethicist G. E. Moore applied to the notion of the good: the Bible, like the good, is “simple and unanalyzable,” it is “non-naturalized,” and it cannot be defined or identified with anything else.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_6" id="ttf_12_6">6</a></sup> It can be recognized, or acknowledged—“intuited” in the Kantian idiom of late Idealist thought—but it cannot be wholly described nor exhausted in any other category. The good, Moore taught us, is philosophically “primitive”: it rests at the bottom—or perhaps better, the top—of all else and it gives its own reality to everything else brought into its orbit. Goodness is its own reality, Moore tells us; it is strongly unique. Moore and his contemporary Sidgwick capture an intellectual position that I would like to extend to the place, dignity, and character of Holy Scripture: the Bible is strongly unique, and in just this way, stands at the beginning of all our theological ways. The Bible will be demanding to our intellect and our categories, offensive to us and a stone for stumbling, just because it <i>does not fit</i>. It is not a member of a class, not an instance, however exalted, of a larger kind, not an example or exemplar, not the best of all its kindred. No, the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the <i>kenō sis</i> of the proud and the <i>mystērion</i> of the humble; they are beyond all familiar landscapes, genres, and kinds. Just this is what it means to say that the Bible is not like anything else. It has no rival. It is strongly unique.</p>
<p id="pz134-8">Note that little word “strongly.” It is possible of course for objects and living things to be unique in a rather ordinary or weaker sense. This is the sense we intend when we note that a novel has characters that do not appear anywhere else; or when we say that we have never seen a landscape as striking and haunting as the mesas around the Central Valley; or when we affirm that each human being is unique, unlike any other, even if a twin, even if deeply known and loved by another. This kind of identity, this form of weaker uniqueness, has been given the term by Scotists, of “haecceitas,” “this-ness.” Now the medieval scholastic Duns Scotus had a remarkable and subtle notion of individuation, of the degerming property of “this-ness,” one that I find persuasive, especially in its claim that in the <span id="z135-6">end only Almighty God knows our identity, our haecceity truly. Scotus’s doctrine of individuation did not prevent him, however, from recognizing kinds and classes, the moderate universals of the medieval thought-world. So, though I think Scotus might be considered an ally of the position I want to develop here—or at least his thought might be opened to be strengthened and radicalized in this way—I think on its own, being <i>this very one</i>, being an individual, is not strong enough for the uniqueness I seek to accord to Holy Scripture. No, here lies something stronger.</span></p>
<p id="pz135-7">Let me set out some examples that might capture the elusive idea I have in mind. One of Friedrich Schleiermacher’s signal contributions to hermeneutics, the art of interpretation, was to argue that the Bible should be read as an ancient text, read like any other ancient text.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_7" id="ttf_12_7">7</a></sup> Now this is a rich and daring proposal! Note what it does to the understanding of Holy Scripture. First it assigns a class to which the Bible belongs: a text of the ancient world. It might even be narrowed some, to sacred texts of antiquity. It can find its place along the shelf that holds Cicero’s <i>Hortensius</i>, or the sacred poetry of the Lower Nile, or of Hesiod and his stories of the gods, or of Plato’s <i>Timeaus</i>. We develop certain tools and patterns of thought to read such texts: a knowledge of ancient Rome or golden age Greece or the late expansion of classical Egyptian culture into the delta of the Nile. We learn languages; we study syntax and vocabulary; we read across the literature of that ancient tongue. This is what our ancestors in the Faith called “lower criticism,” and it is the mainstay, to this day, of much beginning instruction in the reading of the Bible. Now I hasten to say here, and will elaborate in a moment, that I certainly do not want to discourage the thought of ancient languages, the practice of studying and mastering Hebrew or Greek or Latin, or the close, attentive study of ancient cultures and their sacred texts. No! To say that the Bible is strongly unique is not to practice a form of obscurantism in which ignorance is pious bliss. My point, rather, is to say that in all this study of the Bible as ancient text we have not yet encountered the Bible as Holy Scripture.</p>
<p id="pz135-8">Let me explore some additional examples, more demanding and more wide-spread in our contemporary theological world. Let me take the so-called “higher criticism” as my first example. Now here we assimilate the Holy Bible to a literary or historical text: it is a member of a well-known class, the cultural artifact of an earlier day. We say here that, like Julius <span id="z136-6">Caesar’s <i>The Gallic Wars</i>, we have a history that can be examined critically, held up against canons of historical research, and can be understood in light of the literary and rhetorical conventions of its day. I don’t need to tell anyone in this room that the story of <i>this</i> development in the reception of the Bible is a remarkably complex and still painful legacy of the modern world and its self-critical study of the past. David Friedrich Strauss’s application of the term <i>mythos</i> to the Bible was electric in his day, and remains so for many Christians in our era.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_8" id="ttf_12_8">8</a></sup> To say that Genesis or the Gospel of Luke is <i>mythos</i> is to say that it does not <i>refer to</i> historical events or material objects in a direct and verifiable manner. It is not narrating historical or scientific fact, in this view, and to say that in some way, perhaps as “folk-science” it aims to do so, is to open it to falsification. That the Bible could be <i>wrong</i>, that is, that it could contain factual errors, is an out-working of the assimilation of the Bible to the class and world of historical texts. Now I don’t want to pretend that I carry some dissolving fluid in my travelling kit that can simply erase or ease or wash away the deep and tangled dilemmas the higher criticism has posed for theology and for faithful Christians. Albert Schweitzer famously called the historical study of the Gospels a “painful school for honesty,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_9" id="ttf_12_9">9</a></sup> and I think it is probably a pilgrimage or fiery passage that all of us who belong to our time and culture must face and enter into.</span></p>
<p id="pz136-7">But here I simply want to raise a question about this initial move, the originary instinct to locate the Bible among a particular genre, the historical or instructional text. Here I think that more traditional positions, ones I might call Doctrines of Inerrancy, or of Plenary Inspiration, share more in common with modernist traditions than is sometimes recognized. In my eyes, what a strong Inerrantist position affirms, perhaps under the direct and mighty influence of the Holy Spirit, is that this One Book, the Bible, stands as a historical and moral record without error. It is like a history or ethics text; but this time, as a perfect one. The <i>place</i> of the Divine Inspiration, the <i>locus</i> of the Holy Spirit and the Bible’s authority, is raised to the level of the Bible’s <i>content</i>, to what it reports and records and teaches. The Bible is authoritative, the foundation of theology, in this view, just because it can be trusted to be <span id="z137-6">without error, unlike others of its kind, that sometimes relate the true facts and principles and at times do not. Now I happen to be a fallibilist about the Bible—I believe its matchless authority and beauty and power are compatible with error—but my main argument here is that the controversy over higher criticism is ill-suited for the work it intends to do. I want to remain <i>neutral</i>, that is, about Inerrancy and fallibilism, because I think the originary framework is wrong. I want to step behind this framework to a much stronger, much more radical notion of Biblical authority: it rests properly, I believe, on a strong notion of uniqueness. It is not enough to say that the Bible is a member of the class, historical, moral, and sacred texts, but this time a perfect one. It is not enough to say that it gives us a matchless or reliable or even flawless portrait of the people Israel and of our Lord, Jesus Christ. The Holy Scriptures are not that kind of Book—indeed not a kind, at all. It stands utterly alone, sovereign, majestic. It stands at the beginning of all our theological ways simply because there is nothing like it—really nothing at all.</span></p>
<p id="pz137-7">Let me give a final example that I think might illumine another feature of modern reading and reception of the Bible. Is the Bible <i>revelation</i>? Does it belong to that kind and class, revelatory texts? Does the Bible constitute the Revealed Word of God that is to be guide and ground of all Christian teaching? Now this conviction seems to me the hallmark of modern accounts of the Bible in contemporary theology. I will use the great name of Karl Barth here but I think his name in truth is legion, and there are many who hold to his views.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_10" id="ttf_12_10">10</a></sup> It is a remarkably powerful account. Here we move the Bible out of the realm of text—that in itself is a startling and radical decision. If we follow Barth we do not deny that the Bible is now a Book, nor do we lose sight of the patient and crucial tasks of editing, translating, and assessing manuscript variants that is all part of the textual legacy of Holy Scripture. But we do hold that the principle identity of the Bible is as revealed word: <i>Deus dixit</i>, thus says the Lord! The Bible in Barth’s hands is a form of <i>speech</i>, Divine Speech, and it addresses, encounters, judges, and guides the sinner along the ways of the Lord. The Bible as Revelation, then, has a temporal character; it inhabits the structure of speech that is a creature of time. God <i>speaks</i>, yes. And we live by that living Word. But God has also spoken; there is a proper past, a record, a deposit, and legacy of that speaking, that is the great gift and prize of Israel’s ordinances, commandments, and statutes. And the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD</span> God <i>will speak</i>; the future is also His. As the Revealer, the Lord retains the High Office of Prophet, the One who speaks to and for His people. Nothing is ever dead, <span id="z138-6">buried, lost, and irretrievable in the land of the Living God. In just this way, John Webster marvelously developed these Barthian notes by taking account of how Holy Scripture unfolds through the word of Prophet and Apostle, by the community gathered around the Living Word, by the tradents, the scribes, the collators and authors, all of them sharing the life-stream that pours forth from the God of Revelation, all sanctified creatures in His service. So, the written text is taken up into a larger class, the world of Divine Self-disclosure. This is why Barth’s Doctrine of Scripture has such remarkable vitality, such impressive dynamism. Nothing inert, nothing wholly given and lifeless here! Instead the Holy Spirit which has given the words to prophet and apostle, laid this speech down deep into the soil of Israel, can seize that revealed word and make it once again the Living Speech, the very Word of God. Barth calls this the Secondary Objectivity of the Word of God: Jesus Christ in His Secondary Identity as Divine Speech. The Bible can <i>become</i> this too.</span></p>
<p id="pz138-7">The splendid Barth scholar George Hunsinger calls this the “Chalcedonian relation,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_11" id="ttf_12_11">11</a></sup> and in this facet of the whole, he is joined by many modern Scripture scholars. The Bible for many of our contemporaries is a kind of two-nature reality: a Divine Word and a human artifact. The Bible must be a member of this Chalcedonian relation in just this sense, that the human or cultural nature must not be mixed or confused with the Divine, nor must they be entirely prised apart, the Divine lost sight of, say, or the creaturely ignored. It is a wonderfully imaginative and attractive proposal. We can see an elegant application of this proposal in the path-breaking Constitution of the Second Vatican Council, <i>Dei Verbum</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_12" id="ttf_12_12">12</a></sup> There, the Bishops suggested with a light touch that we might well consider the Bible as a kind of Sacrament, a verbal companion to the Holy Eucharist: it is Body and Blood of Christ, a nourishment and stay for pilgrims, all the while the creaturely properties remain, the taste and feel and weight of a human artifact. Two elements, held in complex relation. But even here, in the midst of several wide-ranging and evocative proposals, the Council Fathers gave this document the title the “Constitution on Divine Revelation,” and included a direct and rare citation from Vatican I and its pronounced accent upon proper theological knowledge to head the Constitution as a whole.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_13" id="ttf_12_13">13</a></sup> In all this, I want to underscore the <i>epistemic</i> character of the modern <span id="z139-6">interpretation of the Bible. To say that the Bible is <i>revelation</i>, even the event of Christ’s Lordly speaking, is to train our eyes upon <i>knowledge</i>, the Source, the content, and the Means whereby we know the deep things of God. In just this way, it belongs to the modern. Nothing has so preoccupied modern philosophers and theologians than the problem of knowledge: its certainties, its pathways, its verification, its success in referent or judgement or progress in scientific endeavor. To say that dogmatics finds its foundation in revelation, in the event of Divine Speech, is to house theology in the living quarters of epistemology, the art of knowers and the known. Now of course there are metaphysical dimensions or implicatures to any epistemology; the Chalcedonian relation tells us that. And Barth himself is far too accomplished and complex a theologian to ever reduce a theological locus to any one discipline. But I think all the same the strong magnetic pull of modern conceptuality, and the fascinating rigors of post-Cartesian thought, has drawn the Bible itself within its orbit, and made it a citizen of its domains. As modern people, we are ineluctably drawn to the notion that the Bible tells us something we need to learn, teaches us something we could not find elsewhere, and lifts the veil that covers the nations so that we now know the Living God. To affirm all this is to say that the Bible is Source, perhaps matchless source, of knowledge; it is to affirm that Christians are those who <i>know</i> because properly instructed.</span></p>
<p id="pz139-7">Now I want to say a rather odd thing about all these comparison classes and kinds. I do not want to <i>reject</i> them, nor deny that they might be fitting, perhaps remarkably illuminating for understanding the Bible. I do indeed think it possible to treat the Bible in all these ways, and even more, that we can learn many things, even very many, valuable things, by doing so. But I think this is so for an odd reason. I believe the Bible can be grouped into many kinds and classes, its strong uniqueness hidden away like a measure of meal in a jar, just because it does not belong to any of the known genres on this earth. The Bible is so strange, that is, so removed from ordinary, earthly objects, that it cannot even be contrasted with them. This is a species of the common “apple and oranges” maxim. In that well-known phrase, we say that we can’t really compare the apple with the orange because there is simply not enough to tie them together in order to see them as distinct. (Now, in the annoying way of every-day maxims, it’s possible of course to find commonality—they are both fruits! But that’s not really the point of the maxim, we know, so we cut that home-spun example some slack.) Let me give another, slightly more elevated, example of this point. Thomas Aquinas tells us very early on in his great <i>Summa Theologiae</i> that in order to <span id="z140-6">disagree we must hold certain elements in common—his disputants must believe, on both sides, in God or in Holy Scripture or that there is such a reality as the Church—in order to dispute and argue at all. In this surprising way, to argue is in some ways to simply agree.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_14" id="ttf_12_14">14</a></sup> So, it seems to me that the Bible simply does not hold enough in common with other books or speech or sacred artifact to be compared, to be shown distinct, or to excel over them. The strong uniqueness of the Bible means, in this way, that it can be grouped almost anywhere. It is a “universal donor,” in virtue of its unexcelled identity. Just this makes us say, the Bible is Holy, Holy Scripture.</span></p>
<p>Note here that I am quietly affirming that in some distinctive ways, the Bible is likened only to Almighty God. This is a daring and rather dangerous proposition, so I want to linger a moment on this claim of mine. One of the ways that Holy Scripture is like the Lord God Himself is the manner in which the Bible, like our Majestic God, does not compete with or fight for space in the creaturely realm. This is what the marvelous theologian Kathryn Tanner calls the “non-competitive relation” between God and creature: God cannot be <i>over against</i> the creature just because God is so utterly Unique and Sovereign.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_15" id="ttf_12_15">15</a></sup> They would have to have altogether too much in common to differ as competitors for acting or taking up space in the world. This is why God can be present <i>within</i> us, <i>within</i> our Churches, our Sacraments, our souls. We do not have to drive something away to make room for Divine Presence; no, God is the Radical Other who can act and give Himself all the while the creature stands and acts and thrives. In Him we live and move and have our being, Scripture teaches us, and that is so because God is strongly Unique. Note that this is a reworking of the Doctrine of Transcendence, a point Tanner makes in several remarkable ways in her essays. For Almighty God to transcend everything in heaven and on the earth is not the same thing as God ‘being far away,’ standing remote and hidden from creatures. No, transcendence, properly understood, is a form of <i>nearness</i>, of Presence. Just so, I say, the Bible as unique can stand utterly close to the earthly genres and kinds it does not in truth occupy; it transcends them by standing near to them.</p>
<p id="pz140-7">But we can say more still about the common character of Holy Scripture and the Living Lord. When we speak of the Bible as Holy Scripture—its own proper identity—we say simply that we encounter God there. I want <span id="z141-6">to underscore that verb, encounter. I do not think the Bible’s holiness stems from some truth it contains, though to be sure it contains many. Nor do I think its holiness can be anchored to its particular events, histories, and peoples, though to be sure the Bible is a specific book from an elect nation. No, the Bible is Holy, the Holy Scripture of the Old and New Covenants, just because we meet God there. The Bible, in this sense, is a <i>mode of Divine Presence</i>. Like the nature of the good that G. E. Moore tells us can only be recognized, acknowledged, not defined or described in any other terms, so the Bible as God’s Medium and Means can only be <i>accepted</i>, recognized, affirmed, admitted. In truth I believe it is stronger than that still. I think the Lord God Himself must give us the eyes, the ears, the heart to acknowledge His Presence in Holy Writ. This is the inescapable dimension of faith in the establishment of the Bible as foundation of all dogmatics. We do not know God, nor encounter Him, nor worship Him apart from Him; He is the Gracious Opener of our heart and mind to His Reality, His Hidden Majesty. Just this, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, is the Doctrine of Inspiration of Holy Scripture. There is of course a long history of the Doctrine of Inspiration, particularly in the post-Reformation Churches, and it turns, in part, on the distinction between the inspiration of the text and the inspiration of the readers. But it will not surprise you by now to learn that I do not think this framework is the right one to apply here. We need not, indeed I believe cannot, choose between text and reader, nor do we want to cut the Gordian knot by simply affirming both. No, we step behind, beyond, the framework itself to see just what it means to say that we, in God’s grace, encounter God in Holy Scripture. Inspiration, rather, is the name we give to the meeting of God in the Bible. Like the Fiery Presence of God in the burning bush, we encounter the Fire who is God in the thornbush, we remove our sandals, we turn aside from our daily path and task, we are ourselves addressed and sent, commanded and commandeered and changed, and the thornbush is not consumed. Note that all these elements come together to form one call narrative—indeed <i>the call narrative</i> of all Holy Scripture—as a seamless garment. We do not properly ask in what way God is in the bush, nor what parts of the shrub are bearers of God, or God’s Holy Name, nor whether we simply know the Name now, nor discover what kind of event and class a “theophany” is, nor whether we could be drawn aside from our flocks and herds and remain the same, nor do we want to spend much time thinking of the bush itself—just what class and kind and perfection it might exhibit. No, what the encounter by Moses of the Lord God in the thorn-bush narrates </span><span id="z142-6">is the living, vital <i>axis</i> of all Holy Scripture. It is the seamless event that characterized and captures the whole of the Bible: it is the part that is the whole. The One Lord burns there, and the creature remains. That is the miracle of Divine Presence, the miracle of the Bible as Holy Scripture. Because Inspiration just is the encounter with one’s Maker and Lord in Holy Scripture; there is no need, no room, in truth, for discrete categories such as Revelation or Inerrancy or Conversion requires. We do not ask about the character of the thornbush that makes it the fit bearer for the Divine Name and Fire, nor do we linger at the bush should the Fiery Presence depart. No, we stand in the Holy Precincts here, and the Mystery who is God captivates us, draws us near, sends us forth, undermines all that once was so, and pours revolution, liberty, into this tired earth. Now, the Bible is this Fiery Thornbush. That is why we meet God there.</span></p>
<p id="pz142-7">Now, notice here that I am not drawing an explicit christological analogy. I do not think that the recent proposals to liken Holy Scripture to the Person of our Lord Christ can in truth advance our cause to honor and properly read the Bible. Of course it is a natural assumption for we Christians to make! I would not want to deny that the very notion of the Word of God raises most properly in our minds the Reality of Jesus Christ, the Word of the Father. And to be sure this parallel allows modern readers of the Bible a doctrinal way to honor the creaturely and frail character of the Prophets, the Apostles, and Evangelists who transcribe the sayings and events and actors within Sacred History. It seems at first blush to dissolve many riddles, for we can conceptually locate a human and a Divine nature within the covers of this one Book, and we can find proper value in the altogether human work of hearing, recording, editing, and passing on the traditions once given to the saints. But I think we have reason to hesitate before this widely admired solution. For one, of course, I would not be drawn to such an analogy because I do not think it captures properly the strong uniqueness of Scripture: it is not like anything else, even the Two Nature Christology of our Lord’s Person. But I think we can be bolder still. The Modes of Divine Presence, the manners in which our Lord God manifests Himself are each <i>strongly unique</i>. I think we can affirm this even in the face of the time-honored Augustinian maxim that all the works of God <i>ad extra</i> are one. This is so, I would hazard to say, because Jesus Christ Himself, the Incarnate Son, is without peer, without rival, without genre and kind to His own Glorious Reality. The Incarnation is simply His own Life, and not another. There is nothing that in truth belongs to this Superabundant Gift, no member in a larger set, no instance of <span id="z143-6">the greater genre. No, Christ is Lord just in this way: that He is Utterly Unique, the Only Begotten Son. His is the Mode of the Incarnation, His the Unique Mode of His own Presence among us. “He comes among us as One Unknown,” as Schweitzer wrote in an elegiac conclusion to his <i>Quest of the Historical Jesus</i>, and He makes Himself known as Lord; He calls and commands and remakes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12_16" id="ttf_12_16">16</a></sup> There is no one and nothing like Him.</span></p>
<p id="pz143-7">Even so we should say that there is no one and nothing like the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. They are a Mode of Divine Presence that is its own, a banner planted in the earth that has no peer or likeness. For this reason, the Bible is read as no other book can be. Theology does not rest upon it, and draw its guidance and life there, because it is traditional to do so, or even that it is the heritage and instruction of the magisterial Reformers to do so, nor that it is the Christians’ Sacred Text. No, none of these warrants for Scripture as Sacred Ground of theology is strong enough, radical enough, for the place of the Bible in dogmatics. The Bible as the place where we encounter God stands at the head because it can stand nowhere else. It does not belong to the world as other ordinary creatures do. It does not find its place in the stream of all living things, and stand there or stand out there as a powerful or disturbing exemplar. Rather it is so unlike its seeming kin that it can only stand at the <i>origin</i>, the beginning of all theology’s ways and works. It is foundational in this strong sense, that even placed <i>in media res</i> or at the end it will remain first, sovereign, original. We will find the history of Israel there, the history and words of Prophets and Apostles; we will find as glorious goal of all these, the words and deeds and victory of Jesus Christ; all these will be read and learned and found there. But we turn to this Book of Books, this Holy Fire, not because we learn of these things in its pages, but because we meet God there, the very One who chose and formed and taught the People Israel, and the very One who came among us in the Son, mighty to save. Not in virtue of the content, then, but in virtue of the Divine Presence is the Bible the Unique Ground of all theology, of all Christian prayer and contrition and praise. In just this way is Holy Scripture a mighty sword, an unchained word, a refuge and hiding place, and a lamp unto our feet. There really is no other.</p>
