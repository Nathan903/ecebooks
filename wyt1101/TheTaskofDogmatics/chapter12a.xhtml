This entails not only thinking about theological topics, hearing anew the Holy Spirit and the Word of God who are speaking in Scripture, but also about what theology is and how it ought to be practiced as intellectual labor. This is the question of theological method, and as a practice of the Christian church it requires careful attention. What we aim here to establish are not principles that stand outside of the discipline of theology, which must be established first in order for its inquiry to be made. Rather all talk of method—principles of judgment, sources and norms, or the ordering of doctrines—is itself already theological. In this sense, there is no such thing as theological <i>prolegomena</i>; to speak about method is already to begin to undertake the work.</p>
<p id="pz144-6">The history of Christian thought reveals no shortage of distinct methods. What principles ought one adopt? What are the theologian’s sources <span id="z145-6">and norms? How, for example, ought Holy Scripture and the traditions of the church be set in relation? And which doctrine or doctrines are wisely given priority over others, so that the decisions one makes with regard to the center of dogmatics benefits the whole? In this essay I will put two such proposals from the modern period into dialogue. The first belongs to Karl Barth, who is today the figure perhaps most associated with a “Christocentric” method. The second is that of John Webster, who has articulated a theology from the doctrine of the Trinity, in particular one that is ordered to the richness of God’s inner life.</span></p>
<p id="pz145-7">I will proceed in three stages. The first is a summary of what it means to call Barth a Christocentric theologian, and the second, a discussion of Webster’s principled orientation to the doctrine of God. In both instances I will briefly probe each one’s motivations for these programmatic decisions. The third stage is constructive. In place of common but simplistic pictures of dogmatics as founded upon a “starting point” or “center,” I will propose a more complex analogy drawn from the sphere of mathematics.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_1" id="ttf_12a_1">1</a></sup> This, I think, equips dogmatic theology with more helpful (and realistic) ways of relating Trinity, Christology, and other doctrines vital to Christian confession. Among its many benefits this model enables us to see that the Christocentrism of Barth and the Theocentrism of Webster are not in conflict.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz145-9">Karl Barth’s radical Christocentrism has been well-documented.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_2" id="ttf_12a_2">2</a></sup> Jesus Christ stands at the center of theological reflection not only because of the relative importance of the doctrines of incarnation and atonement to the Christian presentation, and not only because as God-made-flesh he is <span id="z146-6">the locus and mediator of divine revelation to creatures, but also because Jesus himself is the mystery of God—the very content of revelation, the mystery kept hidden for ages past but now made manifest to the people of God (Col 1:25–26).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_3" id="ttf_12a_3">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz146-7">In its authentic expression, the Christian message does not communicate an idea or concept but declares a name—the name of Jesus Christ. And it binds all things to this name, for all of our concepts—God, human, time, eternity, grace, atonement, <i>et cetera</i>—“derive their significance only from the bearer of this name and from His history, and not the reverse.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_4" id="ttf_12a_4">4</a></sup> They have no special significance or meaning independent of his name, nor is there anything in the Christian message which floats free from it. This appoints to Christology a certain privilege, and assigns to the theologian a definite responsibility:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz146-8"><p class="blo">A church dogmatics must, of course, be christologically determined as a whole and in all its parts, as surely as the revealed Word of God, attested by Holy Scripture and proclaimed by the Church, is identical with Jesus Christ. If dogmatics cannot regard itself and cause itself to be regarded as fundamentally Christology, it has assuredly succumbed to some alien sway and is already on the verge of losing its character as church dogmatics.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_5" id="ttf_12a_5">5</a></sup></p> 
</blockquote>
<p id="pz146-9">What is this “alien sway” about which Barth worried? It may be politics or culture, philosophy or academic ambition, or preoccupations with apologetics or historical criticism.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_6" id="ttf_12a_6">6</a></sup> In short it is anything that would compete with God’s <i>self</i>-disclosure, “every (positive or negative) <i>formulation of a system</i> which claims to be theological . . . whose <i>subject</i>, however, differs fundamentally from the revelation in Jesus Christ and whose <i>method</i> therefore differs equally from the exposition of Scripture.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_7" id="ttf_12a_7">7</a></sup> Barth had the theology of the nineteenth century in view when he summarized all such efforts <span id="z147-6">as “natural theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_8" id="ttf_12a_8">8</a></sup> The churchly character of dogmatics is lost where theology’s object and method turn upon the human creature, her needs, and her interests, rather than upon God.</span></p>
<p id="pz147-7">In order to maintain fidelity to God as the object of her inquiry the theologian must uphold this positive orientation to Jesus Christ—not only with respect to the pattern of doctrines and their organization but also as it pertains to her own exercise of faith. This is especially true where the task is “dogmatics,” that is, as it takes place “within the sphere of the church and of faith’s confession of the gospel.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_9" id="ttf_12a_9">9</a></sup> Christocentrism for Barth thus speaks neither to a material principle (<i>in abstracto</i>),<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_10" id="ttf_12a_10">10</a></sup> nor to the deduction of a system <i>a priori</i> from a single starting point, but concretely to the one who bears this name. He is the one who is lord of the Christian life, a life which includes all aspects of theological contemplation and proclamation (what John Webster summarizes as the exercise of “redeemed intelligence”). To the theologian this is not only a command but a promise, for Christ is not only the content of the Christian message but also the one who by his Spirit is its guarantor. In the theologian’s speech, “He Himself is there and at work, He Himself makes Himself to be recognised and acknowledged.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_11" id="ttf_12a_11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>From one volume to the next throughout the <i>Church Dogmatics</i>, Barth makes it clear that this living Word must never drift into the periphery. The knowledge of God depends upon Christ as its condition and actuality (<i>CD</i> II/1); Jesus is both the electing God and the elect human (II/2); creation is given meaning in the covenant which culminates in Jesus Christ (III/1); true and original humanity is not a category applied to the incarnate one <i>ab extra</i> but only discovered in him (III/2); revelation and reconciliation are coterminous concepts which find no expression apart from Christ (IV/1–2).</p>
<p id="pz147-8">Even when he addresses the freedom of God—a theme which some <span id="z148-6">interpreters suggest frustrates attempts to prioritize God’s divine-human history <i>ad extra</i><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_12" id="ttf_12a_12">12</a></sup>—Barth is finally preoccupied with the expression of this freedom in the concrete, particular reality of the history of Jesus Christ. All other meanings of divine freedom are finally relativized, as <i>potentia absoluta</i>, in the light of what God does. God is perfect in God’s own life, in no need of creatures nor of an incarnation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_13" id="ttf_12a_13">13</a></sup> And yet, Barth says, this freedom is exercised and made definite in the election of Jesus Christ. Not only are the immanence of God and the freedom of God known in Jesus, but in him they in fact consist:</span></p> 
<blockquote id="pz148-7"><p class="blo">The freedom of God must be recognized as His own freedom and this means—as it consists in God and as God has exercised it. But in God it consists in His Son Jesus Christ, and it is in Him that God has exercised it. In all its possibilities and shapes, it remains the freedom which consists and is exercised in Jesus Christ. If we recognize and magnify it, we cannot come from any other starting-point but Him or move to any other goal.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_14" id="ttf_12a_14">14</a></sup></p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz148-8">As the one who is free, God <i>loves</i> in his freedom. And so in God’s self-commitment to creatures—which is the history of Jesus Christ—God is supremely exercising his freedom. Christology demonstrates that God’s freedom and God’s loving are not in competition, for God is “the One who loves in the very act of His existence.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_15" id="ttf_12a_15">15</a></sup> Therefore, Barth continues, Christology “must always constitute the basis and criterion for the apprehension and interpretation of the freedom of God in His immanence.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_16" id="ttf_12a_16">16</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz148-9">These are but a few representative examples of the ways in which Barth’s christological concentration plays out in his <i>Dogmatics</i>. It serves a variety of practical purposes in his thought, not least of which is a particularism which seeks to avoid the sort of speculation regarding God and God’s attributes that had characterized much of Western theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_17" id="ttf_12a_17">17</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz149-6">Finally, we should note that when Barth says “Jesus Christ,” he means the God-human and not the Logos <i>simpliciter</i> (nor, we should hasten to add, the human Jesus <i>simpliciter</i>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_18" id="ttf_12a_18">18</a></sup> This is the one who is the very Son of God, and whose existence as <i>vere homo</i> is elected in eternity and actualized in time. With this name, Barth never means to suggest a second person of the Trinity who is independent of his incarnation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_19" id="ttf_12a_19">19</a></sup> Rather it is the divine-human Jesus Christ who is the agent of revelation, election, creation, reconciliation, and redemption.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_20" id="ttf_12a_20">20</a></sup> And he is identical with the revealed Word of God, which to Barth suggests that Jesus Christ is not only the place of divine revelation but also its content. <i>Theo</i>-logy <i>is</i> Christology—just as surely as God is human.</p>
<p id="AmEW">There seems to be little in the way of middle ground between Barth’s supporters and his critics when it comes to this matter. The former marvel at Barth’s consistent and profound orientation of all doctrinal topics to the person and work of Christ. This principal conviction is so fundamental to Barth’s project that, without it, it is difficult to imagine the <i>Church Dogmatics</i> attaining the same stature over the past two generations. Without his christological concentration, Barth would not be Barth. His critics, on the other hand, have long decried this method as a “Christomonism,” a pejorative suggesting that Barth maintains such a singular focus on Christ that at key moments other necessary conclusions are overwhelmed or crowded out.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_21" id="ttf_12a_21">21</a></sup> (Barth replied that while theology ought not lose its focus on Jesus Christ <span id="z150-6">and the union of God and humankind in him, theology must avoid any “monism” as inevitably reductive.)<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_22" id="ttf_12a_22">22</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz150-7">This was far from Webster’s own objection, however. Though he was concerned with proper proportionality in dogmatics, Webster also acknowledged the salutary value of Barth’s unflinchingly christological concentration: “Barth rarely reduces all other doctrines to derivatives or implicates of Christology,” and he “remains convinced that Christology and Trinity are inseparable and mutually implicating, and that teaching about the immanent Trinity is of great Christological import.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_23" id="ttf_12a_23">23</a></sup> Barth was enthusiastic in affirming Jesus Christ as the center and condition for theological contemplation, but when talk turned to “Christocentrism” as a program, he was cautious, deliberate, and not reckless. But Webster’s own convictions regarding method, procedure, and the place of Christology in systematic theology were rather different. To these we now turn.</p>
<h2 id="pz150-8">J<span class="smallcaps" id="AX-V">OHN</span> W<span class="smallcaps" id="ADCs">EBSTER ON</span> T<span class="smallcaps" id="AnhM">RINITARIAN</span> D<span class="smallcaps" id="AQP6">OGMATICS</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz150-9">“Systematic theology,” Webster says, “has a single but not simple object: God and all things relative to God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_24" id="ttf_12a_24">24</a></sup> This perhaps deceptively simple program is reflected in what Webster takes to be the proper order for dogmatics: the doctrine of God is prior to the economy of God’s works, both materially and so also logically, since the being of God in and for himself is the ground of God’s works.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_25" id="ttf_12a_25">25</a></sup> For although it is possible to conceive of God without creation it is impossible to conceive of creation without God. Indeed, the whole of God’s activity in the economy of creation and redemption overflows from the fullness of life that God has in himself.</p>
<p id="pz150-10">In the terms provided by medieval scholasticism, theology begins with the inner relations and processions of the Trinitarian persons. And it continues on from there to the missions of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—what Webster calls the “hinge” between God <i>in se</i> and God’s works <i>ad extra</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_26" id="ttf_12a_26">26</a></sup> <span id="z151-6">To speak then of divine perfections (or attributes) is properly to coordinate procession and mission—that is, to describe <i>this</i> God who acts in <i>these</i> ways.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_27" id="ttf_12a_27">27</a></sup> In a very real sense, then, for Webster, talk of the Holy Trinity will comprehend the whole of theological contemplation. This doctrine is not one among others but is foundational, the “ruler and judge” over all other Christian teaching. And it is all-encompassing, he says, so that “to expound the doctrine of the Trinity in its full scope is to expound the entirety of Christian dogmatics.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_28" id="ttf_12a_28">28</a></sup> In this sense, “there is only one Christian doctrine, the doctrine of the triune God, because in following that doctrine to its end theology will treat all the topics customarily brought together in a systematic theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_29" id="ttf_12a_29">29</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz151-7">Although this material order is irreversible, the order of exposition need not follow suit. Webster acknowledges that “it would be quite possible to begin an account of Christian doctrine at any point, provided that proper attention is paid to systematic scope in order to prevent the hypertrophy of one article at the price of the atrophy of another.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_30" id="ttf_12a_30">30</a></sup> What matters is not that the order of knowing replicates the order of being but that the former not be allowed to overwhelm the latter (that is, to permit the economy to be determinative of God’s essential being). So long as the material order remains intact, the theologian is free to invent or adapt the presentation of doctrine as didactic circumstances require.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_31" id="ttf_12a_31">31</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz151-8">This does not mean that all theologies are equally sound in construction, so long as they pay sufficient deference to the Trinity. Webster is also concerned to warn of the inflation and imbalance of certain doctrines, naming Christology and soteriology as often guilty parties.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_32" id="ttf_12a_32">32</a></sup> Such disproportion occurs when a given doctrine is assigned more work than it can bear, or when the theologian inserts a gap between the being of God and the works of God such that the latter might be expounded without reference to the former. Attempts to define any other doctrine as <i>articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae</i>, or to organize dogmatics around it as a central dogma, must be checked in the interests of proportion.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_33" id="ttf_12a_33">33</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz152-6">Theology thus begins with God’s inner life and ought to maintain proper proportion in the span of its attention. To aid in this, Webster often invokes the notion of a “distributed doctrine.” This is an aspect of Christian teaching which cannot be treated and dispensed with all at once in systematics because its import and effects are spread throughout the whole. The doctrine of the Trinity is first among these, since no other topic can be understood adequately without reference to God’s inner and outer works. At various places in his corpus, Webster also identifies as distributed doctrines those of creation (and creation <i>ex nihilo</i>) and providence.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_34" id="ttf_12a_34">34</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz152-7">Most significant for our present inquiry is that he regards Christology, too, to be a distributed doctrine: “No element in a system of theology is unrelated to Christology: to contemplate any of its parts is to have one’s mind drawn irresistibly to the name and figure of Jesus Christ.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_35" id="ttf_12a_35">35</a></sup> In this way, Christology is privileged not as a starting point or basis for all other doctrines, but as an integral element of the doctrine of God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_36" id="ttf_12a_36">36</a></sup> Because it considers one of the persons of the Trinity, Christology is treated both immanently and relatively, and so it straddles the two domains of systematic theology (theology and economy) in treating both the eternal Word and his temporal mission. The Son’s mission includes his participation in creation and the providential maintenance of the world (Col 1:16–17; Heb 1:1–3) as well as the whole course of salvation—his incarnation, earthly ministry, passion and death, resurrection, ascension, and ongoing intercession at the right hand of the Father.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_37" id="ttf_12a_37">37</a></sup> If Webster has anything approaching a “Christocentric” instinct, it is here, situated carefully within the doctrine of God.</p>
<p id="pz152-8">What may be said about Webster’s likely motivations for outlining this sort of theological method? Positively put, he clearly believes that the priority of the doctrine of God is simply suited to theology’s object. But we can also speculate regarding the negative side: What is he driven to avoid? What sorts of “theology” does Webster wish to rule out with this methodology, either as harmful or as simply improper? I believe that, like Barth, his approach is provoked in part by worry over “some alien sway” <span id="z153-6">which could invade and subvert—causing the theologian to be distracted by concerns, presuppositions, or outcomes which are at best secondary to her task and, at worst, foreign and destructive. This is evident in Webster’s 1997 inaugural lecture at the University of Oxford, in which he pled for a “theological theology”: theology makes its most fruitful contribution to learning not by conformity to the disengaged reason of the academy but precisely by its nonconformity, a renewed “conflict of the faculties.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_38" id="ttf_12a_38">38</a></sup> He means that nonconformity permits the theologian to exercise her redeemed intelligence according to the restrictions and requirements not of the modern professional guild but those of the Word of God—that is, to be dogmatic. Christian theology is distinctive among the sciences not merely because it persistently raises questions of ultimacy for conversation at the bar of reason, but “in its invocation of God as agent in the intellectual practice of theology. In order to give account of its own operations, that is, Christian theology will talk of God and God’s actions”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_39" id="ttf_12a_39">39</a></sup> and not merely of the phenomena of human perception and imperception.</span></p>
<p id="pz153-7">Without such self-understanding, theology that has assimilated itself to the rules of the modern university and its accepted modes of <i>Wissenschaft</i> risks benign indifference or, much worse, an erosion of confidence in its ability to speak truthfully of its subject matter. Understanding systematic theology primarily as a mode of public engagement has the result that, in the end, little tends to be said of God in himself.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_40" id="ttf_12a_40">40</a></sup> Theology that has lost its nerve to be “theological” (which Webster thought to be the sort of theology commonly practiced within the halls of the English- and German-speaking academy) is simply not theology at all.</p>
<p id="pz153-8">All of this is not unrelated to a second worry, which Barth shared. The specter of historical Jesus studies, and with it an attending reduction of Christology to “Jesuology,” has been ever-present to theologians since the nineteenth century. Webster places Christology under the auspice of the doctrine of the Trinity, requiring the divine Son’s preexistence and full deity, in order to ward off those naturalistic, overly historicized, and other nontheological accounts of Christ that have pervaded the modern <span id="z154-6">period.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_41" id="ttf_12a_41">41</a></sup> Even where they might grant Jesus’s divine identity, these accounts concentrate so totally on the history of the Word made flesh that they neglect that history’s backward reference to the eternal, triune persons as its antecedent ground.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_42" id="ttf_12a_42">42</a></sup> Therefore such accounts, Webster says, have led variously to “an expansion of the domain of the economy, a corresponding contraction of the domain of theology,” and heightened expectations of Jesus’s person and acts as historical quantities.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_43" id="ttf_12a_43">43</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz154-7">It should be said that this is not a rejection of Christocentrism as Barth practiced it. In fact, it aims at a shared target: a distortion of dogmatics by the divergent interests of modern rationalism. The subject of Christology is not isolated historicism (nor is it an entirely subjective religious experience); rather, it is the objective and ongoing <i>presence</i> of Christ, his reconciling men and women to God by giving himself to them.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_44" id="ttf_12a_44">44</a></sup> In ordering the doctrine of Christ to that of the Trinity, once again Webster’s implicit concern is that one does not produce a Christology that is not “theological.”</p>
<p id="pz154-8">These are high stakes that lie close at hand when Webster argues for a form of Theocentrism. Theology’s <i>principium cognoscendi</i> reflects the <i>principium essendi</i> upon which it rests; the venture of Christian theology fittingly reflects the beatitude of God in himself and the benevolence of God for creatures.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_45" id="ttf_12a_45">45</a></sup> Christology too deserves a certain privilege, but by its nature the doctrine of the Trinity is more comprehensive and indeed will include within itself the full reach of Christology. Both Barth and Webster are similarly motivated: Barth grounds theological speech upon Jesus Christ so as to thwart appeals to anthropology, while Webster insists upon theology’s divine objectivity and subjectivity in order to loosen the grip of naturalism and provoke the theologian to repentance. If their goals are not dissimilar, <span id="z155-6">then perhaps their methods and priorities need not be regarded as at odds. For Barth theology is centered on Christ, and this ever points to the triune God; for Webster theology begins with the Trinity, and this includes all of Christology within it. In what follows I will offer a constructive proposal for reading these two together.</span></p> 
<h2 id="pz155-7">T<span class="smallcaps" id="AGy4">HEOLOGY</span>’<span class="smallcaps" id="Asji">S</span> P<span class="smallcaps" id="AqfO">ATTERN AND</span> N<span class="smallcaps" id="AICi">ORM</span> (A P<span class="smallcaps" id="AnsO">ROPOSAL</span>) </h2>
<p class="noind" id="AOet">When theologians speak of their methods, of the arrangement of topics in the system of doctrine and which teachings ought to shape the contents of others, it is common to speak either of a “starting point” or a “center.” The first of these is linear: it suggests a single point of departure which provides a basis for the next topic, and then each subsequent doctrine down the line until the whole range of the system has been explicated. Doctrine here is regarded as cumulative in nature, even if only implicitly; <i>order</i> is crucial, as what is explicated first will have the greatest formative impact. What comes last, by contrast, may be the most comprehensive or summative of the whole.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_46" id="ttf_12a_46">46</a></sup> As the work proceeds, its contents grow increasingly full and dynamic because each new topic has a larger accumulation behind it upon which to draw. The analogy of “building” expresses this same idea, with the foundation representing that one article upon which the whole stands or falls (the doctrine of justification for Martin Luther).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_47" id="ttf_12a_47">47</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz155-8">The second common form taken by systematic theologies speaks of a center point, a controlling doctrine or theme around which the whole of the material is organized. Other topics may be located closer to or further from the center, with varying proximities to one another but all oriented to that central, controlling doctrine. Encircling this teaching is the circle’s circumference, which either suggests the limits of orthodoxy which are not to be crossed (a boundary-set), or a frontier ripe for exploration so long as one moves out from the center taking care not lose her bearings (a center-set). Order is now less decisive than <i>orientation</i>, or perhaps direction. From this model arise the many proposals for “Christocentrism,” “anthropocentrism,” “soteriocentrism,” “ecclesiocentrism,” and the like. Karl Barth himself draws upon circle imagery in tentative and somewhat unconventional ways, <span id="z156-6">suggesting a theology that begins on the circumference of a circle (the center of which is the Word of God) and is directed outward.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_48" id="ttf_12a_48">48</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz156-7">If the linear picture may be described as “one-dimensional” and the geometric as “two-dimensional” might there be other, more fully orbed ways of depicting the relationship between doctrines and the mode of their exposition? Perhaps there is another analogy drawn from mathematics that might provoke dogmatics to the imagination necessary for its task. For the sake of this essay I will bypass my unformed thoughts about what shape theological exposition might take if it were called “three-dimensional” (“exponential,” or perhaps “logarithmic”). Certainly, examples from the history of theology can be found.</p>
<p id="pAe4g">The model I wish to propose instead is better described as a four-dimensional picture of systematic theology. Fractal geometry is a relative newcomer to the discipline of mathematics, first devised in 1975 and popularized during the 1980s. It has proved immensely useful in numerous disciplines, and can be seen throughout the natural world in both microcosm and macrocosm. In short, fractals are the repetition of a set pattern producing an increasingly complex symmetry, wherein the microcosm replicates the macrocosm perfectly in scale. The most simple example is the Koch curve: beginning with an equilateral triangle, replace the middle third of each line segment with two segments at 60-degree angles. The result is the 12-sided Star of David. Now, repeat the process <i>ad infinitum</i>. The result is the Koch snowflake, a shape with a finite area bounded by a line that is infinitely long. The curve is also self-similar, made up of smaller copies of itself.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_49" id="ttf_12a_49">49</a></sup> Magnify any segment and you will see the same pattern, replicated in infinitely smaller scale.</p>

<p id="pz157-6">The French-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot has demonstrated that fractals occur in many places, not only in mathematics but in nature.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_50" id="ttf_12a_50">50</a></sup> Fractals demonstrate a degree of order in chaos and can be used to describe the shape of irregular objects and surfaces that still evidence some pattern, such as snowflakes, cauliflower, coral, ferns, trees, and lightning. They have also been applied to everything from ocean waves to geologic fault lines, and from blood and lung vasculature to chaos theory. Mandelbrot’s work points out that “clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_51" id="ttf_12a_51">51</a></sup> Generations of mathematicians set aside such shapes as “formless.” But this shortsightedness only betrayed Euclidean geometry’s inability to describe them with any accuracy. Fractals explain how it is that these natural phenomena, for all their irregularity (or “roughness”), are not purely chaotic but are in fact only complex.</p>
<p id="pz157-7">Fractal dimensionality has also been applied to the study of human art, architecture, music, and more. Important to our application is the underlying idea that the repetition of a simple base formula produces extraordinary complexity.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_52" id="ttf_12a_52">52</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz157-8">How might we apply this analogously to the organization of systematic theology? Two words of caution are in order. We should be clear that this is only an analogy: my suggestion is not that mathematics directs either the form or the content of dogmatics—that would be a most horrific expression of natural theology—but only that fractals provide a useful depiction of conceptual complexity that may be applied to the organization of doctrines. “Starting point” and “center,” like Euclidean geometry, are not sufficiently capable of describing the challenge at hand. Second, we ought to honor Barth’s warning to resist systems as the imposition of controlling principles other than the Word of God (especially when those principles are drawn from a sphere outside of dogmatics). To force one’s theology into any such pattern—even one as complex and pliable as fractal geometry—is to succumb to the temptation of self-will and so lose dogmatics’ necessary orientation to the Word of God. “Systematization,” said Barth, “is always the enemy of true theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_53" id="ttf_12a_53">53</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz157-9">With these cautions at hand let us consider how a fractal model allows us to reconfigure the relationship between Trinity and Christology. According <span id="z158-6">to Mandelbrot the most useful fractals involve three crucial things: <i>chance</i> (which produces irregularities), <i>scaling</i> (the degree of their irregularity is identical at all scales), and <i>dimension</i> (shapes grow increasingly complex with each iteration).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_54" id="ttf_12a_54">54</a></sup> In a theological application, dimension should reflect the doctrine of the Trinity, the whole that is perceived with increasing complexity as it is reiterated through the topics of God, creation, reconciliation, and redemption. These aspects of presentation will never accumulate to a finished or complete understanding of God, just as the fractal need not conclude with any particular iteration.</span></p>
<p id="pz158-7">Scaling best reflects the proper role of Christology in dogmatics. This is the shape that each iteration takes, the geometric pattern (one arm of the snowflake) that is repeated throughout all doctrinal topics and which remains the same both in macrocosm (Christology proper) and in microcosm (the christological shape of other doctrines). This pattern does not insist upon matters of anthropology or sin or the church, as though they themselves are merely repetitions of Christology proper, or reducible to it. But it does provide that all things—<i>all</i> things—are normed by Jesus’s person and work.</p>
<p id="pz158-8">Mandelbrot’s notion of chance is more difficult to apply, but we should avoid the temptation to map it onto either the Holy Spirit and Pneumatology or (<i>pace</i> Schleiermacher) the individual’s subjective religious experience. In fractal geometry, chance retains a chaotic element: although chaos indicates a certain degree of pattern, it is not wholly predictable or explainable. Perhaps the best place we can take this in our theological analogy is to Barth’s dialectical understanding of the Word of God. This Word at the center of dogmatics is invisible, self-positing, and irreducible, so that the theologian in her work cannot presume mastery of it but only bear witness to it. God in Jesus Christ is at once both veiled and unveiled to creaturely eyes. Like the notion of chance, this sort of reasoning unsettles our attempts to control the object of theological inquiry, for God’s self-communication is “permanently disorienting.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_55" id="ttf_12a_55">55</a></sup> Hence the theologian is called upon to “renounce the attempt to usurp a kind of transcendent vantage point,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_56" id="ttf_12a_56">56</a></sup> to acknowledge her lack of knowing and fall silent in the face of the divine mystery.</p>
<p id="pz159-6">We may summarize the results of our application in this way: Dogmatics is properly Trinitarian in its <i>object</i> and christological in its <i>pattern</i> or shape. Per Webster the doctrine of God is seen in the Koch snowflake’s finite area, which is the definite whole of the theological enterprise. All matters pertain to God and God’s works, <i>ad intra</i> and <i>ad extra</i>. And, per Barth, the doctrine of Jesus Christ is the snowflake’s infinite line, the pattern of which is repeated at all points and in infinite scale. No element of Christian teaching is explained sufficiently without decisive reference to Jesus and the revelation of God in him. These two—Trinity and Christology—are not in conflict with one another, nor do they simply address different subject matters. There is no measurable area without the boundary line (<i>ordo cognoscendi</i>), nor does the line’s existence fail to produce a discernable shape (<i>ordo essendi</i>).</p>
<p id="pz159-7">I conclude briefly with two advantages that the fractal model may provide. First, as just stated, the model illustrates that the relationship between certain doctrines in the Christian presentation—I have focused here on Trinity and Christology—is noncompetitive. Linear models suggest an ineluctable privilege to that which comes first and, in some cases, to what comes last as theology’s sum and telos. Geometric models also privilege one doctrine as the “center” around which all other topics are oriented. Attempts to complicate this with the image of an ellipsis with two foci are only self-encumbered. Both foci cannot be determinative of the whole; even the theologian cannot serve two masters (Matt 6:24)!<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_57" id="ttf_12a_57">57</a></sup> In practice both models end up reductive to greater or lesser degrees. But the fractal analogy is sufficiently complex to accommodate the multidimensionality of the network of doctrines in systematic theology, including their movement (or iteration), their patterned replication, and their mutual referentiality.</p>
<p id="pz159-8">Against the trend of modern theology, the doctrines of Trinity and Christology should be thought together, considered in their organic interrelatedness.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_58" id="ttf_12a_58">58</a></sup> But the point at which one enters this system could be anywhere, <span id="z160-6">and so long as these two receive their proper due, the order of one’s treatment could vary radically (no two snowflakes being quite the same).</span></p>
<p id="pz160-7">Second, depicting the arrangement of doctrines with a fractal model has at least the potential to render dogmatics more ready for cross-cultural and interdisciplinary uses—two places where “doctrine” and “dogmatics” are often regarded as (usually antiquated) conceptual tools, if they are not avoided altogether. The model accounts for the more practical realities that stem from the fact that Christian dogmatics is neither linear nor geometric in nature. The scale and symmetry of the fractal picture can accommodate not only different doctrinal emphases and orders of treatment but also diverse cultural conditions and applications. It has at least the potential to diffuse tensions between dogmatics and other theologically minded concerns and subdisciplines. It might even display a new friendliness toward other disciplines, such as philosophy or the study of religions, by allowing scholars space to affirm the integrity of their own pursuits with a certain calmness. In practice, then, the model might embolden a more “theological” theology.</p>
<h2 id="pz160-8">C<span class="smallcaps" id="Aios">ONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz160-9">“As a whole,” Barth said, “i.e., in the basic statements of a church dogmatics, Christology must either be dominant and perceptible, or else it is not Christology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_59" id="ttf_12a_59">59</a></sup> Either dogmatics will orient itself wholly and at every point to Jesus Christ in his particularity, or it will find itself unable to speak about him effectively. John Webster affirmed this but, rather than ordering all things to Christology, he ordered Christology and all things to the doctrine of God. The proposal I have outlined here attempts to retain Barth’s insight while accommodating a multiplicity of starting points and, with Webster, acknowledge that theological speech has the triune life of God as its subject and source. The exercise of Christocentric reasoning does not dilute the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity; in fact it depends upon it.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_60" id="ttf_12a_60">60</a></sup> Geoffrey Bromiley’s statement that for Barth the centrality of Christ is meant “to point to (and not away from) the centrality of the triune God”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_61" id="ttf_12a_61">61</a></sup> here may be affirmed and also reversed: the Christian doctrine of God properly works itself out in a christological form. This is expressive <span id="z161-6">of the fact that neither the doctrine of the Trinity nor Christology may be explicated without the other.</span></p>
<p id="pz161-7">I wonder, though, if it is Christology that provides the ground and soil for a full accounting of the triunity of God, rather than the other way around (especially given the history of the articulation of these doctrines from the first through the fourth centuries). Webster’s ordering of Trinity-then-Christology of course makes a great deal of analytical sense, not least because the person of the Son is <i>one</i> of the Trinity and not the totality of the triune God. But it is less obvious from the point of view of the history of dogma, where expressions of God’s triune nature largely have followed from affirmations about Jesus Christ. This need not be decisive for anything other than the <i>ordo cognoscendi</i>, and probably should not be so; “Is Jesus divine because God is three, or is God three because Jesus too is divine?” is without a doubt the wrong sort of question to ask. But if Barth is right in his critique of classical metaphysics, and particularly of the prioritizing of being over act, the analytical judgments which lead to Trinity-then-Christology at least become less obviously true.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_62" id="ttf_12a_62">62</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz161-8">This is meant only as a tentative judgment, a defense of the ongoing relevance not simply of Christocentrism in general but of the specific sort of Christocentrism practiced by Barth—one that is capacious in its extension beyond the more ordinary explanations of preexistence and incarnation. And this judgment is certainly not to dismiss the dogmatic priority of the doctrine of God (as the above proposal makes clear). Trinity and Christology remain equally basic in the methods of theological exposition. Barth reminds us that the theologian cannot proclaim an authentically Christian theology without returning to the living Word of God as its pattern and norm. And Webster reminds us of whom we speak when we do this: the triune God from whom all things are, in whom “we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Theology is concerned with this God and his works, and an unflinching Christocentrism shows us this God as he truly is.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_12a_63" id="ttf_12a_63">63</a></sup></p>

Not only are naturalist approaches to Jesus Christ odious to the balance of theology and economy, but attempts to counter such approaches have often produced the same result in a different form. Here Webster cites the Christologies of Isaak Dorner (whose imbalance he says favors the order of knowing) and Albrecht Ritschl (who collapses Christology into soteriology and religious fellowship). He concludes that Karl Barth, however, overcame these things by maintaining a consistent and powerful attention to the economy while yet refusing to allow theology to atrophy (Ibid., 54–57).</span></p>

Thus, they do not come before or float free from the material of theology, nor (as in Barth’s worry about “principles” and “systems”) do they create the conditions for the deduction of Christian teaching in abstraction from Holy Scripture.</span></p>

The gravitational pull of the latter proved so great, in Barth’s judgment, that the former finally collapsed into it and proved unnecessary to the system. See Barth, <i>Protestant Theology in the Nineteenth Century</i> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002), 443–59.

It may be noted, however, that Webster too believed that the metaphysics of classical “theism” render inconceivable an ontological unity between God and humanity in the incarnation. This is because theism fills out the terms <i>theos</i> and <i>Christos</i> without reference to one another, leaving the doctrine of incarnation unworkable.
