<h2 id="pASUT">I<span class="smallcaps" id="ANVn">NTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pA5y">An essay on the “task of dogmatics” is not usually something a New Testament scholar would be invited to write. Surely this is a subject best left to the systematic theologians among us, whose job it is to explicate theological themes, their purposes and interrelationship. New Testament <span id="z88-6">specialists, on the other hand, are supposed to be concerned with historical matters, with the social, cultural, and religious particularity of this or that text, with the grammatical and lexical questions surrounding the translation of given sentences, and so on. Dogmatics requires a different skill set, different interlocutors, <i>different books</i>. What is more, the thought that a New Testament specialist, like myself, might have something to add to a conversation about dogmatics might be frowned upon by other members within my own guild. New Testament scholars are meant to proceed on the basis of public (if not objective) methods which are neutral with regards to faith commitments articulated in terms of dogmas. I am delighted to write this essay, however, for on the contrary I believe that one of the most pressing needs for biblical studies is to relearn theological literacy, to open doors of communication with dogmaticians, and I hope that the following will facilitate these kinds of conversations. First and to this end, I focus on the apostle Paul with half an eye on questions relating to the task of dogmatics. Second, I will highlight a key moment in the theological tradition that has captured this Pauline set of concerns. Third, these two sections will enable us critically to engage some modern trends in systematic theology, trends that arguably need to reexamine Paul’s insights.</span></p>

<p class="noind" id="pz88-9">To explicate what one could call the task of dogmatics within Paul’s theological idiom, I turn to a rather curious and complex argument in the middle of his second longest letter, 1 Corinthians. This passage is usually mined, simply, for the low-hanging fruit of 1 Corinthians 8:6, which has been called a christological redefinition of Jewish monotheism.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_2" id="ttf_10_2">2</a></sup> But this verse is part of an explicitly epistemological argument, which we must address in order to clarify matters relating to purpose and the language of “task.”</p>
<p id="pz88-10">The situation concerns certain Corinthian Christ-followers who want to enjoy food offered to idols in the temple precincts. This was not just about enjoying a more varied menu, but offered opportunities for striking up business deals and pursuing financial contacts. Wanting to justify participation in these idol-honouring feasts, for to be absent would be a bad business move, certain Corinthian Christians offered theological rationale. <span id="z89-6">Schrage reconstructs their position as follows: “We have the authority to eat meat offered to idols because we all have knowledge and know there are no idols in the world and there is no God apart from one.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_3" id="ttf_10_3">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz89-7">As Volker Gäckle has maintained in a deeply learned study on the “strong” and the “weak” in Corinth and Rome, these Corinthians are to be characterized as intellectual snobs (on the basis of their own words embedded within Paul’s argumentation). An “aristocratic consciousness shines through,” Gäckle argues in comment on 1 Corinthians 8:1, “one grounded on <i>an intellectualized knowledge of the world and God.</i>”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_4" id="ttf_10_4">4</a></sup> These Christians looked upon the “weak” as those with a “cognitive-rational deficit,” hence the posture of their grasp of knowledge is to be understood in terms of intellectualized, rationalistic discourse.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_5" id="ttf_10_5">5</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz89-8">As Paul explains beginning in 8:7, their position, and the consequently justified practices, were causing harm to other Christians. It seems that other church members saw these “knowledgeable” Christians going into the idol temple to eat food offered to the various gods, and were then led to go and join them. But these “weak” Christians, not knowing what the Corinthian knowledgeable knew, could only participate in such feasts in a way that meant unambiguous idol worship. In so doing, these weak brothers were “destroyed.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_6" id="ttf_10_6">6</a></sup> So the theological justifications of the “knowledgeable” became “a stumbling block to the weak” to such an extent that their existence as Christians was jeopardized (1 Cor 8:9).</p>
<p id="pz89-9">But before Paul explains the problem of the Corinthian position in terms of its impact on other Christian brothers and sisters, he first makes an <i>epistemological</i> argument. This appears at the beginning of this section, in 8:1–7, and we will spend some time grappling with this now, for it speaks into our questions about the task of dogmatics.</p>
<p id="pz89-10">Although this passage contains numerous puzzles that I cannot address today, I hope to steer a course around many of the choppy waters by leaning on conclusions that I and others have already drawn elsewhere. In particular, I will assume (with the majority), rather than defend, the presence <span id="z90-6">of citations of Paul’s Corinthian interlocutors in 1 Corinthians 8, and I will assume, rather than defend, that these citations include only “all of us possess knowledge” (8:1), “no idol in the world really exists,” and “there is no God but one” (8:4).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_7" id="ttf_10_7">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz90-7">Let us turn to the text.</p>
<p class="line3"/>
<p class="center" id="pz90-8">1 C<span class="smallcaps" id="AD7o">ORINTHIANS</span> 8:1–7</p> 
<blockquote id="A5Rk9">

<blockquote> 
<p class="blo3a" id="pz90-10">Περὶ δὲ τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων (8:1–3)</p>
<p class="blo3" id="pz90-11"><sup>1</sup> Now concerning food offered to idols:</p>

<p class="blo3" id="pz90-13">(P<sub>1</sub>) Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. <sup>2</sup> Anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge (δει γνωναι); <sup>3</sup> but anyone who loves God is known by him.</p> 

<p class="blo3a" id="pz90-16"><span id="Aqqx"/>Περὶ τῆς βρώσεως οὖν τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων (8:4–6)</p>
<p class="blo3" id="pz90-17"><sup>4</sup> Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols:</p>
<p class="blo3" id="pz90-18">(C<sub>2</sub>) we know that (1) “no idol in the world really exists,” and (2) that “there is no God but one.”</p>
<p class="blo3" id="pz90-20">(P<sub>2</sub>) <sup>5</sup> Indeed, even though there may be so-called (λεγόμενοι) gods in heaven or on earth as in fact there are many gods and many lords<span id="pz91-6"/>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="blo" id="pz91-7"><sup>7</sup> It is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p class="line3a"/>

<p id="pz91-8">Crucially, 1 Corinthians 8:1–3 provides the hermeneutical and epistemological key for Paul’s forthcoming argument. He begins by stating the broad issue: “now concerning food offered to idols” (περὶ δὲ τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων). Paul then immediately creates a contrast that structures much of what follows, marked by C<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>1</sub>:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz91-9"><p class="blo">(C<sub>1</sub>) “we know that ‘all of us possess knowledge’ ” (as the Corinthian ‘knowledgeable’ say)</p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz91-11">So Paul responds,</p> 
<blockquote id="pz91-12"><p class="blo">(P<sub>1</sub>) “Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. Anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowing (δεῖ γνῶναι); but anyone who loves God is known by him.”</p> </blockquote>
<p id="pz91-13">Two points merit attention. First, whereas the Corinthian “strong”—or better, “knowledgeable”—claim to have knowledge as a possession (γνῶσιν ἔχομεν), Paul is clear that this kind of knowledge puffs up; it is knowledge that only <i>claims</i> “to know something.” But note that Paul is not simply anti-intellectual, for he speaks of “necessary knowing (δεῖ γνῶναι)” in his contrasting claim. It is a particular way of knowing that Paul contradicts.</p>
<p id="pz91-14">Second, over and against the type of knowing that claims to have knowledge as its possession, Paul articulates what could be called a relational,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_8" id="ttf_10_8">8</a></sup> <span id="z92-6">covenantal way of knowing: one spoken in terms of the knowledge God has of us and, reciprocally, one expressed in terms of our love of God. This case understands the clauses in 8:2 and 8:3 to interpret one another. The repetition of the verb γινώσκω suggests that the “necessary knowing” in 8:2 is expounded as loving God and being known by him in 8:3. To “be known by God” connotes <i>God’s special, covenantal relationship with his chosen people</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_9" id="ttf_10_9">9</a></sup> As Amos 3:2 says, “You only have I known (ἔγνων) of all the families of the earth.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_10" id="ttf_10_10">10</a></sup> Eric Waaler, therefore, concludes his study with the claim that Paul’s language here of loving God and being known by him “describes the personal relationship between the believer and God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_11" id="ttf_10_11">11</a></sup> As Jewish scholar Jon Levenson recently argued in his delightful study on the love of God, “If we are to employ the term ‘monotheism’, long used to describe Judaism, the only meaning the term can have within the specific context of covenant is in reference to this rigorous exclusivity of relationship.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_12" id="ttf_10_12">12</a></sup> This is why Paul couples the language of being known by God, which connotes God’s covenantal relationship with his people, with talk of loving God. Within Paul’s idiom, covenantal knowledge of and love for God necessarily go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p id="pz92-7">In sum, then, Paul’s “necessary knowing” is a knowledge of God understood in terms of covenant, relationship, and love for God. Thus, it is not a possession, contra the claim of the Corinthian “knowledgeable.” Instead, it is God’s knowledge of his people. And this provides the epistemological and hermeneutical key for the rest of Paul’s argument.</p>
<p id="pz92-8">Indeed, Paul is explicit that the opening three verses should be understood as framing his continued argument,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_13" id="ttf_10_13">13</a></sup> and this takes place as 8:4–6 repeats and elaborates the contrast established in 8:1–3. First, Paul cites the <i>content</i> of the Corinthian “knowledge” in 8:4, and it involves two propositions:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz93-6"><p class="blo">(C<sub>2</sub>) we know that (1) “no idol in the world really exists,” and that (2) “there is no God but one.”</p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz93-7">This is the knowledge used to justify their attendance at feasts in idol temples. After all, if there is no idol and no God but one, why worry about those nonexistent gods? “Let’s go and enjoy the idol food because we know better.”</p>
<p id="pz93-8">Paul responds to claims (1) and (2) in what follows: P<sub>2</sub>, beginning in 8:5, is a qualified concession to claim (1) in C<sub>2</sub> that no idol really exists. Paul’s point appears to be that they don’t exist <i>as real divine beings</i>. Hence, he writes, in 8:5 in a tone of agreement (“indeed” translating εἴπερ), that there are “so-called” (λεγόμενοι) gods, and only as such exist, that is, only as nongods are there many gods and lords.</p>
<p id="pz93-9">But it is likely that this is already what Schnabel has called a “differentiated understanding” of the claims of the Corinthian “knowledgeable.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_14" id="ttf_10_14">14</a></sup> This is why I suggest that the correction of the Corinthian position begins in 8:5.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_15" id="ttf_10_15">15</a></sup> It continues in 8:6: “but for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.” Corresponding with the mentioned love for God in 8:2 (in P<sub>1</sub>), Paul reuses the words of the <i>shema</i> in 8:6, as is now well known, and does so by dividing the Lord and the God of the <i>shema</i> between God and Jesus.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_16" id="ttf_10_16">16</a></sup> But this is to be expected if one remembers the way the argument was set up in 8:1–3. In a context which expresses a Corinthian knowledge of the one God, Paul corrects this by pointing to the love-for-God-orientated nature of true knowing. And the clearest articulation of such relational knowing of the one God in the Scriptures of Israel is, of course, the <i>shema</i>. “Hear, O Israel: YHWH our God, YHWH is one. You shall love YHWH your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might (Deut 6:4–5).” As McConville argues, Deuteronomy “always thinks of God’s oneness in relational terms, <span id="z94-6">that is, in the context of his relationship with Israel.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_17" id="ttf_10_17">17</a></sup> Likewise, as Moberly argues, the Deuteronomic <i>shema</i> language of oneness, <i>’ekhad</i>, expresses that “YHWH is the one and only <i>for Israel</i>,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_18" id="ttf_10_18">18</a></sup> and so goes on to speak of the command to “love the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD</span> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” in the next verse (Deut 6:5). So Paul can press his point now, highlighting what is inherent in the <i>shema</i>, by packing 8:6 with relational terms: “but <i>for us</i>,” “<i>for</i> and <i>from</i> whom <i>we</i> exist,” “Father,” and “Lord.” In contradistinction to the Corinthian knowledge that “there is no God but one,” Paul emphasises the relational. Though presenting propositional truth in 8:4, the Corinthians would fail entirely if the issue remained abstract, if they didn’t grasp matters relationally.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_19" id="ttf_10_19">19</a></sup> It is this relational, participatory knowledge that not all have (8:7).</span></p>
<p id="pz94-7">It is time to sum up our argument so far. What we see in 1 Corinthians 8:1–7 is a discussion relating to ways of engaging with theological propositions. Although what the Corinthians stated was true enough at a pure, naked, propositional level, it was judged negatively by Paul. Their knowledge puffed up and was a false claim to know something. The startling upshot is that <i>the confession of true propositions can, when this relational context is subdued, nullify the presence of any knowledge at all</i>. So Paul is not anti-intellectual, but rather aims for a knowing he calls “necessary,” one rooted in the covenantal and relational reality of being known by God.</p>
<p id="pz94-8">It follows that good readings of Paul don’t simply look at the edifice of Paul’s theology from a distance and admire the whole as if it were something “over there.” As we have seen, we best read Paul by approaching up close and personal, climbing through a window to see the whole from <i>within</i>. In this chapter, I am attempting to facilitate just this, with 1 Corinthians 8:1–7 providing an entrance point. From this vantage point, I will now briefly cast our eyes more widely to behold the way in which these claims about Paul sit next to other major themes. Without wanting to discourse on Paul’s epistemology as a whole, it suffices to offer our analysis of 1 Corinthians 8 a broader grammar in two points for reasons that will become clear in the next sections.</p>
<p id="pz94-9">First, if one tracks with the rest of Paul’s argument about idol food, up to 1 Corinthians 11:1, it becomes clear that this love-towards-God-knowing <span id="z95-6">is expressed in terms of love for others. It is a relational knowing that is embodied in real life and relationships, as well as in the rejection of idolatry.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_20" id="ttf_10_20">20</a></sup> We also see in the rest of the argument that it is a knowing expressed, as I have argued elsewhere, most consistently in terms of loyalty to and relationship with the risen Lord over against idolatry. This Christ-relation is Paul’s divine Christology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_21" id="ttf_10_21">21</a></sup> It is a way of knowing that isn’t prior to but indeed <i>is</i> discipleship.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_22" id="ttf_10_22">22</a></sup> It is, to use Mary Healy’s turn of phrase, knowledge expressed as relationship.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_23" id="ttf_10_23">23</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz95-7">Second, and looking more broadly across Paul’s letters, we see repeated the theme that, for Paul, the knowledge of God is not something one strictly possesses. It is better to speak of God’s knowledge of us. Likewise, just a few chapters later in 1 Corinthians, Paul admits that “now I know only in part” and “I will know fully, even as I have been fully known” only when seeing face to face (πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον, 13:12). This πρόσωπον language indicates the desired eschatological encounter with the living Lord, which Paul speaks of in numerous other places.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_24" id="ttf_10_24">24</a></sup> “For while we are at home in the body,” as he puts it in 2 Corinthians, “we are away from the Lord” and so “we walk by faith, not by sight” (2 Cor 5:6–7). Knowledge, then, is eschatologically determined and christologically permeated, all parsed according to the grammar of faith, hope, and love.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_25" id="ttf_10_25">25</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz95-8">This should not be taken to imply that Paul’s epistemology is embarrassed by the notion that sentences can be truth-bearers. Paul himself makes plenty of sentences involving “claims that things are such and such and so not their contradictories,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_26" id="ttf_10_26">26</a></sup> to use the language of Colin Gunton.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_27" id="ttf_10_27">27</a></sup> <span id="z96-6">Without wanting to enter the complex arena of debates concerning theories of truth, it seems safe at least to think Paul resists the reduction of the truth of a sentence about God to its correspondence with facts about God. For Paul, the knowledge of God is not possessed, mastered, and treated as formula external to the graced knower, but is a part of that subject’s life and interpersonal relations. To what extent this means Paul can be seen to instantiate a pragmatic or subjective theory of truth at this point is one I cannot address in this essay. What we can say simply is that to be known by God involves, for Paul, speech embedded in lives of worship and in the rejection of idolatry; knowledge is expressed in sentences which gain their meaning in terms of that muddy network of ground-level relationships in which disciples live.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_28" id="ttf_10_28">28</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz96-7">“Abstract,” a word I have deployed already at various points, can now be specified more closely. An “abstraction,” in Pauline hue, indicates a concept that is deployed and understood as if discipleship was not essential to the appropriation of its meaning and the reception of its articulation, existing merely as a transcendent thought or idea, claiming its theological veracity only in terms of its correspondence with naked facts. It follows from this that it names the kind of rhetoric in which one claims to represent a universal truth by means of a concept, irrespective of the particularity of the life of the graced knower or the historical events that have served to communicate that truth to us.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_29" id="ttf_10_29">29</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz96-8">Armed with these realisations, we are poised to comment on the task of dogmatics in contemporary theological discourse.</p>
<h2 id="pz96-9">P<span class="smallcaps" id="APLX">AUL</span>, T<span class="smallcaps" id="AxQH">HE</span> T<span class="smallcaps" id="AElW">ASK OF</span> D<span class="smallcaps" id="AvFn">OGMATICS</span>, <span class="smallcaps" id="AUug">AND</span> “B<span class="smallcaps" id="AaWk">ARTHIAN</span>” T<span class="smallcaps" id="ANaP">HEOLOGY</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz96-10">The spirit of Pauline God-talk seems to have found particularly vigorous representation and extension in modern theological trends influenced by Karl Barth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_30" id="ttf_10_30">30</a></sup> Tracing these similarities with and developments beyond Paul will help us engage with rather different fashions more critically.</p>
<p id="pz96-11">Now even a superficial reading of Barth can see how he resisted abstract <span id="z97-6">or general language in the theological enterprise, and that this involved a simultaneous emphasis on the personal nature of revelation. So Barth means, by revelation, “a concrete relation to concrete men,” something that is, as Kevin Diller describes, “fundamentally personal.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_31" id="ttf_10_31">31</a></sup> God is not known from a distance, nor in general terms, for Barth, but in the actuality of our personal transformation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_32" id="ttf_10_32">32</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz97-7">For Barth, the criterion and possibility of dogmatics, namely the Word, is described in <i>CD</i> I/1 in personal terms. But because revelation happens—God does not merely try to reveal himself—we can speak of the Word of God as a “success-Word.” So the human response is included in the Word of God such that revelation is not simply “over there,” but includes “the entire correspondence on man’s side to the divine act of revelation” which is “just as seriously the content of the biblical witness to revelation as is the objective reality of revelation” (<i>CD</i> I/2, 206). This means that the personal Word becomes a relational or a participatory one. Similarly, in 1 Thessalonians 2:13, Paul gives thanks because “when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God’s word, which is also at work in you believers” (NRSV). Barth famously gives this reasoning a strong christological under-girding, which means that we can speak of the particularity of theological rhetoric both in terms of human faith and repentance, and in terms of its concrete reference to the man Jesus Christ. Indeed, these are two sides of the same coin, for Christ is the time in which we live as agents—Christ is God’s time for us.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_33" id="ttf_10_33">33</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz97-8">It indeed follows from all this that theological description will always be provisional, and never “an end in itself,” to cite Alan Torrance.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_34" id="ttf_10_34">34</a></sup> As Kevin Diller puts it in commentary on Barth, “individual propositional expressions in human language do not have the power to contain the Truth.” Second-order reflections can only be “derivative of and dependent on the actual knowing relation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_35" id="ttf_10_35">35</a></sup> As such the task of theological knowledge is understood <span id="z98-6">in terms of that wider relational, christological, and eschatological grammar of faith, obedience, and repentance that we saw exemplified in Paul.</span></p>
<p id="pz98-7">Much of what animates Barth here could as well be direct commentary on 1 Corinthians 8:1–7. And Barth manages this precisely as he engages the topic of theological epistemology situated within a different conceptual milieu. Hence “Barthian” theology wrestled with the issue of the knowledge of God in a context that foregrounded questions such as the conditions, possibility, and validation of the knowledge of God—in other words, all the issues that have been unavoidable since Kant’s separation of the <i>Ding an sich</i> from the realm of rational knowledge.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_36" id="ttf_10_36">36</a></sup> Such issues were not driving Paul’s agenda at all, but Barth has preserved the Pauline grammar to address and subvert these different sets of issues, and in so doing necessarily extends and looks beyond Paul. The task of dogmatics could hardly be exemplified more constructively.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz98-10">However, although all of this is heartening for a New Testament scholar such as myself, I have noticed different trends in theological circles in the last decade. Quite simply, they do not give weight to the lessons explored so profoundly in Barth’s corpus. Put sharply, I suggest that insecure and abstract γνῶσις is again being taken to condition the reality of God in our God-talk, derailing the task of dogmatics from its relational and participatory tracks.</p>
<p id="pz98-11">Let me immediately make clear that in what follows I do not wish to take aim at metaphysics, speculation, or philosophically minded theological rhetoric per se, any more than Paul rejected the intellect as such. Likewise, Barth did not reject philosophy per se; rather, he rejected the way it could operate in theological discourse as a putative (and illegitimate) foundation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_37" id="ttf_10_37">37</a></sup> Instead, my target is abstract thinking that is then taken to <i>condition</i> God-talk, that is, constructions that are used to <i>govern</i> what can and must be said about God.</p>
<p id="pz98-12">The two examples of this, which I turn to examine now, are outstanding scholars both of whom have been brilliant keynote speakers at the very event <span id="z99-6">behind this book, the LA Theology Conference. I am speaking of Steve Holmes and Katherine Sonderegger. So please let me begin by stating in clearest terms that I do not wish to suggest that either of their theological projects are wholly problematic! Indeed, I have learnt from and enjoy both important scholars. Sonderegger’s chapter in this very book is, indeed, one of the finest dogmatic expositions of Scripture I have ever read! I simply want to critique aspects of their otherwise learned scholarly contributions, to further some important conversations that need to take place.</span></p>
<p id="pz99-7">First, to Sonderegger. If the apostle Paul claims that the knowledge of God is bound up in loving God and others within the ambit of God’s covenantal knowledge of his own, and as such cannot be a possession or abstraction, then I see a different direction in Sonderegger’s work, at least in the first couple of chapters of her <i>Systematic Theology</i>. There I see the imposition of nonrelational, abstract knowledge that is then taken to govern her engagement with Scripture and the content of some key theological claims.</p>
<p id="pz99-8">In these first couple of chapters she presses the distinction between the who and what of God, and between (scriptural) narrative and metaphysics. Although Sonderegger claims that Scripture does not present us with detailed metaphysics, such questions can and must still be asked (here we agree!). She cites Barth’s claim that we “must learn to see beyond Paul,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_38" id="ttf_10_38">38</a></sup> as legitimation of this kind of engagement with Scripture, to look beyond the “genre” of Scripture to its subject matter, which she takes to indicate the (metaphysical) oneness of God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_39" id="ttf_10_39">39</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz99-9">Although she is aware that Scripture does not present this oneness as a “ ‘metaphysical analysis’ of Divine Nature,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_40" id="ttf_10_40">40</a></sup> we “must go further” because “in the end, Holy Scripture reveals to us what kind of Being God is: Divine Oneness, we must say, is a metaphysical predicate,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_41" id="ttf_10_41">41</a></sup> and only recognition of this aspect of engaging Scripture can amount to a “proper theological reading.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_42" id="ttf_10_42">42</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz99-10">The problem Sonderegger identifies is that in the world of Barth and others, such metaphysical oneness is threatened by the narrative focus on divine threeness. She notes the resistance of others to begin with a “ ‘naked’ <span id="z100-6">doctrine of God—a God considered apart from or prior to Trinity.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_43" id="ttf_10_43">43</a></sup> Instead, Sonderegger appeals to the oneness of God as the first step in her task, one which “is recommended principally by Holy Scripture itself.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_44" id="ttf_10_44">44</a></sup> Indeed, as such, Sonderegger claims that her <i>Systematic Theology</i> is “biblical theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_45" id="ttf_10_45">45</a></sup> This leads to her exegesis of Deuteronomy 4:10–14, which speaks of the way God hid his form from Moses. For Sonderegger, this bespeaks God’s invisibility and thus dovetails with the metaphysics of the “Divine Nature as One.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_46" id="ttf_10_46">46</a></sup> She concludes that “the True God of Judaism and the church is marked off from the false by invisibility: the nature of the One God is to have no image, form, or likeness.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_47" id="ttf_10_47">47</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz100-7">But my concern with all of this, and it is not an insignificant one, is that Sonderegger begins her <i>Systematics</i> by deploying a <i>governing</i> metaphysically abstract concept. I speak of “abstraction” here given the way Sonderegger coordinates oneness with invisibility, and because of her description of it as a metaphysical predicate, which speaks of the “Whatness” of God.</p>
<p id="pz100-8">In contrast to this, Pauline knowing has a double particularity, both by being bound to the name Jesus Christ and to the relational or participatory nature of necessary knowing.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_48" id="ttf_10_48">48</a></sup> Indeed, although he does not directly correct the Corinthian language of “oneness,” he puts it on the wrong side of his contrasts because it was framed wrongly. Oneness, parsed in Sonderegger’s terms, appears to be just brute theological fact. Discipleship, the knower’s love for God, and love for others are not a <i>necessary</i> part of this dynamic, and that is troubling for readers of Paul. After all, Sonderegger is explicit that her task is to discourse on oneness as a concept <i>before</i> engaging the Trinity. If the Trinity involves the articulation of the grammar of God’s saving <i>relationship</i> with humans, it follows that “oneness” is construed apart from and before God’s knowledge of us. So Paul, responding to the brute fact of the Corinthian knowledgeable, explicitly articulated his God-talk in relational terms, which was, after all, to capture the spirit of the <i>shema</i> itself.</p>
<p id="pz100-9">So does Sonderegger’s emphasis on conceptual abstraction in the core claims in her first chapters correspond well with Paul’s necessary knowing? For the apostle, knowing does not take place when its (necessary) theological propositions merely discuss what is “over there” irrespective of the <span id="z101-6">placement of these propositions in the grammar of love for God and others. My worry is that despite the wonderfully devotional <i>style</i> of Sonderegger’s rhetoric, the <i>content</i> of her theological claims can too easily land on the wrong side of Paul’s contrasts in 1 Corinthians 8.</span></p>
<p id="pz101-7">Of course, Sonderegger does this because she sees the theological task bound to her construal of metaphysics. But perhaps this underestimates the eschatological and therefore provisional nature of abstract dogmatic terms. It seems to me that she absolutises an abstract concept and calls this the subject matter of Scripture, which not only pays too little attention in expression to the relational but also puts too much weight on that abstraction. It is creaking under the eschatological pressure Paul’s language of knowing in part expresses—until we see face-to-face. So I am certainly not suggesting that God is not one or that theology cannot articulate this as central to its project—of course not. It is, rather, to cast doubt on <i>how</i> these issues are articulated, by means of both the kinds of themes which coordinate them and the function they perform (here the abstract concept of oneness <i>governs</i> her God-talk).</p>
<p id="pz101-8">All of this has exegetical ramifications. In the first place, I think Sonderegger underestimates the metaphysical content of Scripture itself, so making space to push through another. Scripture’s own metaphysic of oneness insists that recognition of God as one cannot be separated from loving commitment to God. In a chapter entitled “So Love Yahweh, Your God: ‘Monotheism’ as Devoted Love,” Hebrew Bible scholar Nathan MacDonald notes that while in modern intellectualised definitions “ ‘monotheism’ is a truth to be comprehended,” in Deuteronomy, it is “a relationship in which to be committed.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_49" id="ttf_10_49">49</a></sup> This oneness of God, MacDonald reminds us in a way that dovetails neatly with our comments about Paul’s theological epistemology, “<i>cannot be abstracted from the relationship between YHWH and Israel</i>.” Scripture speaks “about the nature of YHWH, [offering] <i>an ontological statement</i>, <i>so to speak</i>, but a statement that cannot be divorced from [God’s] personal claim on Israel.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_50" id="ttf_10_50">50</a></sup> Indeed. Here we see aspects of Scripture’s metaphysic and ontology.</p>
<p id="pz101-9">But has not this scriptural idiom, which respects the historical particularity of these texts precisely on the issue of God’s oneness, been subdued by the imposition of only one kind of metaphysically orientated concept of oneness? Almost every attempt of a theologian to pull a metaphysical construct over Scripture is the flip side of underestimating the metaphysical <span id="z102-6">dynamics proffered in Scripture itself. It is just that Scripture’s metaphysic, with its profoundly relational epistemology (and ontology, as we are beginning to see), is often not recognised, so it is ignored and a vacuum is created. Inevitably, Scripture is then dealt with only in a piecemeal manner.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_51" id="ttf_10_51">51</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz102-7">Is not this why Sonderegger can claim, in her exegesis, that God’s oneness is most obviously linked to the theme of invisibility? Not only are these two concepts voiced less than one might imagine in Scripture, they are not explicitly correlated in these terms anywhere in the canon. What is more, in claiming that invisibility is what marks off God from what is false runs into the problems of accounting for the fact that God <i>does</i> have an image and a likeness: humans.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_52" id="ttf_10_52">52</a></sup> (To be properly <i>theological</i> by avoiding generalisations, arguably we must speak first of Christ as the image of God. But that is a subject for another day.)</p>
<p id="pz102-8">Thus, and in the second place, Sonderegger’s project is in danger of imposing certain metaphysically driven dogmatics onto the text. Whereas Barth managed to respect the grammar of Pauline concerns, and precisely so look beyond Paul, here I see, in Sonderegger, the text being forced onto a procrustean bed, even though it may be an “exalted” one, to cite Webster in my epigraph. The upshot is that this is not, I suggest, a biblical theology that entirely does justice to the adjective “biblical.”</p>
<p id="pz102-9">Further, this is why I must question the confidence that her method constitutes a proper theological reading. Metaphysics will have a part to play, but ultimately, a theological reading, if it is going to include necessary theological knowing, will directly involve <i>discipleship</i>. It follows that our (I think necessary) metaphysics must also continually seek to be discipled by the living Lord.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_53" id="ttf_10_53">53</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz102-10">Perhaps most importantly, and this flows from my previous points, I worry Sonderegger is awry to claim that the subject matter of Scripture is divine nature as One, when understood in her particular metaphysical terms. The subject matter of Scripture is not a human doctrine or expression but the <i>reality of the living God</i>, and this One known as such <i>in the knowing relation</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_54" id="ttf_10_54">54</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz103-6">Of course, I must immediately add that, speaking for Sonderegger’s whole project, she is asking fresh and important questions and that in doing so her <i>Systematics</i> adopts the kind of devotional rhetoric that encourages a delighted posture of worship. We have much to learn from her in this. On this count, we see her otherwise profound grasp of Pauline concerns. If only this found more direct expression in the content of her theological claims in these opening chapters.</p>
<p id="pz103-7">Second, I turn to a particular aspect of Stephen Holmes’s argumentation relating to the doctrine of the Trinity. Again, I am only picking up on a single strand of Holmes’s proposals, much as I did with Sonderegger. But I pull this thread in Holmes’s works because I suspect it is tied together with an underlying philosophical posture, which I will address shortly. This is to say that I do not address Jonathan Edwards directly, upon whom Holmes leans in this argument, because of the relationship between Holmes’s endorsement of these views and wider trends in contemporary theological discourse, which I take Holmes to represent.</p>
<p id="pz103-8">In a lively book in which two views on the Trinity were debated by four scholars, each were asked to answer the “so what?” question, to articulate the <i>use</i> of the doctrine. Now the doctrine of the Trinity has been pressed into the service of all manner of agendas, so Holmes is clear: “The doctrine of the Trinity is necessarily and precisely useless, and that point must never be surrendered.” The doctrine is an account of the divine life and “knowledge of the divine life is necessarily our highest end.” Following Jonathan Edwards, Holmes presses the point, and here I must cite him at length:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz103-9"><p class="blo">It is of the essence of a highest end that it has no use. A highest end is of value in itself, not an instrumental step to some other end. If the doctrine of the Trinity is taken . . . to be an anticipation, partial and hesitant, but still an anticipation, of this eschatological vision, then it can have no instrumental use. If the doctrine has any use, it is in clarifying errors about its own articulation. . . . Fundamentally, however, the doctrine serves no end.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_55" id="ttf_10_55">55</a></sup></p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz103-10">Some may sense tension here with my account of the knowledge of God in relation to Paul and “Barthian” theology. For I have been happy to argue that knowledge of God that is not discipleship—not a lived, concrete relation with God and others—is not theological knowledge at all, but a mere puffing up. For Holmes, however, the doctrine of the Trinity must be “useless.”</p>
<p id="pz104-6">Now of course, Holmes presents the doctrine of the Trinity as a mode of worship, which is to be noted. So my concern is not a large one. I worry, simply, that Holmes may have allowed an abstract conceptuality to condition his God-talk, much like we see in Sonderegger. Here it is the ordering of theological topics according to a means-end schema. And I propose that adherence to this logic, while seemingly reasonable, is not without problems.</p>
<p id="pz104-7">Although all theological rhetoric <i>can</i> be subjected to such classification, it may not always be appropriate and so create more problems. For starters, and as is well-known, ethical actions can be organised and evaluated according to a means-end schema, as teleological positions insist. But it does not always seem appropriate. Some means, such as murdering innocents or torture, seem wrong whatever ends supposedly justify them. Hence there are deontological accounts of ethics. The point is that a means-end schema does not always seem obviously correct for all actions, so why should it be used as a formal structuring principle articulating the doctrine of God?</p>
<p id="pz104-8">The means-end schema also seems to assume a metaphysic in which a distinction between actions (as means) on the one hand and states of affairs (as ends) on the other is fundamental. So the beatific vision, which Holmes refers to in his argument, is an accomplished state and all means are understood in terms of usefulness, as “instrumental steps.” But must theology commit to this philosophy? Perhaps this resonates well with wider philosophical/theological commitments in Holmes’s work. After all, if an account of God’s goodness is at home in philosophical accounts of divine simplicity—which Holmes promotes with great learning—this does suggest an account of perfection that implies stasis. Hence the end can be more easily associated with a “state of affairs” as opposed to actions, which tend to be instrumentalised. The figure of Aristotle is not far away, for whom relation, location, and action are accidental to a thing’s essence.</p>
<p id="pz104-9">In other words, while I appreciate the notion that doctrine, for Holmes, seems to be articulated as a worshipful beholding of the life of God, my concern is that matters are framed too statically. And this philosophy does seem less comfortable in the world in which the liveliness of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is central. Indeed, does not the Christian theologian have resources for thinking of the highest end in active terms, as worship rendered in acts of service? As Paul says, “Present your <i>bodies as a living sacrifice</i>, holy and acceptable to God, which is your <i>spiritual worship</i>” (Rom 12:1).</p>
<p id="pz104-10">Furthermore, Paul tends to portray Christ as both means and end, which further problematizes these distinctions. On the one hand, and as we have already seen, Paul can speak of Christ as the instrument through whom <span id="z105-6">we live (1 Cor 8:6). We also boast through him (Rom 5:11), are delivered by God through him (Rom 7:25), are conquerors through him (Rom 8:37), and “every tongue acknowledges that Jesus Christ is Lord” for its own end? No! “To the glory of God the Father” (Phil 2:11).</span></p>
<p id="pz105-7">And yet elsewhere, and less frequently acknowledged even by New Testament scholars, Paul can also speak of Christ in terms of his ultimate end. In Philippians 1:20, Paul is only concerned that “Christ will be exalted now as always in my body, whether by life or by death.” He then adds “for to me, living is Christ” (1:21). Indeed, Paul regards “everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” (3:7–8). Or again, in 1 Thessalonians 4:17–18 and 5:10–11, both passages speak of being with Christ as the greatest hope, and so on. Christ is both means and end. Why, then, seek to fit an account of the life of God into a means-end schema? The means-end schema can be useful to clarify thought, but it should not condition the nature of God-talk. This is why, despite agreement that the doctrine of the Trinity attempts to worshipfully articulate the eschatological vision of the divine life, I hesitate to speak of the doctrine of God in terms of being useful <i>or</i> useless, as a means <i>or</i> an end.</p>
<h2 id="pz105-8">C<span class="smallcaps" id="ADWg">ONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz105-9">To conclude, Paul had a controversy with the Corinthian “knowledgeable,” one which, I have argued, our construals of the task of dogmatics can take on board. If, with Gäckle, we maintain that the propositions of these Corinthians were “grounded on an intellectualised knowledge of the world and God,” then Paul responded by insisting on both the participatory and provisional nature of necessary knowing. Even affirmation of true propositions does not necessarily constitute knowledge for Paul. This is to say that the intellectualised knowledge of some Corinthians wrongly claimed that their knowledge was sufficient, a knowledge possessed external to that network of relationships with God and his people that constitute the coordinating axes of the knowledge God has of us.</p>
<p id="pz105-10">“Barthian” theology resonates profoundly with much of this, both in its understanding of theological propositions as always “derivative of and dependent on the actual knowing relation” (so Diller), as well as in the manner in which it locates theological knowledge in the wider grammar of faith, obedience, and repentance. This offered “Barthian” theology a sense for the dangers of loose conceptuality, abstracted from discipleship and from the particularity of the name Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="pz106-4">But other more recent trends, I worry, are starting to lose this Barthian sensibility, and so are allowing various abstract conceptualities to condition their God-talk. Again, my target is not philosophical categories per se, but the role they play in <i>governing</i> God-talk. And in Sonderegger, I suggest that we see an abstract concept of oneness, one associated with a static “Whatness,” deployed with significant hermeneutical force. But pressed through Scripture, this marginalises Scripture’s account of God’s oneness in terms of its own network of related themes. So MacDonald argues that Deuteronomy’s explication of oneness “<i>cannot be abstracted from the relationship between YHWH and Israel</i>,” and this dovetails precisely with the participatory account of “necessary knowing” that one sees in Paul. An account of oneness that appears merely as sheer fact does not put one firmly enough on the right side of Paul’s contrasts in 1 Corinthians 8 and ultimately leads to a misconstrual of the very subject matter of Scripture.</p>
<p id="pz106-5">Although Holmes understands the doctrine of the Trinity to involve a worshipful beholding of the divine life, his suggestions were also controlled by the imposition of a means-end logic that established the meaning of God-talk. While containing some pedagogical use, Holmes’s move nevertheless distracts from facilitating scriptural nuance. Indeed, I worry that the means-end logic is undergirded by wider philosophical commitments about stasis and perfection that seem discordant with Paul’s understanding of necessary knowing. Both examples, I suggest, impose abstractions on Scripture, pulling through mere scriptural threads, rather than allow, in that cruciform and two-way hermeneutical movement, the matrix of interrelated scriptural themes to find voice. If this continues unchallenged, I predict that the gap between dogmatics and biblical studies will widen even further.</p>
<p id="pz106-6">Instead, if we are going to articulate the task of dogmatics in conversation with the apostle Paul, as I have argued, it will mean questioning all accounts that allow abstract conceptuality to determine the nature of theological knowledge; otherwise, we evacuate theology of the kind of necessary knowing Paul articulates in 1 Corinthians 8. To do anything else would be to agree with the Corinthian knowledgeable against Paul, and imply that there is a knowledge of God that is not necessarily bound up with the life of discipleship. But such knowledge puffs up. <i>Love</i> builds up, for anyone who loves God is known by him.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_10_56" id="ttf_10_56">56</a></sup></p>

Thiselton, <i>The First Epistle to the Corinthians. A Commentary on the Greek Text</i> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2000) and Erik Waaler, <i>The Shema and the First Commandment in First Corinthians: An Intertextual Approach to Paul’s Re-Reading of Deuteronomy</i> (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008).

Schnabel, <i>Der erste Brief des Paulus an die Korinther</i> (Wuppertal: Brockhaus, 2006); Schrage, <i>Korinther</i>. Further confusion can be avoided by remembering that Paul is dealing with different situations in this argument: with food explicitly dedicated to an idol and eaten in the temple precincts in one case, with food which may or may not have been offered to an idol and eaten in a private house in another, and so on. Furthermore, Paul argues pastorally and wants to <i>convince</i> his addressees, in 1 Cor 8, not simply command. He wants to engage with their own position and win them over.</span></p>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#ttf_10_8" id="pz91-15">8</a>. <span epub:type="footnote" id="ftt_10_8">Of course, “relational” is a slippery word, use of which can create problems. See N. T.

Holmes, “Classical Trinity: Evangelical Perspective,” in <i>Two Views on the Doctrine of the Trinity</i>, ed. Jason S. Sexton (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2014), 28, 37–39. To be clear, I use relational in the sense colored by Paul’s own argumentation. So, at a theoretical level I do not necessarily mean by “relational” more than “the way in which one person or thing is related to another” (Judy Pearsall and William R. Trumble, eds, <i>The Oxford English Reference Dictionary</i> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995], 1216). But in terms of descriptions of Paul, the word tends to indicate interpersonal relationality rather than impersonal relations of, say, “origin.” I am attempting faithfully to name that participatory and interpersonal dynamic in Paul’s own discourse. This means that objections that point merely to the various ways “relational” can be used, as if this thereby makes deployment of the word necessarily redundant, should be seen as nothing but a cheap attempt to side-step issues originating from scriptural resources.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ttf_10_13" id="pz92-14">13</a>. <span epub:type="footnote" id="ftt_10_13">He marks a shift from 8:1–3 to 8:4ff. by using the coordinating conjunction, “therefore” (οὖν). Something <i>follows</i> as a consequence of his reasoning in 8:1–3. What is more, Paul <i>repeats the opening phrase</i> that introduced the whole section (περὶ δὲ τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων), making it now more specific, a subset of what he has already discussed. It is unsurprising, then, even if it remains insufficiently acknowledged by NT scholarship, that the C/P contrast established in 8:1–3 is repeated in 8:4–6.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ttf_10_15" id="pz93-11">15</a>. <span epub:type="footnote" id="ftt_10_15">Paul is not saying simply that “no idol in the world exists” as there <i>are</i> many gods and lords (when understood as λεγόμενοι, “so-called,” gods). Indeed, it almost seems that Paul wanted to start correcting claim (1) of C<sub>2</sub> more extensively, but then swerved back onto course to stick more closely with the C/P contrast set up in 8:1–3, and he does so by turning immediately to claim (2) in C<sub>2</sub>. This at least would explain some of the bumpy grammar in these verses.</span></p>

Paul speaks of a knowledge bound up with being adopted by God (4:5–6; see also Rom 8:15), with <i>coming to be known by God</i> (Gal 4:9), with repentance from the weak and poor elements of the world, and so on. Paul’s God-talk repeatedly turns to relational themes, to discipleship. Such are the kind of concerns which correlate with the knowledge of God, for Paul.</span></p>
