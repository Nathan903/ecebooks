<p class="noind" id="pz15-7">W<span class="smallcaps" id="A44C">HERE TO BEGIN</span>? This question is not just a concern for writers of fiction. It is also a problem for the theologian. It is, in fact, a question about theological method. <i>Where</i> one begins theologically is often as important in shaping the end product as <i>how</i> one proceeds theologically. We might say that where you start and how you get to your goal are two fundamental issues in theological method. It is like preparing to set out on a journey. Before embarking upon the trip, one must consider where it will begin and where it will end, as well as how to go about getting from the beginning to the end—whether on foot, on horseback, by car, or by means of some other mode of transport. In some ways, this is similar to the task of dogmatics, which is itself an intellectual journey where the great themes of the gospel are set out and arranged to highlight certain key ideas, or focus attention on certain topics. In this way, how dogmatics is organized, including the particular ordering and privileging of certain themes and notions, is as much a part of the methodological task as the place where one starts.</p>
<p id="pz15-8">In casual usage, the two terms “dogmatics” and “systematic theology” are often treated synonymously, to indicate what working theologians produce. But the two terms carry differing connotations worth attending to. These may be picked out by noting the root terms “system” and “dogma.” Systematic theology tends to be the broader term, including all sorts of discussions of theological topics, even those details that have not been the subject of official ecclesial teaching. The idea of system may sometimes include the notion that there is a central, coherent principle that generates the theological statements, but it always includes the idea of an integrated whole in which the interconnection of the parts is explicated. Dogmatics is a subfield, being the section of systematic theology that is relevant to church dogma. It theologizes about the subject matter of official, public declarations of responsible church authorities in Christian history. In doing so, it explicitly locates the dogmatician within the church, reckoning with the confessional significance of dogma. It seems more natural to us to speak <span id="z16-6">of an individual theologian’s systematic theology, but it sounds odd to speak of an individual theologian’s dogmatics. In the middle of the twentieth century, it made sense that Paul Tillich entitled his magnum opus, with its philosophical preoccupations and its concern for answering secular questioners, his <i>Systematic Theology</i>. Likewise, the most apt name for Karl Barth’s multivolume theological work in service of Christian proclamation was the <i>Church Dogmatics</i>. The terms are not fixed, and variations in usage exist, but the distinction is evident if we imagine Tillich writing a <i>Dogmatics</i> or Barth writing a <i>Systematic Theology</i>. It wouldn’t be right.</span></p>
<p id="pz16-7">Often theologians distinguish between formal and material (or substantive) considerations in dogmatics. On the one hand, a formal consideration has to do with how a thing is conceived and organized. To return to our previous example, the formal qualities of the journey include the places where it begins and ends, and the mode of transport taken. On the other hand, the substance of the journey is the sequence of events that comprise the whole activity from the moment one starts out to the moment one completes the trip. Yet in theological method, formal and material or substantive considerations overlap because the way in which the task is conceived inevitably shapes the way in which we approach and even organize the particular topics considered. Barth’s work is a good modern example of this. He found himself unable to complete his projected <i>Christian Dogmatics</i> because he worried that he had made a methodological false step. So he began again with his task in the <i>Church Dogmatics</i>, which is very much an account of Christian doctrine in a christological key, Christ being the center from whom all other doctrines radiate out. A very different approach to the matter can be found in, say, Friedrich Schleiermacher, whose <i>Christian Faith</i> focused on the experience of the divine, the sense of absolute dependence upon God, and the articulation of this experience in Christian doctrine as a second order activity. Schleiermacher’s method drove him to relegate the Trinity to an appendix—a significant dogmatic decision if ever there was one!</p>
<p id="pz16-8">Another distinction often made in post-Reformation dogmatics is between archetypal and ectypal theology. Theology from a God’s-eye view is archetypal, whereas theology that attempts to think God’s thoughts after him is ectypal. If we think of theology in this second way, then the dogmatic task is about trying to ascertain God’s thoughts after him. But, of course, this raises additional questions about where to find God speaking. Primarily, God speaks in Scripture (at least, according to <i>Christian</i> theology). But does he not also speak by means of the natural world? And <span id="z17-6">may he not also speak in other ways—by means of the sense of divinity with which we are all born, for instance? John Calvin certainly thought so, and placed his discussion of the twofold knowledge of all things—of God and of ourselves—at the very beginning of his <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion.</i> Few have followed his lead, though it has been influential on much Reformed theology.</span></p>
<p id="pz17-7">Faith seeks understanding. This too is a venerable theme in discussions of theological method that can be traced through Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury to Bishop Augustine of Hippo. For we begin with faith, standing within the faith, not as some disinterested spectator watching from the sidelines. Theologians seek to understand something of the faith that they have been given. They do not cogitate about religious matters independent of their own experience of the divine. What is more, the faith-seeking-understanding tradition of theology has the merit of intellectual humility in the face of the divine mystery as well. We seek to understand all right, but we do not presume that we will ever completely apprehend the divine. Perhaps all our theologizing will seem like “so much straw,” as it did, in the end, to the great Thomas Aquinas. Faced with the brilliance of the divine presence, as Isaiah was when he found himself in the courtroom vision recorded in <a href="chapter12.xhtml#pARvJ" id="AlED">chapter 6</a> of that book, we may well find ourselves unable to say anything more than “Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty” (Isa 6:5).</p>
<p id="pz17-8">Does that mean we should not even try to understand something of the mystery of divinity? Not at all. But it should chasten our attempts to do so. The contributors to this volume would, we think, agree with that particular sentiment.</p>
<p id="pz17-9">A final thought about theological method: the preoccupation with theological method is a very modern concern. When one reads much classical theology, it is striking how few discussions of method there actually are. In recent times Jeffrey Stout, among others, has worried about the interminable theological “throat-clearing” that is discussion of methodological matters. Will we ever get to the substance of theology? We have already indicated one reason why such hard-and-fast distinctions may be misplaced. But also, in a postmodern world with multiple approaches to knowing and to the theological task, it is not surprising that methodological discussion has taken a much more prominent place in dogmatics. Nevertheless, it might be objected that discussion of theological method, and of prolegomena more generally, is not theology as such. It is more like discussion of how to proceed <span id="z18-6">in theology, or what we might call metatheology—or even, as some recent authors have put it, the philosophy of theology. But metatheology is not theology any more than planning a journey is the same as journeying. Some of the essays collected here reflect this tension. There are methodological essays here that do include both formal and material elements, moving from metatheology to theology proper. Others are more clearly just about method (and therefore more obviously candidates for the term “metatheology”). Even this distinction is not perhaps as hard-and-fast as has sometimes been thought. But whether it is metatheology or dogmatics that is being engaged in, the theological task is the focus of attention.</span></p>
<p id="pz18-7">This brings us to the essays themselves. In <a href="chapter07.xhtml#pz23-3" id="AaaX">chapter 1</a>, Kevin Vanhoozer undertakes the ambitious task of defining what dogmatic statements are. He argues that dogmatic statements occur somewhere between what he calls the analytics and the poetics of dogmatics. If the analytics of dogmatics emphasizes producing a conceptual representation of what reason has learned from following the text exegetically (Vanhoozer cites John Webster’s work as one of the best examples), then the poetics of dogmatics adds to this an equal preoccupation with the form and genre in which this representation is communicated (examples of this include von Balthasar and Vanhoozer himself). The approach by analytics risks giving the impression that theology has improved on Scripture’s own witness; the approach by poetics risks being untranslatably fixated on given forms. Vanhoozer proposes that the entire project of pronouncing dogmatic judgments is best comprehended by the category of mission. Dogmatic statements, on this model, are “statements on a mission.” They draw the church into the communicative acts of the triune God’s mission, pressing the church to witness to that work in its indicative judgments about “what is in Christ.” Chief among the benefits of conceiving dogmatics as witness is that it draws attention to the corporate and active character of dogmatics, which includes the gestures and forms of community life as well as statements.</p>
<p id="pz18-8">In <a href="chapter08.xhtml#pz49-3" id="ASxR">chapter 2</a>, Scott Swain asks about the systematic character of dogmatics. He considers dogmatics a mixed species of wisdom, including a practical and a theoretical aspect, both <i>phronesis</i> and <i>sophia</i>. This mixed character derives from its status as a response to God’s self-revelation as recorded in Scripture. Because the ultimate object of theological understanding is the triune God, the entire project has its ultimate basis in wonder in the face of mystery. In commending the fruits of its contemplation to others, dogmatic formulations take on a systematic character; indeed, when dogmatics elaborates its wisdom as knowledge of God on the one hand and <span id="z19-6">knowledge of all things relative to God on the other hand, it approaches its own systematic potential. When dogmatics does this, it is best equipped not only to tend to its own affairs but also to serve other disciplines. Dogmatics, on Swain’s account, is not a view from nowhere. It is instead “a view of God from God in the presence of God.”</span></p>
<p id="pz19-7">In <a href="chapter09.xhtml#pz70-3" id="ABDC">chapter 3</a>, Sameer Yadav argues that the nature of Christian doctrine is a form of ontological commitment to an overarching biblical narrative of creation and redemption. The function of a doctrine is to state what must or may be the case if indeed the narrative corresponds to the way things are. Fundamental doctrines that are defining of a Christian identity are those that must be the case on pain of denying the correctness of the narrative, while nonfundamental doctrines are those that merely may be the case if that narrative is correct. After Yadav characterizes this conception and meets some objections, he shows how it situates the Bible as a norming norm in formulating doctrine, as well as how it can accommodate various competing intuitions about the nature of doctrine (e.g., as a cultural-linguistic rule, as an expression of lived religious experience, and as a recapitulation of scriptural assertions). He believes that adopting this analysis could facilitate engagement across boundaries of deep theological disagreement, since disputants could proceed from a shared conception of theology’s evidence base and its primary mode of reasoning from that evidence.</p>
<p id="pz19-8"><a href="chapter10.xhtml#pAHsH" id="ApXa">Chapter 4</a> turns to the interface between biblical studies and systematic theology. Chris Tilling’s chapter explores the task of dogmatics in light of the apostle Paul’s deployment of a framing <i>theologoumenon</i> in 1 Corinthians 8–10. Tilling argues that Paul responded to the “knowledgeable” Corinthians, and particularly their understanding of the nature of theology (mediated to us in the propositions in 8:4), by redirecting them to the self-involving, covenantal, and love-for-God orientated nature of monotheistic rhetoric (see 8:2–3). This is then taken in a christological direction in 8:6, 12 and 10:1–22. The christological monotheism that unfolds in this section of Paul’s letter bespeaks a relational, lived reality that penetrates interpersonal practices, goals, and desires. This corresponds with Paul’s “relational” epistemological tendencies which, taken with his argument in 1 Corinthians 8–10, informs Christian explication of the task of dogmatics. This is brought into conversation with claims about the task of the doctrine of the Trinity in the scholarship of British historical theologian Stephen Holmes, thereby providing a case study of “joined up” biblical and historical systematic theology.</p>
<p id="pz19-9">In <a href="chapter11.xhtml#pz107-3" id="ARYa">chapter 5</a>, the French evangelical theologian Henri Blocher addresses <span id="z20-6">himself to the issue of the permanent validity and contextual relativity of doctrinal statements. Blocher is conversant with a wide range of historical and social contexts that call dogma into question, and he provides an insightful survey of the relativizing influences of modern intellectual culture. When these other voices have had their say, however, Blocher maintains that Christian doctrine continues to be valid, not only because of its ultimately transcendent source in divine revelation but also because of the unity of creation. While intellectuals may let each other get away with using tropes and metaphors claiming that humans live in different worlds from each other, the truth is that we live today in the same world as Abraham. Blocher appeals to canon sense and common sense (though his common sense is informed by theorists like Ricouer and his canon sense is similarly sophisticated) in defense of what he calls “present truth,” echoing the formulation found in 2 Peter 1:12.</span></p>
<p id="pz20-7">Katherine Sonderegger returned to the LA Theology Conference to give the paper that became <a href="chapter12.xhtml#pARvJ" id="AP4XL">chapter 6</a>. It is a highly constructive account of the nature of Scripture as a source of theological authority in dogmatics. Sonderegger has already published the first volume of her <i>Systematic Theology</i>, which deliberately eschewed extensive reflection on methodology and instead included a number of implicit commitments regarding the nature of theology. In this chapter, “Holy Scripture as Sacred Ground,” she gives a public account of the doctrine of Scripture that undergirds her work. After showing that Holy Scripture cannot be contained in any available categories, genres, or contexts, Sonderegger argues that it is not only an incomparable book literarily or historically considered; Scripture is “strongly unique.” As a sheerly given reality in God’s economy, it is perhaps a mode of divine presence, or at the very least the crucial place of divine presence. Theologians do their work in its presence in a way analogous to how Moses behaves before the burning bush; or they should.</p>
<p id="pz20-8">In <a href="chapter12a.xhtml#pz144-3" id="AVCm">chapter 7</a>, Darren Sumner focuses on whether the procedure and content of systematic theology should be Christocentric. Karl Barth famously stated that all theology must finally be Christology, that is, at every point beginning from and normed by the event of Jesus Christ. John Webster, in contrast, suggests that taking one’s departure always from the immanent Trinity makes for a more well-rounded and capacious theology. This chapter seeks to adjudicate the relationship between Trinity and Christology in theological method, inquiring as to whether one of these ought to serve to the other. In a constructive proposal, Sumner suggests that the pattern of proper systematic discourse is not linear or progressive but rather fractal, <span id="z21-6">that is, the repetition of a set pattern producing an increasingly complex symmetry, wherein the microcosm replicates the macrocosm perfectly in scale. This has a number of advantages over more linear models. Here Christology serves not as the starting point but the “pattern” that is reproduced in different ways (i.e., nonrecursively) at every point throughout the whole. The doctrine of the Trinity is the starting point in this proposal, so that dogmatics begins from God and God’s works, and proceeds in an unavoidably christological key.</span></p>
<p id="pz21-7">In <a href="chapter13.xhtml#pz162-3" id="AMIV">chapter 8</a>, James Arcadi argues that truthmaker theory illuminates Barth’s discussion of the relations among church proclamation, dogmatics, and the Word of God, in his <i>Church Dogmatics</i>. A standard principle in truthmaker theory is as follows: <i>a truthmaker is that in virtue of which something is true</i>. Arcadi argues that one interpretation of the “in virtue of” relation—that of an entailment relation—aptly clarifies what Barth means by the “agreement” relation between church proclamation and the Word of God in <i>Church Dogmatics</i> I/1. The task of dogmatics, then, is to evaluate when and how talk about God is entailed by the Word of God and thus has the Word of God as its truthmaker. One extension of this notion is the way that persons stand as truthmakers for propositions about themselves. These propositions can be distinguished into third- and second-personal nuances due to the intentional stance of the proposition’s issuer. This further clarifies Barth’s concern to maintain the second-personal nature of proclamation because “the Word of God is spoken to man.”</p>
<p id="pz21-8">In <a href="chapter14.xhtml#pz178-3" id="ANEg">chapter 9</a>, Joshua Malone and Brannon Ellis consider the divine perfections and the shape of dogmatics. The chapter begins to develop an approach to the doctrine of the divine attributes that fully affirms both the boundless uniqueness of the one God and the christological location of God’s self-disclosure as our Father in his Son and by his Spirit. Taking their cue from John Webster, the authors argue that God’s aseity and simplicity should form our scriptural reasoning about the divine attributes, in the sense of bracketing the scope and shape of all our theological claims. At the same time, Trinity and Christology should inform theological reasoning, in the sense of pervasively characterizing the content of those claims and governing their interrelations. The chapter ends with applications for the practice of dogmatics beyond the doctrine of God.</p>
<p id="pz21-9">In <a href="chapter15.xhtml#pA-Rt" id="AafA">chapter 10</a>, Michael Allen takes up the issue of dogmatics as ascetics. He argues that the sanctifying ends of ascetic discipline are not simply a set of spiritual supplements that ought to be added to the theological task. Instead, fruits of sanctification like worship and discernment ought to be <span id="z22-6">located within the theological task itself, and especially in the theological task conceived of as dogmatics within the church. Allen’s recommendation of a theology with self-renunciatory and purgative effects has much in common with Sarah Coakley’s <i>théologie totale</i>, one of the most ambitious projects on the current theological scene. Allen develops his own theses in a running critique of Coakley’s project, in order to bring out what is distinctive about the kind of Reformed dogmatics that have an eye on the holiness appropriate to theology and its practitioners. Where Coakley engages a stunning profusion of cognate disciplines and literatures, using their insights to disrupt theology’s conventional narrowness, Allen instead commends John Webster’s intentional limitation of the dogmatic task to a narrow set of sources and texts. In a set of theses for a Reformed dogmatics that achieves ascetic ends, Allen spells out some implications for the doctrine of God and for theological anthropology.</span></p>
<p id="pz22-7">In the last chapter of the volume, Gavin Ortlund asks, “Why Should Protestants Retrieve Patristic and Medieval Theology?” Locating his essay within the growing body of literature on theological retrieval, Ortlund notes that the retrieval of patristic and medieval theology has been an underexplored and underappreciated task among Protestant Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants in the United States. Identifying B. B. Warfield’s retrieval of Augustine as an example various modern Protestant tendencies, he points to the retrieval practices of the Reformers as a more helpful model, suggesting that Protestant theology can and should be rooted in the entire history of the church. He then offers a taxonomy of four particular ways that patristic and medieval theology can resource contemporary Protestant theology, each with a metaphor and then an example or case study. The chapter concludes with three specific case studies of early medieval texts that may be especially helpful to retrieve: Boethius’s <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i>, Gregory the Great’s <i>The Book of Pastoral Rule</i>, and John of Damascus’s writings on the iconoclast controversy.</p>
