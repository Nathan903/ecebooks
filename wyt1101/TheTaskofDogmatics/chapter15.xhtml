And to that liturgical and spiritual end, he identified a need for “discern[ing] what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect” (12:2). Worship is not only bodily but also intentional, rational, and reflective. The testing of discernment shapes and sustains the course of self-sacrifice. Paul also warns of a twofold threat to this discerning offering of one’s own body: first, warning that we might be “conformed to the world” (12:2) or led astray by cultural malformation, and second, that we might simply remain where we are and as we are or left in our own calcifying darkness. Indeed, <span id="z190-6">it is crucial to observe that he not only calls for a stiff-arm to be thrown to the whelming flood of cultural pressures but that he then presses away from the spiritual status quo as well: “be transformed by the renewal of your mind” (Rom 12:2). So Paul’s call to worshipful discernment must press away undue influence but cannot rest content there; it must also press into the sanctifying, renewing work of God upon our own minds.</span></p>
<p id="pz190-7">Theology must serve spiritual purposes. Theology leads to praise, and theology shapes wise and prudential reasoning.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_2" id="ttf_15_2">2</a></sup> But to those ends, Christian theology first cuts against the cultural grain and cuts across our own sinful selves. The question for us becomes: can dogmatic theology with its focus upon seemingly settled resources be a practice of unsettling our sinful ways? Might this most ecclesiastical of Christian intellectual enterprises be a tool for the “renewing of our minds” or must it inherently privilege the status quo? We do well to note that suspicions have arisen in recent years regarding the supposedly ontotheological, hegemonic, and phallocentric tendencies of systematic theology in contemporary theological discussions.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_3" id="ttf_15_3">3</a></sup></p>
<p id="A7Mr">Perhaps unsurprisingly, another pathway has dominated theological discourse in recent years as a purported means to address this stultifying status quo: “Theology and . . .” Many such pairings have garnered significant attention in recent decades: theology and economics, theology and gender, theology and literature, and perhaps more obviously, theology and politics. Drawing on other realms of thought has been seen as a way of enlivening the doctrinal task, loosening the stultifying grip of old orthodoxies, and fostering a more faithful humanism. The following essay might be thought to offer yet another pairing: theology and ascetics. Perhaps ascetics is simply another conversation partner which can—must!—leaven dogmatics. In such an approach, ascetics would add moral and self-renunciatory facets to a dogmatics which is itself anything but. But I wish to suggest that dogmatics holds a unique place in the intellectual work of the Christian church. It is not superior work. In many ways, it is subservient to other tasks. For instance, the discernment and worship <span id="z191-6">that Paul attests, as of penultimate and ultimate significance in Romans 12:1–2, and its practitioners, as officers of the church, serve to equip the saints for the work of ministry (Eph 4:11–12). Worship and witness are the first order activities of Christian language, but the wisdom won by being wrestled to the ground with God’s truth serves as an instrument and means of intellectual discipleship without which we dare not journey.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_4" id="ttf_15_4">4</a></sup> Construed as a tool of discipleship, then, Christian dogmatics plays a unique role in the rhythms of Christian sanctification and, by God’s grace, does so with its own disciplinary integrity.</span></p>
<p id="pz191-7">To offer something approximating an argument for this claim, I will begin by considering what likely seems to be the most companionable approach to an ascetical theological method today, namely, the <i>théologie totale</i> articulated by Sarah Coakley in her systematic theology. I will then compare Coakley’s account of desire and knowledge with the way in which the late John Webster articulated the “holiness of theology.” In so doing, I will seek to show that Webster sustained the spiritual and even ascetical intuitions so powerfully articulated by Coakley, though he did so by pressing beyond mere systematic theology to the task of Christian dogmatics. I will progress further still in concluding the essay with some principles for envisioning Christian dogmatics as a practice of intellectual asceticism and discipleship.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_5" id="ttf_15_5">5</a></sup></p>

<p class="noind" id="pz191-9">Purgation and desire go together, at least that is the wager of Sarah Coakley, who has previously argued so poignantly that power and submission are <span id="z192-6">necessary bedfellows.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_6" id="ttf_15_6">6</a></sup> In the much acclaimed first installment of her systematic theology, <i>God, Sexuality, and the Self</i>, Coakley argues that “theology involves not merely the metaphysical task of adumbrating a vision of God, the world, and humanity, but simultaneously the epistemological task of cleansing, reordering, and redirecting the apparatuses of one’s own thinking, desiring, and seeing.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_7" id="ttf_15_7">7</a></sup> Theology does address metaphysics, with the divine and the creaturely realm coming in for assessment together, sure enough, but such ontological talk simultaneously concerns purifying the mind, the heart, and the eyes.</span></p>
<p id="pz192-7">Theology, then, is “fundamentally purgative of idolatry.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_8" id="ttf_15_8">8</a></sup> This purifying is no small matter, for Coakley attends to three looming threats, each of which are oftentimes presumed to render systematic theology invalid. First, ontotheology supposedly flattens the categories of the divine and the creaturely in a totalizing and thus blatantly idolatrous fashion.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_9" id="ttf_15_9">9</a></sup> Second, hegemony lurks as a threat whereby the powers and principalities can bend discourse and shape its very questions to prop up their own interests, suggesting that the system, as it were, determines what is systematic, even in theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_10" id="ttf_15_10">10</a></sup> Third, a specific feminist concern about the more subtle hegemony of male dominance—what might be called theology’s phallocentric form—has so permeated the Western tradition, at least, as to inscribe a male imaginary into the confessions and expositions of theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_11" id="ttf_15_11">11</a></sup> These three threats are actually one in manifold form: “Each presumes that the systematician idolatrously desires mastery: a complete understanding of God, a regnant position in society, or a domination of the gendered ‘other’; and each presumes that the same systematician will thereby abuse his knowledge, his power, or his ‘male’ mode of thinking, for purposes of intellectual, social, or sexual dominance.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_12" id="ttf_15_12">12</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz192-8">Theology cannot be severed from contemplation, if such threats without and within are to be exposed and defeated by grace. “The very act of contemplation—repeated, lived, embodied, suffered—is an act that, by grace, and over time, inculcates mental patterns of ‘un-mastery,’ welcomes the dark realm of the unconscious, opens up a radical attention to <span id="z193-6">the ‘other,’ and instigates an acute awareness of the messy entanglement of sexual desires and desire for God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_13" id="ttf_15_13">13</a></sup> Contemplation proves crucial here, for Coakley inverts one maxim of Freud, arguing instead that “desire is more fundamental than sex,” while affirming another such principle of his, namely, that sublimation of such desires is essential.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_14" id="ttf_15_14">14</a></sup> Theology “comes, that is, with the urge, the fundamental desire, to seek God’s ‘face,’ and yet to have that seeking constantly checked, corrected, and purged.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_15" id="ttf_15_15">15</a></sup> Those urges are not merely false judgments but, indeed, urges or desires: “To speak theologically: unredeemed desire is at the root of each of these challenges to the systematic task.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_16" id="ttf_15_16">16</a></sup> And such needed checks and balances take the form of systematic concern: “Wherever one desires to start has implications for the whole, and the parts must fit together.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_17" id="ttf_15_17">17</a></sup> They not only fit together but form one in that manner, for “the contemplative task, which rightly sustains systematics, is itself a progressive modulator and refiner of human desire: in its naked longing for God, it lays out all its other desires . . . and places them, over time, into the crucibles of divine desire.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_18" id="ttf_15_18">18</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz193-7">Contemplation cannot be myopic, then, but must be drawn upward and out to consider not only God and certain divine things of spiritual prestige. No, such would be to set the gaze upon the easily ossified. Coakley calls for a <i>théologie totale</i> which “makes the bold claim that the more systematic one’s intentions, the more necessary the exploration of such dark and neglected corners” as those found in the nooks and crannies of the Scriptures, the etchings of the catacombs, and the prayer-life of charismatic sects. And so the scope and sequence of her first volume—an “essay ‘on the Trinity’ ”—moves from two chapters which offer a programmatic and methodological entryway to the multivolume project toward a sequence of chapters on “praying the Trinity” in patristic texts on desire (ch. 3), on fieldwork investigations of English congregations in the charismatic world (ch. 4), on iconographic representations of the triune God (ch. 5), and then two final chapters addressing her own account of patristic Trinitarianism (ch. 6) and the interplay of desire, Trinity, and apophaticism (ch. 7).</p>
<p id="pz193-8">The title of her volume—<i>God, Sexuality, and the Self</i>—is not mere hodgepodge. She really does articulate a rather cogent, seamless garment wherein <span id="z194-6">an account of the Trinity and an understanding of desire (in God and in humanity) coalesce. She sublimates gender breakdowns or dichotomies, for example, in the triune account of God, avoiding a common move (by supposed conservatives or purported liberals) to pattern social practice on the triune life.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_19" id="ttf_15_19">19</a></sup> Rather, “twoness [of gender], one might say, is divinely ambushed by threeness [of triune reflexivity].”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_20" id="ttf_15_20">20</a></sup> And this third, the Holy Spirit, is thus determinative, for the Holy Spirit is the “inherent reflexivity in the divine.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_21" id="ttf_15_21">21</a></sup> The Trinitarian account shares much with recent revisions regarding doctrinal history. She disputes the dominant East/West dichotomy of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_22" id="ttf_15_22">22</a></sup> She opposes the proposals of so-called doctrinal critics, expounding the ascetical, exegetical, and simultaneously apophatic accounts of triunity found in Nyssa and others.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_23" id="ttf_15_23">23</a></sup> She even defends the traditional naming of the triune God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit over against largely feminist concern about its gendered connotations.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_24" id="ttf_15_24">24</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz194-7">Yet she also turns Trinitarianism somewhat on its head. Coakley operates with a strict dichotomy of her own, opposing what she calls an “incorporative” or “reflexive” model of the Trinity over against the “linear” schema. The linear model, so focused on processions and missions, finds its fullest expression in the Gospel according to John and bears within it the tendency toward an orthodoxy that may subordinate the Spirit, the other, the dark margins that alone can purge us.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_25" id="ttf_15_25">25</a></sup> A “prayer-based” and “Spirit-leading” approach will take up an incorporative or reflexive view of the Trinity, drawn primarily from Romans 8. Origen holds both views,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_26" id="ttf_15_26">26</a></sup> and writings of Nyssa and others (especially in oft overlooked texts) gesture toward this more enfolding approach, wherein the hope for our desire being retooled and recast comes from our being caught up in the divine life through the reflexively incorporative mission of the divine Spirit. Not only are we caught up, but she speaks of a “divine force” to overthrow our divine desire. We do contemplate the divine, so real agency is espoused <span id="z195-6">of the human practicing such intellectual and erotic purgation. Yet divine agency of a particularly intrusive sort is affirmed herein as necessary due to an affirmation of an Augustinian doctrine of sin.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_27" id="ttf_15_27">27</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz195-7">Coakley rightly treats mind and will together, although one will have to wait for her second and third volumes to see if her desire-tilted anthropology and Trinitarian schematic are balanced by a needed intellectualism rooted in the Logos of God. Even now, her blending of spirituality and theology can be perceived clearly and appreciated. Further, her commitment to a robust doctrine of sin and a concomitant account of divine agency in transforming, even purifying human selves and longings calls for profound gratitude. How rare to have someone, cognizant of the dangers of power and self-delusion alike, speak of the shape of submission or of asceticism in the midst of being enfolded or incorporated into the divine life.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_28" id="ttf_15_28">28</a></sup> We do well to explore, then, if a commitment not to systematic theology simply, much less to <i>théologie totale</i>, but to Christian dogmatics can also offer an account of intellectual asceticism and a spiritual vision of doctrine as a chastening instrument in the purgative work of God’s sanctifying presence.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz195-9">In a lecture given in the late 1990s at the University of Otago, a theologian addressed the “culture of theology” and in so doing called for “attentive, ascetic reading” of Holy Scripture and the classics of the Christian tradition.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_29" id="ttf_15_29">29</a></sup> The language occurs amidst discussion of what he calls the “rhetoric of effacement,” itself a correlate to “Christian eschatological culture” wherein “attention dispossesses us of our expectations; it involves self-renunciation, so that the gospel itself may speak of its own presence and vitality.” The language sounds ascetical: effacement, self-renunciation, dispossession, attentiveness unto the eschatological. In years when theology had been dogged by so-called doctrinal criticism and was beginning to be shaped by the emboldened claims of Radical Orthodoxy, such calls sounded a markedly different note. Several years later, John Webster took up those <span id="z196-6">concerns again in the first chapter of his book <i>Holiness</i>, an essay entitled “The Holiness of Theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_30" id="ttf_15_30">30</a></sup> That essay’s very existence is telling, in as much as Webster addressed the holiness of God, of the church, and of the Christian in later chapters only after first characterizing the very task of intellectual reflection in a certain way by attentively noting the holiness of theology.</span></p>
<p id="pz196-7">What demanded sustained attention in this quest to practice theology in a holy posture? Like Coakley, Webster attended to the ever-present threat of idolatry in its mental or intellectual form. Thinking about the divine is not inherently good unless one thinks about the true God in a faithful way. As this is not the only option in the religious market or even in the dark recesses of our hearts, “we need to make sure that we are thinking about the true God, and not about some God of our own invention.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_31" id="ttf_15_31">31</a></sup> Webster was drawing on specifically Reformed resources, such as Calvin’s keen eye toward idolatry, in offering such a theological stiff-arm to undue speculation or underdisciplined theological exuberance.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_32" id="ttf_15_32">32</a></sup> Webster introduced this book, of which “The Holiness of Theology” serves as the introductory essay, as a “Trinitarian dogmatics of holiness.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_33" id="ttf_15_33">33</a></sup> It, thus, provides a helpful point by which we might assess how a specifically dogmatic theology may or may not flow from and further fund a pursuit of intellectual asceticism. We must assess in what ways Webster’s project moved with and diverges from that of Coakley. A sketch of his approach sets the stage, then, for such comparison.</p>
<p id="pz196-8">He offered a thesis: “A Christian theology of holiness is an exercise of holy reason; it has its context and its content in the revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity which is set forth in Holy Scripture; it is a venture undertaken in prayerful dependence upon the Holy Spirit; it is an exercise in the fellowship of the saints, serving the confession of the holy people of God; it is a work in which holiness is perfected in the fear of God; and its end is the sanctifying of God’s holy name.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_34" id="ttf_15_34">34</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz196-9">A number of elements therein deserve expansion. First, this theological enterprise—the <i>very act of considering</i> what it means to be holy—is itself “an exercise of holy reason,” for “like all other aspects of human life, reason is a field of God’s sanctifying work.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_35" id="ttf_15_35">35</a></sup> Contrary to the idealized view of <span id="z197-6">knowledge and understanding in the Enlightenment era and as entrenched in modern rationalism, thinking is affected by sin and, thus, must be sanctified by God. Dogmatics begins with the recognition, gleaned not from feminist or postcolonialist theory but from Holy Scripture itself, that our minds are darkened and that we are wise only in our own eyes (e.g., 1 Cor 2:14; Isa 5:21; Prov 3:7). But dogmatics affirms that God does not leave us to our sinful selves; God sanctifies or sets apart our reason, and dogmatics is an instrument or tool in that divine work (Rom 12:1–2). The first rule of such thinking laid out by Webster noted the significance of this move: “Theological thinking <i>about</i> holiness is itself an exercise <i>of</i> holiness. Theology is an aspect of the sanctification of reason, that is, of the process in which reason is put to death and made alive by the terrifying and merciful presence of the holy God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_36" id="ttf_15_36">36</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz197-7">Second, this theological enterprise—the <i>very act of considering</i> what it means to be holy—“has its context and content in the revelatory presence of the Holy Trinity.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_37" id="ttf_15_37">37</a></sup> That God reveals himself provides the context for theology’s possibility; not only that, but God’s revelation of himself is the very content of theology’s consideration. In other words, theology is a “positive science” which thinks after (<i>nachdenken</i>) that which God has revealed, working “both from and towards” the given. So “holy reason is not a <i>poetic</i> but a <i>receptive</i> enterprise; indeed, in Christian theology, poetics is tantamount to idolatry.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_38" id="ttf_15_38">38</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz197-8">Webster labors at just this point, for it is in his diagnosis and prescription against idolatry that his project differs from so much of the contemporary scene: “Theology is nothing other than an attempt to repeat the name which God gives to himself as he manifests himself with sovereign mercy, ‘I am the Lord, your Holy One’ (Isa. 43.15).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_39" id="ttf_15_39">39</a></sup> Two attending claims follow by necessity: first, theology is not religious phenomenology or, specifically in this case, the <i>very act of considering</i> what it means to be holy does not focus upon a human experience of the “tremendous mystery” (as in Rudolf Otto) or the numinous; second, theology attends to Holy Scripture as its norm and limit.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_40" id="ttf_15_40">40</a></sup> We might ask why that negation and that affirmation are so central. In so doing, we can see that Webster locates intellectual self-renunciation in a more densely defined context, it seems, than does Coakley.</p>
<p id="pz198-6">Idolatry is not something that we bat off with our own two hands, as if we were the last line of defense. We do not defeat the gods, whether of the world or of our own imagining. Like Coakley’s affirmation of divine agency here, Webster speaks of God’s encountering us and refusing to be mastered.</p> 
<blockquote id="pz198-7"><p class="blo">Because God is majestic and therefore to be feared before all things, to encounter him is to be encountered by that which we can never master, which can never become an object, an idea or pattern of words or experience that we can retrieve and inspect at will. . . . Reason can only be holy if it resists its own capacity for idolatry, its natural drift towards the profaning of God’s name by making common currency of the things of God. A holy theology, therefore, will be properly mistrustful of its own command of its subject-matter; modest; aware that much of what it says and thinks is dust.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_41" id="ttf_15_41">41</a></sup></p>
 </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz198-8">And Webster also offers an ecclesial location for this intellectual chastening; he speaks of theology as “<i>an exercise in the fellowship of the saints, serving the confession of the holy people of God</i>.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_42" id="ttf_15_42">42</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz198-9">Precisely here, Webster’s ecclesiology and concomitant methodology diverge from Coakley. Coakley attends to the “dark corners” of the church, turning not to Trinitarian treatises much less the creeds and confessions of the church, but to indirect attestation in individual writings on virginity and asceticism, to assessment of icons, and to fieldwork in a smattering of British charismatic communities. This <i>théologie totale</i> values breadth and catholicity, but it is questionable to what extent apostolicity proves to be an animating principle. Dogmatic theology, however, fixes first upon the apostolic writings and their prophetic precursors as the norm and limit to theological reflection and then upon the ecclesiastical rules which function as a guide for rightly dividing the word. It does so precisely because these texts are the embassies of divine self-revelation, taken up and sent out by the Risen Lord Jesus himself.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_43" id="ttf_15_43">43</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz198-10">So we have a divergence between extensive and intensive postures, conversational or dogmatic theology. Admittedly, Webster noted, “a good deal of contemporary systematic or dogmatic theology tends . . . to be <span id="z199-6">conversational or comparativist in approach. ‘Conversational’ theologies . . . construct Christian theology by drawing on a wide range of cultural, philosophical and religious sources to build up an account of the Christian faith through elaborating the associations and interrogations which occur as Christianity talks to others.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_44" id="ttf_15_44">44</a></sup> Coakley’s volume draws primarily on resources from the Christian faith, whether icons or fieldwork, exegesis or patristic <i>ressourcement</i>. Compared to, say, the various iterations of the Workgroup on Constructive Theology, her <i>God, Sexuality, and the Self</i> may well appear remarkably antiquarian and ecclesiastical in tone, resources, and claims.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_45" id="ttf_15_45">45</a></sup> Yet it is similarly driven in many ways by questions, concerns, animating principles from other fields, not least feminist and gender studies. Even in her inversion of some of these fields, Coakley has privileged their concerns and questions in constructing her theology. If ever there was an example of extensive theology, this <i>théologie totale</i> must be it.</span></p>
<p id="pz199-7">How did Webster describe his dogmatic approach? “By contrast, the kind of theology attempted here is less sanguine about the prospects for such exchanges. It more naturally thinks of its host culture, not as Athens, but as Babylon. It is acutely conscious of the menace of wickedness in the life of the mind.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_46" id="ttf_15_46">46</a></sup> Initially, Webster may sound like Coakley, but the divergence comes quickly thereafter. “And it is intensive before it is extensive. That is, its work is focused upon a quite restricted range of texts (the biblical canon) as they have been read and struggled with in the complex though unified reality which we call the tradition of the Church.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_47" id="ttf_15_47">47</a></sup> He admits, of course, that such may seem stultifying. “Such an understanding of theology enjoys rather little contemporary prestige, and is commonly judged to be naïve, assertive, authoritarian, above all, closed.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_48" id="ttf_15_48">48</a></sup> But it is worth noting that his claim runs just the opposite way. “Yet although it is intensive in this way, it is not stable or settled. The persistence with which it returns to its singular <span id="z200-6">theme is an attempt to face the reality of the gospel as a permanent source of unsettlement, discomfiture and renewal of vocation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_49" id="ttf_15_49">49</a></sup> And he locates this rattling of the intellectual sabers within the action of the very present God: “The intensity of this kind of theology is not the internally-directed energy of an achieved, separated world of ideas, but that of a way of thinking which might be called eschatological—always, that is, emerging from its own dissolution and reconstitution by the presence of the holy God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_50" id="ttf_15_50">50</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz200-7">So Webster’s Reformed approach to catholic doctrine shares a self-renunciatory and purgative facet with Coakley’s project. The two projects also share a common commitment to an Augustinian hamartiology and its necessary overcoming by the gracious missions of Son and Spirit. Webster’s approach fixes more concretely upon scriptural authority and hearing the Word of God, whereas Coakley’s approach ranges widely to “dark corners” and disciplinary conversation partners as ways of jarring the spiritual status quo of Christian intellectual life. That principled difference is ultimately rooted in a different notion, it seems, of the character of God and the consequent covenantal shape of ordered life with God for those human creatures who participate by grace in the full life that is his alone by nature. Might we even say that Webster’s approach offers a divinely provided and ordered means of ongoing ascetical discipline, by means of the Reformed Scripture principle, which is only somewhat contingently matched by Coakley’s dependence upon intellectual scavenging for unsettlement? Might it be the case that dogmatics actually offers a sustained and structured approach to intellectual asceticism that outpaces the desires of even a <i>théologie totale</i>? We do well to attend to some principles for such a path forward by way of conclusion.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz200-9">Dogmatics serves discipleship, governing the intellectual life (as with the bodily and relational facets of human existence) by the Word of God. Frequently, contemporary theologians have estimated dogmatics impotent to such ends and have felt the need to enlist other disciplines as ancillaries, handmaids, or, perhaps at times, tutors to school dogmatics in its ethical responsibilities. So we do well to conclude with some principled theses for <span id="z201-6">how such a dogmatics might undertake its labors, aware that it must remain earnest at all times lest it drift from a posture of faith into an arrogance of sight and of closure. Four concerns deserve our consideration: the Trinitarian matrix of ascetical dogmatics, the perfection of God and its formative shape in giving birth to the Reformed Scripture principle, the relationship of contemplation and radically anti-speculative theology, and the difference between intensive and extensive (or interdisciplinary) theology.</span></p>
<p id="pz201-7">First, an ascetical dogmatics must be grounded in the biblical Trinitarianism of the catholic creeds if it is to be a protocol of God’s grace, flowing from his own triune perfection and unto self-displacing and renewing discipline, rather than from a posture of self-mastery, accenting our autonomous intellectual projects. Here we need not deny what is affirmed by Coakley, though we must walk back some of her suggested negations and contextualize her account to make it serviceable. Remember that she has argued in favor of an incorporative approach to the Trinity rooted in Romans 8 over against the linear structure, which she deems to be founded in Johannine Trinitarianism and developed later in the official creedal texts of the fourth century. Again, such claims are not an analytic commentary on implicit judgments but are her own explicit statements regarding what is to be affirmed, what must be denied, and where they are both rooted in Scripture and tradition. She does note that “distinction between the two models is not necessarily absolute,” but she speaks only of the negative potentiality of the linear model.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_51" id="ttf_15_51">51</a></sup> Why does she go this route? The incorporative model draws us into the very life of God through prayerful incorporation of the human self and their desire into the triune movement, specifically through the reflexive posture of the Spirit. The linear model involves a hierarchical approach that invariably minimizes the Spirit’s role of return unto Father and Son.</p>
<p id="pz201-8">A classical account of the Trinity might affirm the incorporative work of the Trinity and might show its eternal roots by locating it amidst the so-called linear model which Coakley denies. Indeed, the linear model shows that the missions of Son and Spirit are rooted in God’s own life (<i>theologia</i>) and not merely express some economic reality (<i>oikonomia</i>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_52" id="ttf_15_52">52</a></sup> That the Spirit flows forth or proceeds eternally from the Father and [through] the Son (<i>filioque</i>) serves to root the spiritual ascent of humans ultimately <span id="z202-6">and eternally in God’s own being and action, willed from all eternity. Such claims do not undermine the economic reality of spiritual incorporation—far from it—for their purpose is to characterize and specify such ascent as truly willed by the one true God according to triune order befitting and expressive of God’s eternal character.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_53" id="ttf_15_53">53</a></sup> Still further, Matthew Levering helpfully reminds us that incorporation cannot be an undifferentiated experience. As he says, “The emphasis on the order of origin—on the Father begetting the Son and the Father (and Son) spirating the Spirit—enhances the incorporative model by showing us that our unexpected entrance into the divine life means not pure relationality but an ordered relationality.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_54" id="ttf_15_54">54</a></sup> Incorporation occurs through the Son by the Spirit; even Coakley’s preferred passage in Romans 8 manifests a precise concern to offer what can be deemed prepositional theology, and these distinct prepositional monikers mark out a specific order (<i>taxis</i>) to the divine economy and its attendant spiritual implications for human incorporative ascent.</span></p>
<p id="pz202-7">Why is this pertinent here? Why are such matters of triune being and action pertinent to a discussion of dogmatics as ascetics? Why do they in any way relate to the question of whether dogmatics can sustain a self-renunciatory pattern of intellectual discipleship? Trinitarian order helps displace the self-directed approach to God in one’s own manner.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_55" id="ttf_15_55">55</a></sup> God defines the terms of approach. Just as the God of Israel sketches the contours of holiness by which priests might enter his presence in the book of Leviticus, so the Trinitarian logic of the Gospel according to John and of Romans 8 provides a paradigm fully of God’s design for covenant life with him. Union and communion with God occur by our desire, but only secondarily, for God has first desired or elected life with us. Further, this incorporative ascent occurs only by his design and as revealed in his own triune self-disclosure. The transcendentals might be pursued in various modes; the idol might be approached willy-nilly; the triune God, however, brokers only one pathway into his presence. Much more could and should be said here regarding displacement via dogmatic discipline—for instance, <span id="z203-6">to take up Otto Hermann Pesch’s terms, that a dogmatic theology will not sacrifice existential concern in its pursuit of sapiential ends, but will pursue existential discipline and grace precisely in and by the discipline of a decentering vision that Pesch terms sapiential.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_56" id="ttf_15_56">56</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz203-7">By enabling wisdom (<i>sapientia</i>), reduction (<i>reductio</i>) of one’s presenting concerns to theological <i>principia</i> serves not only intellectual but ascetic or self-displacing ends.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_57" id="ttf_15_57">57</a></sup> Augustine of Hippo infamously taught that we may enjoy (<i>frui</i>) God and must use (<i>uti</i>) all other things and then nuanced his distinction, in a positive rhetorical way, to help us sketch what it means to love God for his own good and to love all else for God’s own sake, thus avoiding idolatry.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_58" id="ttf_15_58">58</a></sup> In other words, in loving other persons or goods, we must love them in such a way that we still love God and that our fulfillment of the second facet of the great love commandment does not negate the ever-looming command of its first facet. To honor this distinction demands resolute discernment. Henry Chadwick observed, “In ‘correct use’ there is an implication of reflective detachment, whereas by contrast what is enjoyed is all-absorbing.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_59" id="ttf_15_59">59</a></sup> That use of other goods is not merely detachment from them, but reflectively or intentionally (even if subconsciously) suggests the need for intellectual formation. Formation in tracing all things back to God helps one discern what is itself divine and worthy of enjoyment in and of itself and, by contrast, what deserves love only for its use unto love of God. Dogmatics, then, reduces all things unto God that we might know when and how to love rightly. In Paul’s terms, “the renewal of your mind” leads to moral discernment of that which is “good and acceptable and perfect” (Rom 12:2).</p>
<p id="pz203-8">Second, the perfection of God serves a fundamental role not only in <span id="z204-6">identifying God but in rooting the ordered form of God’s sanctification of human reason and demonstrating that we are disciplined by direction unto the very means of our intellectual-spiritual discipline in Holy Scripture, as our only final authority in his fatherly hands. In other words, the doctrine of God is not only a doctrine of God but of God’s works, which include the way in which God puts to death and makes alive human reason. The Reformed Scripture principle serves a pivotal role here in Webster’s own theology that is unmatched by the prolegomenal materials marshaled by Coakley, and this shapes the eschatological and ascetical vigor of the two accounts.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_60" id="ttf_15_60">60</a></sup> Whereas she turns to “dark corners,” he calls for a focus upon the light of the written Word.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_61" id="ttf_15_61">61</a></sup> Verbal descriptions of theology, then, must note the way in which it follows always responsively to God’s revelation: “theology as holy reason finds its completion in such acknowledgment and indication.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_62" id="ttf_15_62">62</a></sup> Verbs matter, and we must observe that “acknowledgment” and “indication” are not akin to the far more active verbs of contemporary intellectual culture, especially in its activistic register. Yet these verbs season the language of Zion, of a people who have been illumined from outside and led from on high through the murky and dangerous wilderness. The people of God are decentered by the life-giving agency of the God who takes center stage.</span></p>
<p id="pz204-7">A deeper point ought not be missed either, namely, that the Reformed Scripture principle flows from a radicalizing of the catholic doctrine of divine perfection as applied to our intellectual provision. Christians have for centuries attested God as the perfect one, fully sufficient in and of himself. The Reformed tradition has not augmented or supplemented of those claims; rather, it consistently applies God’s triune fullness to the whole of theology. Indeed, Herman Bavinck argued beautifully that the varied distinctives of Reformed theology can, each in their own way, be related or traced back to a fundamental radicalizing of divine fullness, which he terms its “root principle.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_63" id="ttf_15_63">63</a></sup> Note that Bavinck is not arguing for a so-called “central dogma” from which we might somehow logically deduce attendant doctrinal claims. <span id="z205-6">The nineteenth-century typologies that suggested a Reformed rooting of all dogma in predestination, perhaps over against a Lutheran rooting in justification by faith alone, mangle not only the architectural shape of Reformed dogmatics but also the varied seams connecting one piece to another. Yet Bavinck is right to note that an unstinting perception of God’s fullness, his perfection, what might be termed his self-sufficiency and immensity, has shaped the way in which the many works of God are viewed. Each of them flows from and manifests the God who has all within himself; none, therefore, marks out a terrain wherein God is completed, augmented, supplemented, corrected, or even approached from without.</span></p>
<p id="pz205-7">A doctrine of divine perfection has been matched, of course, by an attendant participatory construal of creaturely reality and of human moral agency. Some Reformed theologians—not least John Webster—have been leery of the language of participation. Their concern, as stated pointedly at times by Webster, was that participation is easily heard in ways that elide the profound distinction between created and uncreated being.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_64" id="ttf_15_64">64</a></sup> Over against participation, then, language of covenant fellowship was often suggested as a means of affirming a dogmatics of divine perfection that did not cease to be truly ethical and to give real legitimacy to human moral responsibility. Affirming Webster’s worry without necessarily following his terminological hesitancy, I think we can appreciate how creaturely being participates in the perfect God’s life and how that participatory fellowship is ordered according to the biblical categories of covenant.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_65" id="ttf_15_65">65</a></sup> Webster and the Reformed tradition make a much bigger deal of divine perfection—and its other related divine attributes—than does Coakley, in whose volume they receive no focused attention. And a corollary, I believe, is a similar focus upon participatory rest being covenantally ordered and, as structured by God’s lead, as shaped authoritatively by scriptural guidance.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_66" id="ttf_15_66">66</a></sup> We have seen <span id="z206-6">then two principles regarding how the doctrine of God shapes the principles of an ascetical dogmatics, corresponding to the Trinitarian order and the perfect character of the God of the gospel. We must now turn briefly to two corresponding anthropological principles, pertaining to the ends and the manner of such a dogmatics.</span></p>
<p id="pz206-7">Third, an ascetical dogmatics walks the careful line of pursuing contemplative ends while maintaining a radically antispeculative posture. Metaphysics serve contemplation, even as exegesis shapes metaphysics.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_67" id="ttf_15_67">67</a></sup> We must clarify, therefore, the two ways in which theology can be speculative, only one of which is salutary. Katherine Sonderegger has helped greatly in this regard.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_68" id="ttf_15_68">68</a></sup> Early in the first volume of her systematics, we encounter the claim that “metaphysical claims about Oneness and idolatry go together.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_69" id="ttf_15_69">69</a></sup> One might think that this would prompt a protocol of specification for the sake of avoiding idolatry, commending a theology with strict contours and sharp edges so as to avoid veering into paganism. Without detracting from edges and specifications, Sonderegger points to a more startling reality: the call to honor the divine mystery. “Divine mystery is not a sign of our failure in knowledge, but rather our success. It is because we know truly and properly—because we obey the axiomatic First Commandment—that we can know God as mystery. His metaphysical predicate of Oneness, when known, yields mystery.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_70" id="ttf_15_70">70</a></sup> Elsewhere the point is repeatedly pressed home that mystery is an intellectual achievement flowing from divine presence, not a limit owing to divine absence.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_71" id="ttf_15_71">71</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz206-8">Radically antispeculative theology rooted in exegesis of the scriptural testimony of the triune economy generates the focal point of such contemplation of the divine mystery. Mystery does not equal abstraction in the sense of nonspecificity. Mystery relates to the supersaturated shape of the divine self-revelation in the full scope and sequence of biblical attestation. Contemplative theology attends to the “whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:27), tracing or reducing all topics back to their end in God without <span id="z207-6">becoming speculative in any unloosed manner but remaining tethered to the canonical form of spiritual presentation. With Bavinck, we can attest, “Mystery is the lifeblood of dogmatics. . . . In truth, the knowledge that God has revealed of himself in nature and Scripture far surpasses human imagination and understanding. In that sense it is all mystery with which the science of dogmatics is concerned, for it does not deal with finite creatures, but from beginning to end looks past all creatures and focuses on the eternal and infinite One himself.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_72" id="ttf_15_72">72</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz207-7">Fourth, dogmatics fixes its eyes intently upon a very limited set of resources, providing a lens whereby Christians might then engage other intellectual sources. Dogmatics is not an interdisciplinary activity in the sense of connecting Christian theological analysis with that of other fields. Such work is not illegitimate; intellectual conversation proves essential on many fronts, for Christ is Lord of all, and his children are called both to learn of him from his book of nature as well as his apostolic emissaries (Ps 19) and to seek the welfare and benefit of spheres beyond the churchly (Jer 29:5–7).</p>
<p id="pz207-8">Sarah Coakley’s project may seem resolutely theological, in that its presenting problems (all in the realm of sex, gender, and self) are resourced by averting attention toward church fathers, biblical exegesis, and congregational fieldwork. But it is worth noting the kind of attention given here. Kevin Hector has commented that “the idea here, again, is that theologians are constantly tempted to self-deception, bias, partiality, and so forth, and that they can effectively resist such temptations only on the basis of a sort of principled interdisciplinarity, the aim of which is to force oneself to remain open to other points of view, to loosen the grip of one’s prejudices and presumptions, and, in sum, to make it more difficult for one to see objects as corresponding to one’s desire-inflected preconceptions of them.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_73" id="ttf_15_73">73</a></sup> One can perhaps appreciate the method by considering the two facets of “sanctity of mind” in Thomas Aquinas that are highlighted in Bauerschmidt’s apt study: “Thomas’s particular sanctity of mind combined both intellectual openness and unswerving evangelical purpose. Thomas believed in following arguments where they led, but he also believed that truthful arguments could never lead us away from Christ.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_74" id="ttf_15_74">74</a></sup> Coakley’s project does not seek to shirk Christ, of course, though it is arguable that her first volume’s focus <span id="z208-6">on intellectual openness, both to many extracanonical discourses as well as to a strand of canonical reasoning found in Romans 8, leads to a loss of that evangelical purpose (exemplified so by her shirking of the witness of Johannine Trinitarianism). Here we surely have Christ with extension, but I fear we may also have only a Christ without absolutes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_75" id="ttf_15_75">75</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz208-7">Again, in the realm of interdisciplinary attempts to stave off self-satisfaction in the status quo, Trinitarian matters are not far from the surface. Eugene Rogers asks, “Is the Christology to be all eschatological, all in what the Spirit will work, and not historical, in what the Spirit has already conceived? Perhaps Coakley will say that only after we train our eyes to see Christ in our neighbor are we really able to see Christ anew in Jesus.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_76" id="ttf_15_76">76</a></sup> Coakley has responded that the delay of a proper Christology is intentional, and that “my main interest in vol. 1 is deliberately to destabilize any complacent sense that we can get our hands around ‘Jesus’ without prior pneumatological displacement.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_77" id="ttf_15_77">77</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz208-8">One element here is that her interdisciplinary effort to hear the Spirit in various discourses raises the question of targets and of breadth. Has she listened in the right places? And has she listened widely enough?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_78" id="ttf_15_78">78</a></sup> Truthfully, I am not sure how such questions could ever be satisfied given her protocol. But a more fundamental question raised by Rogers haunts more profoundly: can we really expect to hear the Christ of Scripture only after hearing the Spirit in his world? Is this not exactly the reverse of what Calvin taught regarding the need for a scriptural set of lenses through which we might glean how the whole world serves as a theater of God’s glory?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_15_79" id="ttf_15_79">79</a></sup> Why would we expect and structure our theological approach to “pneumatological displacement” around nontheological theories or disciplines? Why the focus on “dark corners” and distant lands rather than illumined hallways and the churchly homestead? A more densely developed Christology and pneumatology would provide resources for a more intensive focus, I think, <span id="z209-1">upon Holy Scripture and, subserviently, upon the church’s attention to that revelation in her witness and wisdom, from which we can then turn to assess the illumination thrown on all the world as God’s own theater (as suggested by Calvin’s favored image).</span></p>
<p id="pz209-2">In sum, I hope that this sketch of the terrain and these brief theses help suggest that the seemingly establishmentarian might just be the most eschatological, for dogmatics serves within the triune economy, by God’s mortifying and vivifying grace, to discipline our minds and hearts. Not burning down the house, in a fit of vibrant revolt, but finding the fire of the tabernacle to light our very minds unto holiness. Dogmatics does so precisely by decentering our own presenting questions and assumptions, reducing all data and questions unto the triune God. Such intellectual discipline, however, demands a careful walk toward contemplative wisdom rooted in a radically antispeculative approach to biblical reasoning. While dogmatics shapes and forms one to engage in interdisciplinary reasoning and extensive conversation, the discipline itself fixes its sights upon a certain set of divinely gifted resources and angles of inquiry.</p>
