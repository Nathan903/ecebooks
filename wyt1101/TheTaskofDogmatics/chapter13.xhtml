<h2 id="pAJ3y">I<span class="smallcaps" id="Ah7v">NTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pAOcH">My purpose in this essay is to proffer a constructive proposal in response to the question “what is the dogmatic task?” while keeping an eye on the question “what is dogmatics?” My program is to probe resources in Karl Barth’s consideration of the matter in his <i>Church Dogmatics</i>, especially his ruminations in I/1. Barth offers a number of ideas on the nature of dogma and the relation this has to the person of Jesus Christ. For Barth, so I will <span id="z163-6">exposit, the Word of God makes the talk about God found in church proclamation true. However, this relation—this truthmaking relation—is often vaguely stated. Thus, I will adjoin this reflection to some considerations of truthmaker theory in an effort to answer the headlining questions. However, let me register a caveat at the outset: this is not an adventure in the exegesis of the Swiss theologian’s corpus. What I offer is a constructive proposal that is <i>Barthian</i>—as in, Barth-inspired—that may or may not be specifically <i>Barth’s</i> proposal. That being said, I hope that my analysis and the conceptual tools I bring to the task may along the way illuminate Barth’s thought in a manner that is helpful to Barth devotees. In simple terms, the picture I paint holds dogmatics to be a discipline dedicated to making distinctions. Dogmatics analyzes church proclamation to the end of discerning those elements of church proclamation that are made true by the Word of God and thus properly categorized as dogma.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_2" id="ttf_13_2">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz163-7">In order to exposit the dogmatic task, I first lay out some definitions and distinctions with respect to key terms in the project. In fact, a bulk of the project is simply getting clear on just what those components to the concept of dogma are. These terms are drawn from Barth’s reflection in the <i>Church Dogmatics</i>. This is followed in a second part by a presentation of pertinent aspects of truthmaker theory. Along the way, the principles from truthmaker theory are applied to the terms defined in the previous section, the execution of which pushes our understanding of the nature of the dogmatic task to a deeper level. Finally, once these conceptual pieces are in place, I offer some concrete suggestions for how the dogmatic task—as it is here conceived—may be accomplished in the church in the here and now.</p>
<h2 id="pz163-8">T<span class="smallcaps" id="Arhl">ERMINOLOGICAL AND</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="Aga5">ONCEPTUAL</span> F<span class="smallcaps" id="AoZH">OUNDATION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz163-10">Like many before me, my first distinction is that dogmatics is but one component of theology. “Theology” is a wild and wooly term whose wooly-ness we theologians regularly encounter during our first lecture in an intro-course. Many of us gesture toward something like breaking theology down etymologically and calling it the study of God or, more Barthian, <span id="z164-6">talk about God. But of course talk about God can occur in various and sundry times and places. Barth himself holds that the church talks about God (a) “by its specific action as a fellowship,” (b) “in proclamation by preaching,” (c) “the administration of the sacraments,” (d) “in worship,” and (e) “in its internal and external mission,” which includes “works of love amongst” (i) “the sick,” (ii) “the weak,” and (iii) “those in jeopardy.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_3" id="ttf_13_3">3</a></sup> For my purposes I will hold that when talk about God occurs in (b), (c), and (d)—that is, preaching, sacraments, and worship (what I will exposit as the paradigmatic locus)—this talk about God is properly <i>church proclamation</i>.</span></p>
<p id="pz164-7">Barth is unfortunately vague about his definition of church proclamation, although he does say that it is “primarily and decisively preaching and the sacraments.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_4" id="ttf_13_4">4</a></sup> However he also goes on to state that “the task but not the reality of proclamation may be reduced and restricted to these two categories of preaching and sacrament.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_5" id="ttf_13_5">5</a></sup> Barth does not give necessary and sufficient conditions for church proclamation. Neither am I going to do so. Rather, I want to point to a paradigmatic locus of talk about God: the Sunday morning worship experience that countless Christians have participated in—and continue to participate in—on a weekly basis across time and place. In this context, instances (b), (c), and (d) are most clearly seen. I think it ought to be remembered that for the vast majority of the faithful, their experience of theology is not through academic texts, or theology conferences, or in the seminary classroom. Rather, for good or for ill, the lion’s share of the faithful’s theology comes from what they experience on Sunday morning. I do not rule out other related loci for church proclamation, say a Wednesday evening Bible study, or a wedding, or an evensong, or a Billy Graham crusade. These other instances simply highlight the archetypal nature of the Sunday morning experience.</p>
<p id="pz164-8">Barth asserts that not all talk in the church’s worship, my paradigmatic case, seeks to be church proclamation. He says, “It does not seek to be such when it is talk addressed by man to God,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_6" id="ttf_13_6">6</a></sup> such as prayers, songs, or confession. Neither, I suppose, would Barth include in church proclamation such instances of talk about God on Sunday morning as when a music minister starts extemporaneously talking about God during a slow song, when the pastor welcomes new attendees telling them that God is pleased they are there, or the “meet and greet” time when the congregation is to say hello <span id="z165-6">in the name of the Lord. None of these instances, so far as I can tell, would clearly count as church proclamation in Barth’s mind. However, I find this unnecessarily restrictive as a definition of church proclamation. By and large, people—the faithful and unchurched alike—come to the Sunday morning experience expecting God to be the subject of communication. That this communication occurs by way of the sermon, the sacraments (if celebrated), the liturgy (by which I just mean “what goes on in the service”),<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_7" id="ttf_13_7">7</a></sup> the architecture, the music, the lighting, the candles, or the video screen is of no consequence. Although the sermon and the sacraments are the principle loci of talk about God, there are a myriad of other elements of the service that speak volumes about the God Christians are purporting to worship. So, for me, I will simply define church proclamation as every aspect of the Sunday morning experience—in its entirety—that communicates about God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_8" id="ttf_13_8">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz165-7">Before moving on from the definition of church proclamation, I offer a brief note on who is doing the proclaiming in this picture that I am sketching and this foreshadows some of my practical application points to come. Although Barth holds that the task of proclamation is only indirectly assigned to the church in general, he avers that the question of dogmatics is “aimed first and directly at those entrusted with the task of proclamation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_9" id="ttf_13_9">9</a></sup> Yet, it seems to me a simple fact of the matter, that in modern Sunday morning experiences “those entrusted with the task of proclamation” are not just senior pastors or teaching pastors or the like—as Barth likely had in mind. It is not just the person preaching that day or administering the sacraments (if they be administered) who issues church proclamation in the sense I am understanding it. Rather anyone who plays a liturgical role is being entrusted with the task of church proclamation. These leaders may be the music minister and the band, the choirmaster and the choir, the readers of Scripture, or even, in some churches, the videographer, the <span id="z166-6">creative team, and the soundboard technician. All who communicate about God in the paradigmatic case are participating in church proclamation and thus are subject to having their communication treated by the dogmatician.</span></p>
<p id="pz166-7">That was church proclamation and who does it. The next key term I want to discuss is the contentious word “dogma.” Barth works to describe in <i>CD</i> I/1 an older definition of dogma that has been, to his mind, corrupted by the Roman Catholic tradition. Yet, this older tradition is in line with what he wants to say about dogma. Let me offer a smattering of quotations from Barth, which will highlight some Barthian themes that I will appropriate in my own conception of dogma. Barth writes, “The true content which is sought [by Christian talk about God] we shall call dogma”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_10" id="ttf_13_10">10</a></sup>; “Talk about God has true content when it conforms to the being of the Church”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_11" id="ttf_13_11">11</a></sup>; “the dogma which dogmatics investigates is not the truth of revelation, it aims at the truth of revelation”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_12" id="ttf_13_12">12</a></sup>; and again, “Dogma aims at the truth of revelation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_13" id="ttf_13_13">13</a></sup> We have here a cluster of concepts and terms and their relations to one another: “true content,” “truth,” “conformity,” “aims,” etc.</p>
<p id="pz166-8">This cluster leads to three important characterizations of the concept of dogma. Dogma, as I offer it, is a term that denotes success, relation, and category. Let me corroborate these characterizations with some Barthian evidence. On success, Barth says, “Dogma is the agreement of Church proclamation with the revelation attested in Holy Scripture.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_14" id="ttf_13_14">14</a></sup> I take “agreement” to be a term of success. On relation, Barth specifically states, “Dogma in the true and original sense as the epitome of all dogmas and dogmatic propositions is a concept of relation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_15" id="ttf_13_15">15</a></sup> Finally, we can discern two categories in this enterprise: one for those instances when the agreement relation successfully obtains, and one for those instances when it does not. Hence, those instances of church proclamation that successfully bear the appropriate relation are properly categorized as dogma. I will have much more to say about the nature of this relation further on, but first we must pivot to how these preliminary explications of the concepts of church proclamation and dogma lead to a definition of <i>dogmatics</i>.</p>
<p id="pz166-9">Dogmatics, then, as noted before, is a distinction-making discipline that categorizes the various aspects of church proclamation into dogma <span id="z167-6">and nondogma. “As a theological discipline,” Barth headlines, “dogmatics is the scientific self-examination of the Christian Church with respect to the content of its distinctive talk about God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_16" id="ttf_13_16">16</a></sup> The dogmatician inspects what has been offered in church proclamation to discern when it does or does not bear the appropriate relation. Hence, in light of this, dogmatics is an inherently reactionary discipline. As Barth states, it “follows the talk of the Church,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_17" id="ttf_13_17">17</a></sup> coming after the fact to differentiate all that is communicated concerning God in the paradigmatic case. Dogmatics is but parasitic on church proclamation. You just cannot do the distinguishing work of dogmatics without the “raw material” of church proclamation to divvy up or differentiate into dogma and nondogma. But the good news is, as long as church proclamation occurs, the dogmatician has a job to do. Like the Lord’s mercies, the raw material the dogmatician works with is new every (Sunday) morning. Even though dogmatics is primarily reactionary, I will sketch below a way it can be a proactive servant as well.</span></p>
<p id="pz167-7">That dogma is a success term indicates that it denotes a category of church proclamation that bears an appropriate relation. Clearly we must understand what this relation is, and what the relata are, if we are to know when success occurs and thus what is in the category of dogma. Barth uses a number of terms for this relation, his favorite of which is “agreement” (<i>Übereinstimmung</i>). This relation is the “<i>agreement</i> of the Church’s distinctive talk about God with the being of the Church”;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_18" id="ttf_13_18">18</a></sup> “Dogmatics is the critical question about dogma, i.e., about the Word of God in Church proclamation, or concretely, about the <i>agreement</i> of the Church proclamation done and to be done by man with the revelation attested in Holy Scripture”;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_19" id="ttf_13_19">19</a></sup> “The task of dogmatics is the examination of Church proclamation in respect of its <i>agreement</i> with the Word of God”;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_20" id="ttf_13_20">20</a></sup> “dogma is Church proclamation that is really in <i>agreement</i> with the Word of God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_21" id="ttf_13_21">21</a></sup> A clearer picture of the relation begins to emerge. On one side of the relation is church proclamation, what I understand as all aspects of the Sunday morning experience that communicate about God. The relation is, in Barthian terms, “agreement.” And finally the other side of the relation is “the being of the Church,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_22" id="ttf_13_22">22</a></sup> <span id="z168-6">which, according to Barth, is “identical with Jesus Christ.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_23" id="ttf_13_23">23</a></sup> Thus, finally we can deploy a fuller Barthian definition of dogma: dogma is church proclamation in agreement with Jesus Christ. The task of dogmatics, then, is to distinguish those instances of church proclamation that are actually in agreement with Jesus Christ from those that are not.</span></p>
<p id="pz168-7">Have we come to the end of our analysis? I think not. I think that there are depths of explanation still to be plumbed. For just how are we to understand this agreement relation? And how are we to understand this relation when one <i>relata</i> is communication about God and the other <i>relata</i> is an entirely different category, a person, Jesus Christ the eternal Word of God? Here is where I think pivoting to truthmaker theory can assist our depth-plumbing.</p>
<h2 id="pz168-8">T<span class="smallcaps" id="AImNf">RUTH</span>-B<span class="smallcaps" id="Arzf">EARERS</span>, -M<span class="smallcaps" id="A5s-cb">AKERS</span>, -M<span class="smallcaps" id="A6rr">AKING</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz168-9">Like my Barthian description of dogma, a standard account of truthmaker theory, say Armstrong’s,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_24" id="ttf_13_24">24</a></sup> makes a tripartite distinction into two <i>relata</i> and a relation in the truthmaking situation: (a) the truthbearer, (b) the truthmaker, and (c) the truthmaking relation. As with anything in philosophy, the natures of these three entities are hotly contested. Instead of just expositing these notions independent of the task at hand, in what follows I will walk through these entities and along the way apply them to the dogmatic context.</p>
<p id="pz168-10">The majority opinion among truthmaker theorists is that truthbearers are propositions. I think this is a fine way to go and can easily be adapted for church proclamation, as I am here understanding it. When the preacher ascends to the pulpit and says to the congregation, “Jesus Christ is God and a human being,” the preacher utters a sentence that communicates a proposition about Jesus Christ, namely &lt;Jesus Christ is God and a human being&gt;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_25" id="ttf_13_25">25</a></sup> Countless other propositions are communicated as well by the preacher in the preaching activity. These propositions are the bearers of truth value. Of course, propositions can bear a false truth value as well.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_26" id="ttf_13_26">26</a></sup> <span id="z169-6">A propositionalized instance of church proclamation has a true truth value when it meets the conditions I will sketch below, and when it does so, it is categorized on my Barthian schema as dogma.</span></p>
<p id="pz169-7">But, recall, I want to understand church proclamation as all instances of communication about God during the Sunday morning experience. I stated that I think many of these instances are not limited to the sermon. Rather, there are numerous communications about God that take place in and through countless utterances, actions, and gestures of the worship time. What I think needs to be specified is that while not all communication about God in church proclamation comes in the form of propositions, all communication about God can be propositionalized.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_27" id="ttf_13_27">27</a></sup> When the priest elevates a consecrated piece of bread and the kneeling congregation crosses themselves, with bells ringing and incense wafting, this is not a proposition, yet to the observer these actions communicate a proposition like &lt;The bread of the Eucharist is the body of Jesus Christ&gt;. This proposition would then constitute an instance of the raw data that the dogmatician would categorize into dogma or nondogma.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_28" id="ttf_13_28">28</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz169-8">So (a) the truthbearer in dogma is a propositionalized instance of church proclamation. Within the Barthian dogmatic framework, as we saw above, what makes it such that an instance of church proclamation is dogma is its agreement with or conformity to Jesus Christ. Thus, within the truthmaking explication, the truthmaker is none other than the eternal Word of God, Jesus Christ himself.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_29" id="ttf_13_29">29</a></sup> This fits well with the truthmaker theorists’ standard concern to maintain a cross-categorical relation between truthbearers and truthmakers. Typically, whereas truthbearers are propositions, truthmakers are not; they are some other ontological entity. Take the proposition &lt;there is at least one human&gt;. This truthbearer is made true by some nonpropositional entity like Socrates, Plato, or Oliver Crisp. What is helpful about the truthmaking motif for our purposes—in distinction <span id="z170-6">from a general correspondence theory of truth—is the manner in which a one-to-one correspondence is not required for truthmaking. That is, a truthbearer can be made true by multiple truthmakers, or inversely, one truthmaker can make true multiple truthbearers. For &lt;there is at least one human&gt; is made true by Socrates, Plato, and Oliver Crisp. But Socrates makes true multiple truthbearers, such as &lt;there is at least one human&gt; or &lt;there is a human named “Socrates”&gt;. On the Barthian framework I am sketching, one truthmaker—namely, the Word of God—is the truthmaker for all the true truthbearers of church proclamation.</span></p>
<p id="pz170-7">Within the analysis of dogma and dogmatics, the Barthian conception of (c) the truthmaking relation is one of “agreement” (<i>Übereinstimmung</i>). But what could this be? First, we must note that there is no consensus in the truthmaker literature as to just what the truthmaking relation is. Entailment, supervenience, dependence, grounding, or others are all candidate concepts for this relation. These terms attempt to characterize the nature of an <i>in-virtue-of</i> necessitation relation between truthbearers and truthmakers. So how is a Barthian-inspired concept of agreement going to do the work of the in-virtue-of relation that links truthbearers and truthmakers?</p>
<p id="pz170-8">Actually, I want to hold that question to the side for a moment to first raise a potential worry regarding (b) the truthmaker as Jesus Christ. In addressing that worry, I hope to add some greater clarity to (b) which will allow me to specify what is going on in (c) the truthmaking relation.</p>
<h3 id="pz170-9"><i>A W<span class="smallcaps" id="ATdj">ORRY</span> <span class="smallcaps" id="AadC">ABOUT</span> (<span class="smallcaps" id="AmyV">B</span>)</i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz170-10">Timothy Pawl writes, “According to Truthmaker Theory, truthmakers must <i>necessitate</i> the truth of the propositions they make true. . . . If David Armstrong is a truthmaker for the truth, <i>that David Armstrong exists</i>, then in any world, at any time at which David Armstrong exists, the proposition <i>that David Armstrong exists</i> is true.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_30" id="ttf_13_30">30</a></sup> The idea here is that in every possible world where a truthmaker exists, the truthbearers that are made true by that truthmaker are true. According to traditional Christian theism, the eternal Word of God, the second person of the Trinity, exists in all possible worlds.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_31" id="ttf_13_31">31</a></sup> God is a necessary being, and all three members of the Trinity are necessary. There is no possible world in which the Word of God fails to exist. Yet, traditional Christian theism also holds that at least some if <span id="z171-6">not most of the propositions that might constitute an instance of church proclamation are not necessary, they are contingent. This latter notion is a safeguard for divine aseity and the doctrine of creation <i>ex nihilo</i> is a means for doing this safeguarding. God was free to create the cosmos or not, the Word was free to become incarnate or not, God was free to appear to Moses on Mt. Sinai or not. Barth is representative of the Christian tradition in holding that all these acts that God did perform are free, gracious, and contingent actions. Thus, a proposition like &lt;God the Father Almighty is the creator of heaven and earth&gt; is a contingent truth. Yet, if this proposition is a truthbearer necessitated by the Word of God, and if the Word is necessary, then the proposition &lt;God the Father Almighty is the creator of heaven and earth&gt; is true in every possible world. But this means that God was not free not to create. And it appears as though we have arrived at a contradiction in combining the notions that at least some of the propositions of dogma are contingent while the truthmaker of dogma is necessary. We could hold that (i) all dogmatic propositions are necessary, (ii) the Word of God is contingent, (iii) the whole Barthian dogmatic picture is hopeless, or we could (iv) modify (b) so as to include an element of contingency. Barth hints in the direction of (iv), and thus I will pursue that route.</span></p> <br/> 
<h3 id="pz171-7"><i>“. . . <span class="smallcaps" id="AqWb">TO</span> M<span class="smallcaps" id="AsBH">AN</span>”: T<span class="smallcaps" id="AAGS">HE SECOND</span>-P<span class="smallcaps" id="A-eR">ERSONAL</span> N<span class="smallcaps" id="AuQD">ATURE OF</span> (<span class="smallcaps" id="ATWy">B</span>)</i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="ApoE">Although the second person of the Trinity is necessary, the Word’s actions are not. This in fact is just what the freedom of the Word consists in, the Word’s only contingently doing some things, such as becoming incarnate or speaking and revealing God to humans. This is what I think Barth is focusing on when he describes the Word of God as that in virtue of which church proclamation is true. That is, (b) is not simply the person of Jesus Christ; we need to hold that (b) is more specifically Jesus Christ as and in a free, gracious, contingent act of revelation, reconciliation, and address. Let me offer some textual support to corroborate this claim.</p>
<p id="pz171-8">For instance Barth writes that dogmatics “makes the assumption as in and with the Church it believes in Jesus Christ as the revealing and reconciling address of God <i>to man</i>.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_32" id="ttf_13_32">32</a></sup> Likewise, he says, “The criterion of past, future, and therefore present Christian utterance is thus the being of the Church, namely, Jesus Christ, God in His gracious revealing and <span id="z172-6">reconciling address <i>to man</i>.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_33" id="ttf_13_33">33</a></sup> And further, “We accept and shall continue to accept the incomprehensibility of the fact that the Word of God is spoken <i>to man</i>.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_34" id="ttf_13_34">34</a></sup> For Barth, the situation is not just that the eternal Word of God is the truthmaker for dogma; rather, it is the Word of God <i>in act</i>, the Word of God performing the actions of revealing to, of reconciling with, of addressing humans. The truthmaker is the person of the Word plus the accidental or contingent feature of the Word’s freely acting. The mixture of a contingent feature categorizes the truthmaker itself as contingent, and thus a truthbearer necessitated by such a truthmaker is also contingent. Which is what we want for the truths of dogma.</span></p>
<p id="pz172-7">Let us take an example. Suppose we think of the proposition &lt;there is an author of this paper&gt;. I am the truthmaker for that truthbearer. But suppose we make this proposition of a more second-personal nature, &lt;I wrote this paper for you&gt;. The truthmaker for this proposition requires an entity, a person—me—plus some free, intentional activity—my performing the act of writing to you. I <i>simpliciter</i> am not the truthmaker for the proposition &lt;I wrote this paper for you&gt; in the way I am for the proposition &lt;there is an author of this paper&gt;. Instead, the truthmaker for &lt;I wrote this paper for you&gt; is me plus some accidental, contingent, intentional activity.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_35" id="ttf_13_35">35</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz172-8">A similar analysis, I think, obtains for the Barthian conception of dogma. The truthmaker for dogma is not just the Word of God; it is the Word of God plus the free, contingent, and intentional activity of addressing humans. What is more, on the Barthian scheme, the situation is not even so vague as to hold that the Word is addressing humans in general or an abstract notion of humanity. The situation is much more concrete than that. As the above-quoted selections indicate, Barth holds that the second-personal activity of the Word revealing, reconciling, and addressing humans happens every time there is veridical dogmatic church proclamation. Every time the preacher ascends to the pulpit and speaks forth church proclamation, it is only dogma if the Word of God, the agential person of Jesus Christ, grounds those propositions by a free and discrete act of revelation, reconciliation, and address to those concrete, specific humans gathered together <span id="z173-6">in the paradigmatic locus. This is a lively, dynamic, new every Sunday morning state of affairs that matches the way the preacher, addressing the congregation’s side of the bridge, has to work with a shifting target. Now, I do not think that this at all means that the Word is shifting and changing such that in one congregation the Word will make it true that &lt;Jesus Christ is God and a human&gt; and in the next sermon the Word will make it true that &lt;Jesus Christ is only a human&gt;. Rather these same propositions, given the second-personal restriction, need to be revealed by the Word <i>to</i> the congregation newly, freshly, and diversely.</span></p>
<p id="pz173-7">Hence, while the truthmaker for church proclamation includes a necessary component—the Word of God—it also includes a contingent element—the free activity of the Word. This renders dogma contingent as well, and the potential contradiction noted earlier is avoided.</p>
<h3 id="pz173-8"><i>B<span class="smallcaps" id="AdyA">ACK TO</span> (<span class="smallcaps" id="ATGp">C</span>)</i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz173-9">As I have modified (b) slightly to show the truthmaker in the dogmatic situation to be not just Jesus Christ, but Jesus Christ in a free act, now we can reengage with (c), the “agreement” truthmaking relation. Recall that what we are looking for is an understanding of the <i>in-virtue-of</i> relation between the propositions in church proclamation and Jesus Christ in free act. Simply put, a dogmatic proposition agrees with Jesus Christ’s free act, when Jesus Christ is actually freely acting to communicate that proposition to specific persons at a specific time. A dogma-truthbearer is true in virtue of the Word’s free activity of address to the recipients of the dogmatic propositions. This then serves to both ground or link the dogmatic propositions to the Word and preserves the Word’s agential freedom. Dogma, then, means the free, revealing, reconciling, addressing act of Jesus Christ directed to specific individual humans. And the dogmatic task is to discern those instances of success or failure, when dogma does or does not obtain.</p>
<h2 id="pz173-10">P<span class="smallcaps" id="Af3a">RACTICAL</span> A<span class="smallcaps" id="AZeo">PPLICATION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz173-11">I want to conclude with some comments on a practical application of the foregoing reflections on the nature and task of dogmatics. It would seem very odd indeed to spend a whole paper probing the connection between church proclamation and dogmatics without offering some serious visions about how to go forward in real life. So let me offer two practical suggestions to the practitioners of dogmatics, one hinted at by Barth and one, I think illegitimately, downplayed by him.</p>
<h3 id="pz174-6"><i>P<span class="smallcaps" id="AUgK">REACHING</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz174-7">I want to probe a reflection here on where the frontline of dogmatics actually is. For it seems to me, if the picture I am painting of the dogmatic task in relation to the overall mission of theology is apt, then the frontline of dogmatics is the pastor’s study. The frontline is not in the academy or the seminary, the frontline is not at AAR/SBL, it is not in Durham, North Carolina or Durham, England. No, rather, the frontline of dogmatics is every single Monday through Saturday when pastors across the country and across the globe sit at their desks, open the Bible, and ask themselves, what am I going to say this week?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_36" id="ttf_13_36">36</a></sup> Thus, the first area of practical application is in the realm of preaching. Barth repeatedly incites dogmaticians to ply their craft on the preaching of “to-day and yesterday.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_37" id="ttf_13_37">37</a></sup> I want to suggest that the dogmatician concern herself not just with an abstract notion of the sermon yesterday and today, but more concretely with the sermon last week and next. It is last week’s sermon or next week’s that is the tangible locus of the dogmatic task, where the activity of distinguishing those propositions that have been or will be communicated into dogma or nondogma based upon their agreement with the Word of God occurs.</p>
<p id="pz174-8">Church proclamation builds a bridge from the acting Word of God—the freely revealing, reconciling, and addressing person of Jesus Christ—to the present congregation. The target, the congregation, is always moving because the concerns, interests, deficiencies, and needs of a congregation are, again, like the Lord’s mercies, new every (Sunday) morning. Likewise, the manner in which the propositions of dogma are communicated can vary greatly. Similar to the manner in which multiple truthbearers can be made true by one truthmaker, multiple sentences—or acts of communication—can express one and the same proposition. A propositional truthbearer like &lt;God the Father Almighty is the creator of heaven and earth&gt; is intentionally revealed by the Word of God, but the means of communicating that proposition are legion. The preacher can utter, “Our heavenly Father is the source of all that the empirical sciences will ever investigate, and so much more!” Or, “Look at all this stuff around you. Without God, there wouldn’t be a single thing here!” Or, “Like a painter before a blank canvas, God creatively painted the picture of the world . . . plus God made the canvas and all the paints.” The dogmatician works with the raw data <span id="z175-6">of church proclamation, discerns the proposition it attempts to communicate, and then distinguishes this proposition into dogma or nondogma. However, even as I noted that Barth thinks dogmatics “follows the talk of the Church,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_38" id="ttf_13_38">38</a></sup> as a reactive enterprise, I suggest here that it is better to be a proactive dogmatician than a reactive one.</span></p>
<p id="pz175-7">Those who preach on a regular basis, or even on an irregular basis, know that the majority of time spent “sermonizing” is not the fifteen, twenty, or forty minutes on Sunday morning when the sermon is delivered to the congregation, but the fifteen, twenty, or five hours spent Monday through Saturday (or in the wee hours of Sunday morning) figuring out what to say to the people come Sunday morning. Ideally, the dogmatician has a standing midweek meeting with the preacher where one is able to speak to the issues of the sermon of last week, but more importantly one works with the preacher in preparation for the sermon of next week (or in the weeks to come), distinguishing what in that potential church proclamation is dogma and what is not.</p>
<p id="pz175-8">Allow me a brief “sermon” illustration. I have a very good friend who is an associate pastor at a large Baptist church. He preaches a few times a year, and it is common for us to have phone conversations as he prepares for a sermon. We discuss exegesis of the passage he is preaching on, the theology embedded therein, what the needs of the congregation are at the time, and what his sense of the Holy Spirit’s leading is for that week. I do not pretend that I am a better exegete than all the commentaries he has access to, nor that I am a better repository of theology than Barth or Aquinas or Calvin, but I am there in real time, in dialogue, and in relationship, assisting him in his work of preparing to speak church proclamation to his people in the here and now. My role, as a sort of dogmatic midwife, is to help him in his sermon give birth to dogma. The Barthian-inspired dogmatician likewise can come alongside the preacher to serve in the task of proclaiming dogma.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_39" id="ttf_13_39">39</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pz175-9"><i>L<span class="smallcaps" id="A_tvj">ITURGICS</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz175-10">Secondly, I turn to liturgics.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_40" id="ttf_13_40">40</a></sup> The dogmatic task is to help church proclamation to be dogma. Barth rightly pinpoints the primary locus of this talk <span id="z176-6">about God in preaching and the administration of the sacraments. I agree with placing preaching and sacraments as primary, but I want us not to underestimate the power that liturgy plays in being church proclamation. Here again, the frontline of the dogmatic task in this sphere is not just the sixty to ninety minutes of the service on Sunday morning. Rather, at this point, depending on the context, the frontline moves out of the preacher’s study and into the staff meeting room, or into the worship pastor’s study, or into the music minister’s head. There are innumerable ways that one talks about God in the countless decisions that go into putting together the Sunday morning worship service. All this communication about God has the potential for being dogma, true truthbearers in mediating the active presence of the person of Jesus Christ, but they also have the potential for being nondogma. I want to commend to dogmaticians to develop the proficiency for being able to distinguish that which is done on Sunday morning outside the sermon as bearing the truth of the Word of God or not. Dogmaticians can then encourage their pastors (or others on the pastoral staff) to work toward the increasing of those elements of the service that bear these truths and decreasing those that do not. Does the use of a fog machine communicate dogma? Does the distortion on the Fender advance propositions that are grounded in God? Does the incense or video bumper or candles or PowerPoint agree with the Word of God? If what I am sketching is apt, dogmaticians cannot simply hand the liturgy over to the musicians or the videographer or the soundboard technician or the sacristan or the verger, well-meaning as they are. No, like the dogmatician serves the preacher in preparation for the sermon, the dogmatician likewise serves the music minister or creative team or worship team in the preparation of the liturgy.</span></p>
<p id="pz176-7">However, let me highlight here that the Barthian model cannot advocate for a calcified conception of liturgy. The congregation is an ever-evolving, ever-moving target for church proclamation. Like the skilled preacher, the skilled liturgist—assisted by the skilled dogmatician—discerns both shores that the bridge of church proclamation spans in order to successfully put the congregation in contact with Jesus Christ the truthmaker. What is attractive, and challenging, about the Barthian motif is that there is not a woodenly rigid answer to any liturgical question. It might very well be that in bridging the worlds of the revelation of Jesus Christ and the context in which that revelation is communicated, fog machines are the perfect church proclamation to do so. In other contexts, if the liturgist wants to use smoke to communicate about Jesus Christ, incense is the apropos <span id="z177-1">means. In either context, the dogmatician assists the liturgist in making this decision based on the active Word of God, not merely pragmatics or convenience or cool-factor.</span></p> 
<h2 id="pz177-2">C<span class="smallcaps" id="Ay7L">ONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz177-3">Talk about God occurs all over the place. When that talk about God occurs in the paradigmatic locus of the Sunday morning worship experience, that talk is church proclamation. Although church proclamation occurs primarily in preaching and the administration of the sacraments, it also occurs throughout the liturgy, in word, gesture, and song. When those instances of church proclamation are made true by a free act of address by the Word of God to the congregation, they are categorized as dogma. Thus, the dogmatic task is to distinguish when this does and does not happen. However, rather than being purely reactionary, I implore dogmaticians to take a proactive-servant role in their churches working with preachers and liturgists (of all kinds) to ensure that the church proclamation of next week is indeed dogma.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_13_41" id="ttf_13_41">41</a></sup></p>
