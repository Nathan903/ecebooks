<p class="noind" id="pAulY"><i>M<span class="smallcaps" id="A2cX">YSTERY</span></i> <span class="smallcaps" id="AtfFc">AND <i>MIST</i> ARE NOT COGNATES</span>! Our weak eyes cannot gaze too long at the high mysteries of the Trinity, the incarnation, or God’s love, just as they cannot the sun at midday: too much light and no mist at all! Some mist, however, inevitably reduces our perception of many of the objects of revelation, as long as our earthly pilgrimage lasts. Only, too much mist is not necessary.</p>
<p id="pz107-6">Now, mist unduly thick (sometimes fog and smog) hovers on the way one tries to articulate the permanent validity of propositions (in a broad, <span id="z108-6">nontechnical sense, e.g., statements, assertions, theses, the central content of speech-acts, etc.) with their being bound to and affected by particular contexts. The French philosopher Paul Ricœur signaled the difficulty: “How can we speak of the <i>truth</i> of an explanation if significations are contextual?”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_2" id="ttf_11_2">2</a></sup> “Contextual” implies specific times and places. Many, it appears, feel uneasy as they face the question: How should our theology combine “truth” and the participle normally translated “present” (<i>parousē</i>), as 2 Peter 1:12 freely does?</span></p>
<p id="pz108-7">I hope to thin the mist, as an evangelical theologian (standing under Scripture), not as an anthropologist or as a linguist (I claim no expertise in their fields) but as a theologian looking for clarifications.</p>
<p id="pz108-8">The issue, as I see it, has been most sensitive on three fronts:</p>
<p id="pz108-9"><i>Roman Catholic theology</i> has had to wrestle with the development of dogma. Could it show the legitimacy of apparent changes in the course of time? For centuries, it prided itself of the <i>semper eadem</i> note of the church (“always the same”). It applied confidently the so-called “canon <i>lerinense</i>,” (that is, of Saint Vincent de Lérins): the catholic faith is what was believed of all, always and everywhere. (Actually, this was a veiled attack on Augustine’s radicality.) Catholic polemics used the canon against the “variations” of the Protestant churches, as in the learned and painstaking volumes from Bossuet’s pen (more than 1,000 pages).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_3" id="ttf_11_3">3</a></sup> But the new sense and valuation of temporality in the second modernity—becoming preferred to being—and the rise of critical historiography have led to a reversal. John H. Newman pioneered a new treatment. The ability to bring forth new fruit became the sign of life. This outlook gained the ascendancy, and Vatican II was seen as its victory. Yet the claim has been maintained that continuity had been safeguarded. The permanent validity of the main magisterial pronouncements has been upheld, both in official discourse and by most influential theologians.</p>
<p id="pz108-10">Tensions there have been, and the evolution has been rather slow, even in recent decades. Compare two Vatican documents entitled <i>Mysterium</i>: Paul VI’s <i>Encyclical Mysterium fidei</i> (1965) stipulates in §24, concerning dogmatic <span id="z109-6">formulas, that “they express concepts which are not tied to a certain form of culture,” and are therefore “understandable by men of all ages and places.” On the contrary the 1973 declaration <i>Mysterium Ecclesiae</i> underlines that “they may bear the mark of the conceptions of their time.” Bernard Sesboüé, to whom we owe the quotation, comments, “This affirmation introduces a new element . . . what is being expressed may include ‘marks,’ i.e., obsolete elements bound to mutable conceptions.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_4" id="ttf_11_4">4</a></sup> Sesboüé and his famous predecessor and fellow-Jesuit Karl Rahner, whose acute perception of historical conditionings is well-known, stand as major Catholic witnesses of theological work on our topic.</span></p>
<p id="pz109-7"><i>Missiology</i>, Roman Catholic but also evangelical, has grown more and more appreciative of the diversity of cultures. Missionaries have tried to escape the charge of cultural imperialism and ethnocentricity, levelled at former missionary styles. Contextualization has become the rallying cry (“inculturation” among Catholics).</p>
<p id="pz109-8">Not without controversy, many evangelicals were concerned that permanent validity could be jeopardized. Charles Kraft’s bold proposals aroused a great stir. Matthew Cook, a representative missiologist today, still complains that “dynamic equivalence” in Kraft’s manner “demands dropping the text down into its equivalent cultural function.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_5" id="ttf_11_5">5</a></sup> “Dynamic equivalence” alludes to <i>translation</i> theory. Not seldom, and with good reason for doing so, the focus has been on the translation model. A tongue or idiom characterizes a cultural context, and, since William Carey, translating the Bible has been recognized as the first task to be accomplished by evangelical missionaries! With so pregnant a model, linguistic science and even philosophical views of language have been invited to share in theological debates.</p>
<p id="pz109-9">The third front is broader: ideological, philosophical—the front of the contemporary “culture war” in our Western democracies. <i>Late modernity</i> shows a majority distrust of “grand narratives” (the phrase coined by Jean-François Lyotard) and wishes to deconstruct universal claims. (I say “late modernity,” sometimes “modernity-post,” to ward off the false suggestion <span id="z110-6">of a radical and wholesale discontinuity with modernity.) Perhaps the trend is starting to ebb, but it is still being felt. Situatedness, practically synonymous with “contextual relativity,” is the strident slogan. “If modern theology sought a universal view from nowhere,” Kevin Vanhoozer writes, “the first principle of postmodern theology is ‘location, location, location.’ The situatedness of the theologian trumps his or her supposedly neutral methodology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_6" id="ttf_11_6">6</a></sup> Since it renounces universal moorings, it can hardly prevent an “ethnification of theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_7" id="ttf_11_7">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz110-7">One meets all degrees of radicality. Extreme (lucid?) forms flatly deny any permanent validity to doctrinal statements. Milder forms face the problem on our table.</p>
<h2 id="pz110-8">T<span class="smallcaps" id="A9AT">WO</span> P<span class="smallcaps" id="A0ZM">ILLARS</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz110-9">It is mpossible to ignore the strong cases one can make for both assertions—that propositions remain valid forever if ever valid and yet that they are relative to their contexts. They stand as two solid pillars, erected on rational and <i>biblical</i> grounds.</p>
<h3 id="pz110-10"><i>P<span class="smallcaps" id="A75M">ERMANENT</span> V<span class="smallcaps" id="AL8j">ALIDITY</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz110-11">Truth remains truth: such has been the Christian and human conviction through millennia. Even today, it may pass for “common sense.” We see it operative in the reactions of the very prophets and priests of its denial. Though far from conservative, but sober and honest, Paul Ricœur could confess: “Truth, finally, cannot be multiple without denying itself. The True and the One are interchangeable notions.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_8" id="ttf_11_8">8</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz110-12">The boomerang argument against skepticism and relativism—you are sawing the branch on which you are seated—has received no answer. Neither has the “no way logically to stop” criticism. Abraham Kuyper, for instance, complained that skepticism “undoes all sense of solidity. Once you begin to slide down that slope, there is no stopping.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_9" id="ttf_11_9">9</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz111-6">And there is the scent of sophistry one smells in the dialectic of more than one relativist defense. Hear what special pleading Alexandre Kojève—no mean thinker, the father of the Hegelian revival in France in the mid-twentieth century—offered to prove the Hegelian tenet that <i>truth itself changes with time</i>: “Let us suppose,” he wrote, “that a poet, in the Middle Ages, had written in a poem: ‘At this moment, a man is flying above the ocean.’ Undoubtedly, it was an error, and it remained an error for centuries. But if now we read again that sentence, chances are that we read a truth, for it is almost certain that at this moment an airman is flying above the Atlantic.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_10" id="ttf_11_10">10</a></sup> We are not far from the way Eubulides, the Megarian philosopher, claimed he could destroy all certainty: “Don’t you know the man under the blanket? No, I can’t see him! Then, you confess that you don’t know your own brother [Orestes]!”</p>
<p id="pz111-7">Yet a serious question arises worth pondering: why are skeptics so <i>little</i> moved by rebuttals?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_11" id="ttf_11_11">11</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz111-8">Not only common sense, but “canon sense”!<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_12" id="ttf_11_12">12</a></sup> Scripture <i>massively</i> witnesses to the blessed immutability of God and the permanent validity of his Word. The Lord is the rock, in sharp contrast with the fickle nonentities invented and worshipped by the nations. He is the Rock of Ages, <i>tsur ‘olamim</i> (Isa 26:4), who changes not. While stars, which the ancient admired as divine powers for their perfect regularity, do exhibit variation (<i>parallagē</i>), he never does (Jas 1:17). As he does not “repent” as mortals do, as he cannot deny himself and cannot lie, his words remain valid. “Validity” applies both to the true and to the good, to norms that rule thinking and doing, faith and practice; validity corresponds to the nuance of Aramaic <i>qesheh</i>, truth. The Hebrew word <i>’emeth</i> approaches the meaning “stability.” One could speak of a conceptual contiguity, or even union, between truth and permanence, everlasting permanence. Psalm 119:160 mirrors the understanding, as does Jesus’s statement that his words shall never pass away.</p>
<p id="pz111-9">Could anyone explain away such an emphasis as a residue of an orientation <span id="z112-6">towards archaic timeless time, of the downgrading of motion and the mutation at mythical stages, or later, of Platonic influence? Not likely. It is part and parcel of the future-oriented and historical faith of both Old and New Testaments. God is the God of hope <i>because</i> his promise remains permanently valid. And this belief is not only expressed, it is put to practice: the New Testament use of the Old would be totally enervated if permanent validity were denied. No evangelical reader could find fault in Karl Rahner’s nonambiguous statement: “Revealed truth remains the same, remains ‘true’, i.e., it reaches the object [<i>die Sache trifft</i>] and is of binding authority in all ages.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_13" id="ttf_11_13">13</a></sup></span></p> <br/> 
<h3 id="pz112-7"><i>C<span class="smallcaps" id="AH16">ONTEXTUAL</span> R<span class="smallcaps" id="A8u_cb">ELATIVITY</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz112-8">The second “pillar,” similarly, would not be easy to pull down. Common sense has also recognized the importance of context. (I basically use “context” in the way that now predominates, for historical, social, cultural, situations; some say “co-text” for what was previously meant by the term.) Experience has bitterly taught humankind that you can secure the condemnation of any person if you take that person’s words <i>out of context</i>. One may discuss the validity of a proposition only within the parameters of the situation in which it was put forward; they determine what is being said.</p>
<p id="pz112-9">This conviction has been heightened, amplified, and sometimes radicalized with the rise of the “social sciences” (<i>Geisteswissenschaften</i>, <i>sciences humaines</i>). Emphasis has been put on the role of symbolic systems in shaping the mind-set of all in a given people group. Such systems are peculiar to communities and shape their identities; they are diverse as the communities are diverse; insiders learn them and interiorize them with language, so that they function, to a great extent, <i>unconsciously</i>. They beget the “natural” way of looking at things, of speaking and behaving. “Culturalism” has seen each culture as an independent whole, incommensurate with others—despite dismissal by foremost experts (Marcel Gauchet),<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_14" id="ttf_11_14">14</a></sup> it is still influential.</p>
<p id="pz112-10">Language represents a major dimension of culture.</p>
<p id="pz112-11">The arbitrary character of signs, especially lexical units, which Ferdinand <span id="z113-6">de Saussure, the founder of modern linguistics, highlighted,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_15" id="ttf_11_15">15</a></sup> supports the idea of cultures as discrete entities. If the same word means two different things in two languages—“Can I?” if mistaken for a French expression, <i>canaille</i>, will be understood “rascal”—and the same thing is referred to by totally different words (e.g., “dog” and <i>chien</i>), then the suggestion is that each language, a key determination of context, is a self-contained system. Any statement using this language is enclosed in the system and therefore tied to context.</span></p>
<p id="pz113-7">Does “canon sense” rule out what common sense seems to accept? By no means. Scripture is heedful of cultural and historical diversity. It makes room for linguistic plurality: it is even unique in this! The theme is central in the Babel story, and the intention of the Genesis 11 narrative is complex. On the one hand, those recent interpretations which read into the text their own glorification of dispersion and difference must be firmly resisted: too much ideology! The play on the name <i>Bàvèl</i> with the root <i>bll</i>, “confound,” flings an ironic dart at Babel (Babylon), the archenemy through the whole Bible: it shows that the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD</span>’s action implies judgment. On the other hand, one can discern in that judgment a merciful protection against a <i>worse</i> evil, against the dehumanizing success of a totalitarian empire.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_16" id="ttf_11_16">16</a></sup> Hence the retrieval—the redemption—of linguistic plurality in the gift of Pentecost, and the celebration of Revelation 5:9 (7:9).</p>
<p id="pz113-8">Scripture knows of contextual relativity. Changes, in time, of divinely authorized norms and practices is clearly taught and accepted. The Christian freedom regarding the external (fleshly) institutions of the Old Covenant—also enjoyed by believers of Jewish descent—is most spectacular. General statements such as Colossians 2:17 (they must be seen as shadows now fleeting) and Hebrews 9:10 (such ordinances were only to be observed until a time of reformation) underline their relativity to their location in history (<i>Heilsgeschichte</i>). Already in the Old Testament, one can see how the rules concerning sacrifices or marriage in the patriarchal age are no longer in force after Moses.</p>
<p id="pz113-9">When Peter unfolds the considerations that warrant his exegesis and <span id="z114-6">application—a rare thing in the New Testament, where they remain often implicit—he strikingly sets forth elements from David’s historical context to validate his interpretation of Psalm 16 (Acts 2:29ff.).</span></p> 
<h2 id="pz114-7">A<span class="smallcaps" id="ASRm">TTEMPTS AT</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="A1QJ">ONNECTION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz114-8">Both “pillars” stand. We do well to hearken to the Ecclesiastic voice at this juncture: “It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other” (Eccl 7:18). And yet, appropriate schemes that would connect the two with each other are not so easy to find!</p>
<p id="pz114-9">Perhaps the most common, quasi-spontaneous offer is the distinction of kernel and husk or, a little more refined (with a cultural component), of <i>body</i> (or a synonym) and <i>garb</i>. What is permanently valid is found under a superficial appearance; this appearance, being contextually determined or adapted, retains little or no value in itself.</p>
<p id="pz114-10">This scheme is severely criticized today. Although Matthew Cook can find several examples of competent scholars—still recently—making use of it,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_17" id="ttf_11_17">17</a></sup> it falls under heavy fire. It downgrades culture, it is claimed, which becomes a mere epiphenomenon. It falsely suggests that permanent truth can be expressed independently of culture, whereas the interpreter’s formulation is just as much cultural as the original one (the scheme is secretly rooted in imperialism). It relies on vague metaphors, with no explanatory power.</p>
<p id="pz114-11">One can notice, however, how persistently the aforementioned metaphors show themselves! Matthew Cook can write, “Any bifurcation of the supracultural minimalist kernel (proposition) and the cultural (read ‘disposable’) husk discards too much of the text at hand,” and can use the equivalent metaphor himself a few pages later: “There is no point where the naked supracultural proposition(s) are viewed in themselves. They are always clothed by some culture.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_18" id="ttf_11_18">18</a></sup> Benno van den Toren, with a critical intention, asks: “Can We See the Naked Theological Truth?”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_19" id="ttf_11_19">19</a></sup> Such a <span id="z115-6">master in the choice of words as J. I. Packer uses “to enshrine” for the particular tradition (and its “embodiment”), “to mesh” for the gospel with it, and “to unshell and repack” for the interpreter<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_20" id="ttf_11_20">20</a></sup>—each one a similar metaphor. Other instances would not be so hard to find.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_21" id="ttf_11_21">21</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz115-7">This warns us against triumphalism and may hint at that some stubborn element of truth lying hidden somewhere under such (admittedly too facile) figures of husk, garb, or wrapping.</p>
<p id="pz115-8">A second and typically modern choice finds permanent validity in the original writer’s “thrust,” while the contents of his beliefs and teachings are being relativized. Under the word “thrust” one is to think of existential decision, of patterns of subjective involvement. So argues an able and influential essay by Daniel von Allmen, whom D. A. Carson, with admirable acumen, takes to task.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_22" id="ttf_11_22">22</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz115-9">Sifting the still valuable “thrust” from the now obsolete contents of teaching leads interpreters, one may fear, into the temptation of arbitrariness; yet we grant that the question is relevant. What is essential and to be retained in a legacy: subjective attitudes, existential moves, or objective contents of teaching? When a “rebel” (Luther?) has founded a new institution, is one’s true faithfulness to rebellion or to institution (Lutheranism)? Choosing the former alternative is typically modern not only because of the romantic premium put on rebellion, but also because it confers supreme value on the individual’s move, the <i>exercise of freedom</i>.</p>
<p id="pz115-10">Choosing here between the alternatives cannot be severed from the primary and ultimate choice each person makes, for time and eternity, <i>coram Deo</i>. The decision proceeds from the very commitment of faith. It is a point of personal confession. My faith (I commit myself; here I stand) is worth nothing apart from its object, which/who transcends it. My faith is worth nothing as an existential determination; it reaches out to salvation because of the saving truth of its object. This is reflected in the acknowledged privilege of contents.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_23" id="ttf_11_23">23</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz116-6">The most attractive model is that of <i>translation</i>. It can boast of an early use by so distinguished a scholar as Lamin Sanneh.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_24" id="ttf_11_24">24</a></sup> It has biblical precedent. It benefits from a wealth of experience and from the fruit of theoretical pursuits.</p>
<p id="pz116-7">Despite clear-cut linguistic diversity, translation functions. Paul Ricœur rightly emphasized the fact that “translation exists.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_25" id="ttf_11_25">25</a></sup> George Steiner underestimates it: his refinement and his prodigious literary culture (in the old sense!) make him disregard, and despise, to some extent, the ordinary use of language, and they lead him to write: “<i>L’intraducibilità</i> is the life of speech.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_26" id="ttf_11_26">26</a></sup> Yet, he must admit: “We <i>do</i> translate.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_27" id="ttf_11_27">27</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz116-8">To Ricœur, this remains a paradox, since there is no “third language” to mediate between the original statement and its translation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_28" id="ttf_11_28">28</a></sup> (The discussion whether one can extract a “supracultural core” out of diverse cultures runs on parallel lines: this core corresponds to an expression of content or meaning which would not depend on any given idiom.)<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_29" id="ttf_11_29">29</a></sup> I dare suggest that Ricœur tends to exaggerate the difficulty since he does not take into full account the insertion of human speech in the real interaction of persons among themselves and in the world. The “third term” is found in the <span id="z117-6">cognitive and practical participation in reality through language. A greater dose of epistemological realism and a stronger emphasis on the referential dimension opens up the way to a solution of the “paradox.” Theologically, I would add: not only “in the world” but, whether acknowledged or denied, before and even in God, the absolutely real. All humans stand <i>coram Deo</i>; they live, and move, and are in him (Act 17:28). This ontological all-embracing context should not be forgotten when one inquires about the possibility of translation!</span></p>
<p id="pz117-7">Common presentations have seldom sounded such underlying conditions. The question of application to other components of contexts than language, and of criteria to be used, has generally been left in the shade. That weakness limits the helpfulness of the translation model.</p>
<p id="pz117-8">Roman Catholic theologians and official documents are prone to use <i>incarnation</i> as the model for “inculturation.” Characteristically, the Fourth Latin-American Episcopal Conference declared in its Santo-Domingo meeting (October 1992): “The analogy between the incarnation and the Christian presence in the social, cultural and historical context of peoples leads us to the theological perspective of the incarnation. The incarnation is a dynamic process which goes from the Gospel to the heart of each people and community, through the mediation of language and of accessible symbols received by the Church.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_30" id="ttf_11_30">30</a></sup> Not a few evangelicals follow suit.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_31" id="ttf_11_31">31</a></sup> Have they pondered the stakes enough?</p>
<p id="pz117-9">Suggestive analogies do catch our attention. Becoming “flesh” for the eternal Son-<i>Logos</i> implied being located in a particular context, with particular identity markers: he became first-century Palestinian Jewish flesh, with Aramaic (surely Hebrew and probably some Greek) as his linguistic medium. This central truth of the gospel surely bears upon our subject.</p>
<p id="pz117-10">Yet Scripture does not know of an “incarnation principle.” Incarnation is a unique event, in many respects unthinkable. How can one being possess two natures? A “nature” is everything one is and can be described as being (the <i>principium quo</i>, while the “person,” in the case of personal existence, is the <i>principium quod</i>, as medieval masters used to say). There is one nature per person. It is obvious. Only deity can rise above the constraints of that <span id="z118-6">definition. Only deity, and the unique relationship of deity to humanity, make possible what is impossible: for one person to be in two natures which remain distinct! It happened, and could happen, only once.</span></p>
<p id="pz118-7">We should keep on the alert when cheap rhetoric trivializes this uniqueness (I remember gratefully John Webster issuing such a warning at the April 2004 Wheaton College Theological Conference).</p>
<p id="pz118-8">The French missiologist Jean-François Zorn reminds us that extending incarnation to the whole world has been a Roman Catholic tendency which Protestants, standing on biblical ground, had to oppose.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_32" id="ttf_11_32">32</a></sup> In recent decades, representative Catholic theologians have softened, de-emphasized, and sometimes veiled the classical theme of the incarnation-continuing-in-the-church. As far as I can see, it has remained structurally determinative.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_33" id="ttf_11_33">33</a></sup> If heirs of the Reformation maintain that it jeopardizes the New Testament <i>ephapax</i>, “once for all,” and unduly divinizes the community of Christ’s disciples, then they should beware of ways of speaking that suggest such a teaching; praiseworthy ecumenical goodwill and courtesy must not disarm discernment.</p>
<p id="pz118-9">Caution, therefore, advises against making incarnation the paradigm of contextualization and against making it a key conceptual instrument when one seeks to combine the permanent validity of doctrinal statements with their contextual relativity.</p>
<h3 id="pz118-10"><i>A F<span class="smallcaps" id="A_IM">EW</span> O<span class="smallcaps" id="AbQW">BSERVATIONS</span>: T<span class="smallcaps" id="AZcW">IMELY OR</span> U<span class="smallcaps" id="AQ2W">NTIMELY</span> (?)</i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz118-11">Proposed models fail to satisfy entirely, though it would be unwise to discard them—especially the “translation” one. Some observations may help us strengthen what has been offered so far, refine our grasp of the issues, purify, perhaps, our approach from useless or misleading presuppositions.</p>
<p id="pz118-12"><i>Beware of tropes</i>! When some phrases or ways of expressing a matter become very common, critical vigilance easily dwindles. If they belong to figurative speech (tropes), one runs the risk of forgetting that character and of drawing mistaken consequences from them (as if they could be taken literally).</p>
<p id="pz118-13">One often hears or reads, “We live in an entirely different world from the world of Abraham,” or David, or Calvin—even of Carl F. H. Henry for some. That consideration buttresses the call to contextualization: <span id="z119-6">propositions that were valid in Abraham’s, David’s, Carl Henry’s times urgently need recasting today. Now, the proposition about different worlds can be accepted as <i>hyperbole</i>. But <i>literally</i> it is by no means true to fact. We do live in the same world as Abraham did! When traveling in the Middle East, we cross the same valleys as he did, we drink from the same sources, we gaze upon the same stars, we breathe the same air as he did.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_34" id="ttf_11_34">34</a></sup> The same physical laws ruled the world millennia ago—and they must have some effect on ways of thinking themselves.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_35" id="ttf_11_35">35</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz119-7">Potent factors foster a misrepresentation of the actual case; they twist the picture out of proportion. Some factors are psychological, bound to modalities of human perception. One black spot on the white sheet catches our whole attention. What is common and regular is trite, uninteresting. It goes without saying—without being duly taken into account. Some factors are ideological. “Difference” has arisen on top of contemporary values, and universal claims are immediately suspect of imperialistic intentions.</p>
<p id="pz119-8">What’s the outcome? Common representations of human diversity ignore or minimize the constants and universals of the human condition. They are basic, and they regulate the human condition everywhere, but they escape notice. Leading anthropologists, as we mentioned earlier, have redressed the balance. Noted philosopher Charles Taylor offers a fine example of sounder procedure: “alternative possibilities” in various cultures are to be understood “in relation to some human constants at work in all.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_36" id="ttf_11_36">36</a></sup> And yet these commonalities remain commonly ignored. The truncated picture retains its hold on the general public and on the work of many thinkers. Common sense is to react. One should not, even, affirm constants and universals as a “supracultural” core. They are not above cultures (as if “culture” were to be <i>reduced</i> to difference), but the basis of all cultures, a main part in all cultures!</p>
<p id="pz119-9">Since language is such an important part of the cultural context, one may recall Chomsky’s generative grammar and its affirmation of underlying universal structures. Ricœur, a little reluctantly, grants the partial success <span id="z120-6">of Chomsky’s endeavor.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_37" id="ttf_11_37">37</a></sup> The French linguist Jacques Lerot boldly asserts, “Most concepts are the same or nearly the same in different idioms.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_38" id="ttf_11_38">38</a></sup> In his masterly synthesis on language, Vern S. Poythress upholds the universal perspective, though I wish he had highlighted it even more insistently.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_39" id="ttf_11_39">39</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz120-7">We may add a further methodological consideration. In this <i>abnormal</i> world, with the damages caused by sin and sin’s sequels, exceptions are not enough to refute universality. Clearly, we may count on a substantial measure of human commonalities to help us hold together universal validity and contextual particularity—not a desperate task.</p>
<p id="pz120-8">“Canon sense” brings a full confirmation. Scripture happily proclaims the unity of the whole human family. It emphasizes its one origin (Acts 17:26). It interprets the empirical sinfulness of all in terms of this origin and union “in Adam.” It sees all the various times of history under the Lord’s unifying sovereignty. One God—God of non-Jews as well as the God of Jews (Rom 3:29)—one world, one <i>anthrōpos</i>.</p>
<p id="pz120-9">Within the Bible, translation does not raise any problem of principle. It is naturally introduced in Nehemiah 8:7ff., the origin of targum in Jewish tradition. The idea of a normative human “nature” surfaces a few times (the most striking instance is provided by Rom 1:26ff.).</p>
<p id="pz120-10"><i>Beware of metaphors</i>. Metaphors are powerful among tropes, and some have exercised a major influence on majority thinking. Hans-Georg <span id="z121-6">Gadamer’s <i>horizons</i> have been granted the status of key categories. Has this been sufficiently guarded? Do horizons merge, melt, or fuse? Are there really <i>two</i> horizons with author and reader? Should not our “horizon” be what is revealed of God’s all-embracing design?</span></p>
<p id="pz121-7">The Greek neutral participle <i>horizon</i> means that which limits, a boundary. There is no access to what lies beyond the horizon. Does this apply to the human spirit in historical, social, and cultural “contexts”? Benno van den Toren, an apostle of contextualization, maintains, “All human thought is <i>rooted</i> in a particular cultural context but it is not necessarily <i>imprisoned</i> in that context.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_40" id="ttf_11_40">40</a></sup> Ricœur follows Descartes in his own way as he discerns some <i>infinity</i> in man’s “intention of truth.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_41" id="ttf_11_41">41</a></sup> Emmanuel Levinas, also in his own (most original) way, perceives a reference which goes beyond all horizon: “Having a meaning is taking a position respecting an absolute.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_42" id="ttf_11_42">42</a></sup> It could be described as Karl Rahner’s central conviction: “Human speech is, in advance, open onto the infinity of God (both naturally by virtue of its <i>potentia obœdentialis</i> and supranaturally by virtue of its being enunciated by the Spirit and raised to a higher level by the Spirit [in Scripture]).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_43" id="ttf_11_43">43</a></sup> Vern Poythress offers an exact wording: “Human beings have the ability to stand back from their immediate situation and look at larger wholes. They can even think about the whole of history,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_44" id="ttf_11_44">44</a></sup> and “We can in a sense ‘transcend’ the immediacy of our local situation and our small-scale use of language.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_45" id="ttf_11_45">45</a></sup> If the human heart was made for truth, for the fellowship of the God of Truth, with “eternity” engraved in its very constitution (Eccl 3:11), then we are warranted in affirming a kind of transcendence beyond all earthly horizons.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_46" id="ttf_11_46">46</a></sup> This undermines the logic which sees contextual relativity and permanent, universal validity as mutually exclusive.</p>
<p id="pz121-8">The metaphor of <i>perspective</i> must be handled with care. The younger <span id="z122-6">Edward Schillebeeckx wielded it as a tool to sap the permanent validity of dogmatic statements.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_47" id="ttf_11_47">47</a></sup> We can only see things from a particular perspective, and perspective depends on location, which is not the same for all—how could we require others to see things as we do? Here again, Ricœur was able to show himself (at least in 1960) remarkably sensitive to the claims of truth: “When I stand back, I do not institute a higher viewpoint, but I aim at truth without a point of view,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_48" id="ttf_11_48">48</a></sup> and even more pointedly, “How could I know a perspective, in the very act of perceiving, if <i>somehow</i> I did not escape from my perspective?”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_49" id="ttf_11_49">49</a></sup> One can argue that what we think and say (see?) from our limited point of view escapes relativism because it is grafted on the archetypal knowledge of him who has been described as “a sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere” (already quoted by Thomas Bradwardine).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_50" id="ttf_11_50">50</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz122-7">A rather persuasive appeal is made by the “postmodern” (modernity-post) party to yet another feature of the conditions of knowledge: the interrelatedness of everything. It apparently precludes the possession of any cognitive stability, and therefore rules out permanent validity. Poythress aptly replies that the remedy is found in the linkage of our knowledge to the knowledge of God, who masters all relationships.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_51" id="ttf_11_51">51</a></sup> This is fulfilled in redemption (fellowship restored) but based in creation, and remains basic for humanity. The privilege of being God’s image, the “metaphysical” framework it implies, is not simply annihilated as creation subsists in a corrupt and disrupted state. Owing to that creational dependency—which is not abolished when people deny it and sin against it—human knowledge is stable enough. Though partial and contingently conditioned, it still aims at truth.</p>
<p id="pz122-8">I would add that the truth of relation does not cancel the converse truth of singular identity. We must acknowledge the “granular” constitution of our world: the insight of the Greek atomists. Rain falls in drops, sand aggregates grains, reality is made of particles—I first met this observation in Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_52" id="ttf_11_52">52</a></sup> Creatures do not dissolve into waves inter<span id="z123-6">secting. God causes creatures with a distinct existence to stand before him with a stable <i>enough</i> identity. He shows that it is so by giving <i>names</i>. The supreme expression of this “law” of creation concerns the creature of God’s election and covenant. This creature is granted distinctive existence as an individual person—whom the Lord addresses, “I know thee <i>by thy name</i>.” In language, one may recognize a similar distinction of <i>words</i>. Against a tendency of structuralists, a tongue (Saussure’s <i>langue</i>) cannot be reduced to network, to systematic relationships. Ricœur was rightly led to affirm a “hard core” of meaning in lexical units.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_53" id="ttf_11_53">53</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz123-7">The area of my observations, ultimately, is the arena of the old mêlée of the <i>same</i> and the <i>other</i>, of being and becoming, of the legacies of Parmenides and Heraclitus, avatars of the one and the many. When one reads Karl Rahner, for instance, one is struck by his covert Heraclitean preference; when he characterizes history, he always implies a flux that ever brings up novelty, change ever changing.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_54" id="ttf_11_54">54</a></sup> He never critically scrutinizes this assumption. He never listens to the antagonistic accent of Ecclesiastes: nothing new under the sun!</p>
<p id="pz123-8">If they are treated as <i>principles</i> in the strong sense (absolutely primary) there is no hope of reconciliation. Actually, a lucid reflection realizes that one cannot <i>think</i> them together. A compromise such as Plato’s realm of ideas (as in the <i>Sophistès</i>) cannot be ratified. Only the foundation in God and his plan or design makes possible holding them together. I find Ricœur’s confession that he cannot account for the unity of history, once he has discarded the biblical “Plot of plots,” a most moving moment of his entire career.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_55" id="ttf_11_55">55</a></sup> We trust the Word of the Sovereign Lord, whose Trinitarian being grounds both unity and plurality and frees us from the antinomy of pagan (apostate) thought.</p>
<p id="pz123-9">Under the blessing of the revelation of God’s design, we may explore a little further what is meant by “contextual relativity.”</p>
<p id="pz123-10">Every speech-act is indeed located in time and space, and this <i>may</i> limit its intended import. It usually implies tacit references to elements of the situation and assumptions shared with the addressee. It often implicitly answers a prior question. It is free to select some aspects only of the matter <span id="z124-6">at hand. It chooses a language, with particular connotations. If the Benjamin Lee Whorf hypothesis about a specific worldview bound to a given idiom cannot be sustained (Ricœur, who also stresses, after Charles S. Peirce, the wonderful flexibility of language, discards with welcome clarity the hypothesis<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_56" id="ttf_11_56">56</a></sup>), worldview is involved in utterance.</span></p>
<p id="pz124-7">On the receiver side, similar contextual conditions operate—hence the suspicion that the proposition <i>as appropriated</i> is no longer the same as the proposition as uttered.</p>
<p id="pz124-8">This is not dramatically devastating for “permanent validity” if we consider (as was suggested) what is common to both situations, de facto translatability, and the “transcendence” of the human spirit. As Schleiermacher discerned, a common sensitivity (<i>Empfänglichkeit</i>) begets a marvelous sympathy between author and reader. Many do experience what Poythress describes, a figure of humility woven in the life of mind and soul: “The reader gives up the exclusive concentration on his own ideas, in order that another person’s ideas may prosper and momentarily have preeminence in the reader’s mind.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_57" id="ttf_11_57">57</a></sup> Transfer (the meaning of “translation”!) happily happens despite the losses it implies. Losses there are—they can be serenely borne if one remembers that language lives by approximation (I will soon come back to the point).</p>
<p id="pz124-9">I observe (and <i>this is decisive</i> in my opinion, and strategic in contemporary debates) that contextual relativity so described affects the <i>meaning</i> of the proposition or illocutionary act rather than its <i>truth</i> or ethical goodness. Truth/rightness/validity is acknowledged or denied, in a second move, through a judgment passed on the meaning once the meaning has been ascertained.</p>
<p id="pz124-10">If one then claims that <i>criteria</i>—indeed, there is no judgment without criteria—are entirely relative to the social, cultural, and historical context and that they are part of the “local” worldview as local, then he/she <i>imprisons</i> the person in their situation, an option we may confidently reject. Conditioning is obvious. The decisive word is “entirely.” If one maintains this “entirely,” permanent validity dissolves. There is no stopping on the slippery slope, and why should one debate anymore? I am afraid Ricœur himself, who was able to pen the fine statements quoted above, falls a prey to relativism when he suggests that no thinker can break free from <span id="z125-6">the <i>croyable disponible</i>, “what is available for belief,” in his or her time.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_58" id="ttf_11_58">58</a></sup> We do measure how formidable the effort to rise above the “plausibility structures” of one’s epoch must be, and our imagination reels when we realize our dependence on education, on peer-opinion, on information as “formatted” by media. But some men and women <i>do</i> shake off the chains (common grace also is at work), and an ultimate ability to resist the pressure must remain if accountability and truth-intention are to be preserved. The locus of decision can only be the deeper commitment of faith.</span></p>
<p id="pz125-7">One more remark on a common way of reasoning about contextualization should be critically assessed. Culture, commonly considered as context, is taken to be a well-circumscribed and homogeneous whole; it defines the people’s identity and utmost “respect” is due. However, this representation is woefully inadequate. A culture is rather an evolving conglomerate with qualitatively different, and often antagonistic components. It negotiates its continuity, in every generation, with outside influences. Material factors disturb precarious equilibriums.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_59" id="ttf_11_59">59</a></sup> The relationship of permanent validity to the various components of a culture cannot be the same!</p>
<p id="pz125-8">A pleasant alliteration runs through the elements to be considered in a culture: conduct, code, creed, and cult.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_60" id="ttf_11_60">60</a></sup> I select <i>code</i> (in a different acceptation of the term) and <i>creed</i> as the most relevant categories for our purposes. “Code” not only includes all semiotics systems and language, but also all the other regular correspondences between signifiers and signified (they are sometimes called languages in an analogical sense), all sets of symbols, and all meaningful gestures and attitudes such as the movements of the head to say “yes” or “no.” In its local peculiarity, code is arbitrary to a great extent, and its choices are basically <i>legitimate</i>. They do not raise the question of truth and ethical goodness. “Creed,” on the contrary, is made up of beliefs and value-judgments, which come under the qualifications of true and false, good or bad, valid or not (they do, Matt 12:36ff.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_61" id="ttf_11_61">61</a></sup>). There is <span id="z126-6">a kinship between the distinction of code and creed and the Saussurian one between <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i>,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_62" id="ttf_11_62">62</a></sup> or Noam Chomsky’s between “competence” and “performance.” Undoubtedly, there is in culture a vast expanse between the two poles of code and creed: the field of customs (one can think of the ways of cooking and table manners), preferences, and some priorities, which may have links with beliefs and ethical principles, but links so loose while human apprehension is so “rough,” <i>grosso modo</i>, that prudence recommends not to ask about truth and right (let insiders take the initiative!).</span></p>
<p id="pz126-7"><i>Worldviews</i>, on the contrary, are not immune from judgment. Amalgamated with other material, they embody the key beliefs and values, what people under their control think <i>true</i> and <i>right</i>. Creed indeed! When scholars give the impression that “local” worldviews should function as the norms of inculturation/contextualization, there is matter for concern.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_63" id="ttf_11_63">63</a></sup> Rather, they should undergo transcendent appraisal and reformation.</p>
<h2 id="pz126-8">S<span class="smallcaps" id="AHm8">KETCHING</span> T<span class="smallcaps" id="Adhd">ENTATIVE</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="AO_0">ONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz126-9">If some patches of unhealthy mist were dispelled, we may perceive, through the mist that remains, what can be concluded regarding our two “pillars” and the connections between them.</p>
<p id="pz126-10">May we say something solid and clear-cut regarding the “objective” pole of communication, the original speech-act—whether it reaches us in oral or in written form makes no radical difference? Common sense and, above all, “canon sense” allow us to affirm the permanent validity of propositions: once true or right, always so.</p>
<p id="pz126-11">Location, location, however! This applies to the meaning, the meaning <span id="z127-6">which is contextually identified. <i>If</i> the assertion or injunction was valid within the parameters of the original situation, which parameters forever define what was said, then it remains true/right/valid as such for thinkers of every age and place. This clarity disposes of the sophistry brought forward by the great Kojève: the statement “a man is flying above the ocean” belongs to its AD 1300 context. Whether explicitly or implicitly it is qualified by the clause “at the moment of utterance,” it remains true to this day that in AD 1300 no man was flying; its truth has not changed.</span></p>
<p id="pz127-7">The universal character of validity is grounded in the unity of monotheistic creation and history under God. God’s consistency in his words and in his works—he cannot deny himself—the role of the Son-<i>Logos</i> in whom all things hold together (Col 1:17, <i>synestēken</i>, the verb from which “system” derives), ensure that creatures form a universe. There is no <i>absolute</i> otherness in created being. We resist seductive Hegelian dialectics (which turns the negative into a principle, though it is circumscribed by the total becoming it generates) and irrationalistic “bragging,” such as San Pietro Damiani’s thesis that God can ensure that what happened did not happen (as Hegel also professed)—the medieval cardinal was proud to fight for faith with a donkey’s jaw-bone! We confess consistency and, therefore, permanent validity.</p>
<p id="pz127-8">On this basis, it is <i>possible</i> for a listener/reader/interpreter to overcome the difficulty caused by differences of context. An arduous task, in which failure remains a risk—<i>traduttore</i>, <i>traditore</i>—but not an impossible one. Readers/interpreters can <i>tend</i> towards that goal. Sympathetic relocation requires both information and an inner attitude of humble welcoming. It can bear fruit.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_64" id="ttf_11_64">64</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz127-9">Ambiguity unfortunately attaches to some statements in the literature. Benno van den Toren, while he valiantly defends that humans can access the supracultural kernel of the gospel, still concludes that “it is impossible to produce a formulation of the kernel of the Gospel always and everywhere valid.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_65" id="ttf_11_65">65</a></sup> Karl Rahner rightly reminds us that “the formula is never the thing itself” but adds that it “remains inadequate in respect to the thing.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_66" id="ttf_11_66">66</a></sup> “Adequacy,” I grant, may be used in slippery ways. I would reverse Ricœur’s choice of terms. He suggests that translation offers “equivalence” <i>without</i> <span id="z128-6">“adequacy” or “sameness.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_67" id="ttf_11_67">67</a></sup> I would question “equivalence,” in the strict sense of the word, but claim that translation provides an “adequate” access to the same meaning.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_68" id="ttf_11_68">68</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz128-7">The last point calls for some elaboration. For strict equivalence, no translation <i>equals</i> the original. The transfer is not complete; there is always a deficit. Connotations are lost like echoes, like a halo of shared memories. If some are added by a skillful translator, this is not translation proper. These additions constitute a new text that enriches the original one; it’s not a part of it. Adequacy means, however, that whatever is essential in the original word, the contents of the illocutionary act, does “come through.”</p>
<p id="pz128-8">Several considerations may be offered. The first would be the primacy of meaning in linguistic communication. The loss mostly concerns the emotive efficacy, the aesthetic enjoyment produced, though some translators are able of near-miracles in this regard. Not meaning. Language (speech activity), admittedly, fulfills other functions. But I suggest that they presuppose the communication of meaning: information on realities, expression, injunction, etc. (incidentally those overlap to some extent). I wish Poythress had made the privilege of meaning clearer.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_69" id="ttf_11_69">69</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz128-9">The loss mostly affects poetical and literary texts; I interpret in the light of this fact George Steiner’s celebration of <i>intraducibilià</i>. Attention for those features which, admittedly, are difficult to translate, receives texts as works more than words. Remember the meaning of <i>poièma</i>! Jean-Paul Sartre proved how sharp he could be when he wrote: “Poets are men who refuse to make use of language. . . . They consider the words as things and not as signs.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_70" id="ttf_11_70">70</a></sup> Although the Scriptures contain works of art, they wish to be received first and foremost as the <i>Word</i>, and doctrinal statements summarize the meaning-contents as the Word.</p>
<p id="pz128-10">A third reason why meaning suffers little in (a good) translation would <span id="z129-6">be because of the <i>grosso modo</i> functioning of natural language. “Fuzzy edges” is an apt metaphor for the way we handle concepts and words. Infinite precision is not human, whereas groping for words and more exact understandings, as Poythress powerfully stresses,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_71" id="ttf_11_71">71</a></sup> is human indeed!</span></p>
<p id="pz129-7">If we focus our attention on the “subjective” pole, that of reception and appropriation in other contexts, a <i>second</i> move is legitimate and normal. The first move, which we claimed was “not impossible,” is an empathetic and informed transfer to the birthplace of the text in order to ascertain its meaning there. Once this is done, one is in a position to ask about the bearing of the proposition in the interpreter’s context. Presumably, because of the interrelatedness of all situations in the one world of the one God, it has one. Creatures, being mirrors of the divine perfections, also mirror one another, and the meaning in the original context “reverberates” in others. One can speak of “significance” as distinct from “meaning,” of “application” after “understanding.” Permanent validity bears <i>relatively</i> new fruit.</p>
<p id="pz129-8">The enterprise is a venture. It must be done in the light of the biblical worldview. It should seek for cues in the biblical text and argue from analogy. Again, it is <i>not impossible</i>. It may imply changing emphases, adding complements, developing seed-thoughts to answer new questions. Whatever our evaluation of arguments set forth by Roman Catholic apologists in Newman’s wake (I am not convinced), we may admire their skill and personal honesty. We are to acknowledge for ourselves a broad margin of freedom in the reception of permanently valid propositions—when it is done in new contexts, with an eye to import and application.</p>
<p id="pz129-9">The <i>same</i> and the <i>other</i> hold together by virtue of the divine foundation. It will be rewarding for us finally to meditate on a question which we only touched upon: beyond the unified diversity of creation guaranteed by his design and government, how do permanent validity and ties to changeable contexts relate to God as he is?</p>
<p id="pz129-10">The Rock on which the first pillar is erected is nearly obvious. He is the immutable Rock of Ages. On his being, as he is, rest all stability and dependability that can be found—indeed, the validity of true propositions <i>semper et ubique</i>. The <i>’ekhad</i> of the confession: “Listen, Israel, YHWH our God, YHWH is one” (Deut 6:4),<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_72" id="ttf_11_72">72</a></sup> probably implies the qualitative oneness of the divine essence. The classical name for it is <i>simplicity</i>, if one accepts <span id="z130-6">the paradox (no cheap escape out of difficulty here) that simplicity may be affirmed together with the complexity of the multicolored riches of the wisdom of God and therefore of his essence. The supreme degree of unity—far above any unity in creatures, unity as fits the Absolute—is the perfection we confess. Saint Augustine was right when he repeated, as he was fond, the God <i>is</i> what he <i>has</i>. We should purge our worship of those anthropomorphic images of God as are current even among evangelicals, images of petty gods tailored to suit late modern wishes.</span></p>
<p id="pz130-7">Distinction, diversity, is no less primary and ultimate in the Trinitarian confession. Father, Son, and Spirit are, as such, absolutely distinct, more so than any creature from another. They are distinct not in essence, which exists only once as one God, but as subsisting relations (<i>relatio</i> is the Latin term which corresponds to the Cappadocian Fathers’ <i>schesis</i>). (No quaternity, however. It is essential for the divine essence to be possessed by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We should never separate them as we try to think along the lines of revelation.) As such, God’s being constitutes the root and fountainhead of all diversity in the world.</p>
<p id="pz130-8">The Trinitarian model may help us hold together the one and the many when meditating on divine eternity. Neither the merely one pure present (excluding the distinction of past and future) nor the mere infinite succession of the many moments whose union would be problematic. The God who is and who calls himself <i>’ehyeh</i> (Exod 3:14) is the God who is, and was, and is to come (an explanatory paraphrase of the Exodus name in Revelation 1:8). The Son, Jesus Christ, is the same yesterday, and today, and forever (Heb 13:8). Paradoxically again, the Rock is not immobile; he is the Living Rock, and Paul can strikingly write that he would accompany his people through the desert wanderings (1 Cor 10:4).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_73" id="ttf_11_73">73</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz130-9">We may thus celebrate the <i>life</i> of the eternal God as the source and warranty of meaningful history. The mystery of God, the mystery of all mysteries, emboldens us to confess “present truth.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_11_74" id="ttf_11_74">74</a></sup></p>

It can only be accepted as a provocation (Kierkegaard’s deeper intention, I believe, for he did subscribe to the creed). Biblically, <i>neither</i> of the two men is “in the truth.” Without subjective faith, the objective truth avails nothing, and remains a stranger to the person.

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ttf_11_39" id="pz120-13">39</a>. <span epub:type="footnote" id="ftt_11_39">I dare differ on a very minor point. In his zeal against reductionism, Poythress espouses Kenneth Pike’s “tagmemics” (<i>In the Beginning Was the Word</i>, 266, 337n22). He adopts Pike’s “emic” and “etic” categories, names which are derived from the words Phonetics (science of spoken sounds in their physical and physiological characteristics) and Phonemics (science of “phonemes,” linguistically significant phonological units that compose words). He explains: “Phonetics takes an outsider’s or foreigner’s point of view,” like a tape recorder, whereas in Phonemics, linguists “study sound from the insider’s point of view, by asking which sounds are perceived as making a difference” (151n3). He then affirms, “The particular genres in a particular culture are ‘emic’ categories, in the terminology of chapter 19. The commonalities shared by different cultures are ‘etic’ ” (196n3). I doubt the usefulness, and even the propriety, of the outsider/insider pair to differentiate between the phonetic and the phonemic levels; rather, Phonetics deal with sounds as phenomena of nature, and Phonemics as linguistic elements, that is, as <i>bearers of meaning</i>. This distinction is open to all, insiders and outsiders (only these do not reach the linguistic level, as long as they are ignorant of the language—as they do not know <i>tèn dunamin tès phônès</i>, as Paul says, 1 Cor 14:11, the meaning of the linguistic sign, as they cannot receive sounds as phonemes). One may encounter <i>phonetic</i> traits that are <i>peculiar</i> to a given people group. This is why adults are so often unable to pronounce the words of a foreign tongue though they know it well (there even seems to be differences in voice-texture). Conversely, <i>phonemes</i> only vary within limits and their diversity cannot be separated from universal conditions of human linguistic communication. “Genres” are rooted in these, “commonalities.” Poythress himself notes, with reference to Robert E. Longacre, that “narrative discourse in a broad sense is a linguistic universal, characteristic of all human language” (195n1; this rings truer to me than assigning Vladimir Propp to the <i>emic</i> particular category and Algirdas J. Greimas to <i>etic</i> universality, 201n13).</span></p>

In Greek, <i>glōtta</i> [<i>glōssa</i>] and <i>logos</i>; in Latin, <i>lingua</i> and <i>sermo</i> or <i>oratio</i>; in German, <i>Sprache</i> and <i>sprechen</i>, but some prefer other pairs, <i>Sprachtum</i> and <i>Sprechakt</i>, <i>Sprachgebilde</i> and <i>Sprechakt</i>, etc. In English, linguists do not agree; W. Baskin has chosen <i>language</i> and <i>speaking</i>, with <i>speech</i> or <i>human speech</i> for the vaguer and intermediate “language” in French.</span></p>
<p class="footnote"><a href="#ttf_11_63" id="pz126-13">63</a>. <span epub:type="footnote" id="ftt_11_63">Rahner, “Zur Geschichtlichkeit der Theologie,” 89, teaches that the translation of statements of faith must “conform [<i>konform werden</i>] to the prior horizon of understanding of the dialogue-partners” (he nuances, however, his surprising choice of the word “conform” [cf. Rom 12:2] at the end of his [long] sentence: the partner’s presuppositions have not been adequately reflected upon and their rightness has not been examined). He brands as theology’s shortcoming that it “does not take seriously the questions of the time, deep into its heart.” The emphasis is here and elsewhere in Rahner’s writings on espousing the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, though he may mention in passing the critical role that is still called for. Sesboüé, <i>Le Magistère à l’épreuve</i>, 289, preaches a twofold faithfulness: to Christ’s teaching <i>and</i> “to its credibility in our time”—does this entail that we should leave to the side what is unpalatable to our contemporaries, as it disagrees with their worldview? Matthew Cook, according to the French translation of the book he edited, <i>L’Eglise mondiale</i>, 139, seems to yield to Whorfian confusion and make worldview part of the linguistic system—fortunately, he qualifies: “to some extent.”</span></p>

He sees them as interlocking, but pens the following passage (174): “We <i>may stop</i> worrying about the author’s meaning. Is the reader a student with assignment? Or is he just an ordinary reader looking for entertainment or stimulating ideas?” The reader may take the text “as a springboard for his imagination.” I am reluctant to apply the suggestion to most parts of canonical Scripture. Does it fit the disciple’s posture listening to his Lord’s words?</span></p>
