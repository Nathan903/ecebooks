<p class="noind" id="pA6SM">Dogmatic theology is “the knowledge that God has revealed in his Word to the church concerning himself and all creatures as they stand in relation to him.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_1" id="ttf_08_1">1</a></sup> Dogmatic theology exists because the God who knows and loves himself in the bliss of his triune life wills to grant creatures a share in his triune bliss by making himself an object of creaturely knowledge and love through revelation. To put the matter in biblical idiom, dogmatics exists because of “the gospel of the glory of the blessed God” (1 Tim 1:11).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_2" id="ttf_08_2">2</a></sup> Accordingly, dogmatics is a subaltern science: the creature’s happiness in knowing and loving the triune God flows from and is generated by the triune God’s knowledge and love of himself and by his willingness to communicate himself to others. Holy Scripture is the divinely inspired instrument by which the triune God communicates to creatures a share in his knowledge and love. Holy Scripture therefore functions as the supreme source and norm of what is to be believed, what is to be done, and what is to be hoped for according to dogmatic theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_3" id="ttf_08_3">3</a></sup> Dogmatics, further<span id="z50-6">more, has an irreducibly “social element.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_4" id="ttf_08_4">4</a></sup> Dogmatic theology concerns the knowledge of God revealed in and authorized by God’s Word in Holy Scripture, and received and recognized by the church in its creeds and confessions, as well as its prayer and praise.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_5" id="ttf_08_5">5</a></sup> Dogmatics, in this regard, is “that movement of believing intelligence by which the church today attends to the instruction of the church past, submitting its received teaching to the rule of Holy Scripture in prayer that we may be of ‘the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus,’ and that we may ‘with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ’ (Rom. 15:4–6).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_6" id="ttf_08_6">6</a></sup> The subject of theology is the regenerate creaturely intelligence that receives, studies, contemplates, follows, and commends that which God has revealed in Holy Scripture and which has been confessed by the church. The ends of dogmatic theology are the glory of the blessed Trinity and the happiness of the people whose God is the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="center" id="At_6"/>
<p id="pz50-7">Dogmatic theology, thus understood, has a concern for being “systematic.” There is a concern for <i>unity</i>: for coordinating the teaching found across the various authors, redemptive historical epochs, literary genres, and testaments of the Bible, and for coordinating that teaching with whatever wisdom may be found outside of the Bible. Indeed, some of the most important judgments within a system of dogmatics concern how to relate the wisdom of Holy Scripture with what is known, or what is purported to be known, outside of Holy Scripture. There is also a concern for <i>scope</i>: considering the fullness of divine revelation in Holy Scripture, “the whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:27). “The whole of Scripture must prove the whole system,” Bavinck declares. And failure to take into account the fullness of biblical teaching “leads to one-sidedness and error in theology and pathology in the religious life.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_7" id="ttf_08_7">7</a></sup> Dogmatics, furthermore, has a concern for <i>proportion</i>: “Theology is a comprehensive science, a science of everything. But it is not a science of everything about everything.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_8" id="ttf_08_8">8</a></sup> The Bible has matters of “first importance”—“gospel issues” (1 Cor 15:3), and the Bible has matters of secondary importance (Matt 23:23). Dogmatics cannot afford to neglect matters of either primary or secondary importance. But it must attempt to reflect scriptural priorities within its own conceptual <span id="z51-6">representation of biblical teaching. Finally, there is a concern in dogmatics for <i>relations</i> between various elements of Christian teaching. According to Sarah Coakley, dogmatics embraces “the necessary challenge of presenting the gospel afresh in all its ramifications—systematically unfolding the connections of the parts of the vision that is set before us.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_9" id="ttf_08_9">9</a></sup> In giving attention to the unity, scope, proportions, and relations of Christian teaching about God and all things relative to God, dogmatic theology as systematic theology gives attention to the <i>beauty</i> of Christian teaching, the doxological character of Christian doctrine.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_10" id="ttf_08_10">10</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz51-7">Systematic theology in the sense described above has been a central feature of Christian teaching throughout much of the church’s history. Not only in what Karl Barth calls the “regular dogmatics” of Christian schools, universities, and seminaries, but also in the “irregular dogmatics” of pastoral catechesis and polemics, the church has inherited an embarrassment of riches in the form of books and articles, disputations and treatises that excel in expounding biblical teaching in a systematic manner for the good of the church and the glory of God. At times, systematic theology has even played the role of ruler amid the kingdom of human learning.</p>
<p id="pz51-8">The history of systematic theology is not an uncontested one, however. A little over a century ago, B. B. Warfield found he could no longer take for granted systematic theology’s right to rule as “queen of the sciences,” and found it necessary to defend the discipline’s right to exist. Several decades later, Barth would lament the state of academic systematic theology. Speaking of the decline of dogmatic theology in the Ritschlian tradition, Barth concludes, “Nothing we are producing now can stand comparison with the achievements of mediaeval and post-Reformation dogmatics, nor with Idealistic dogmatics, nor with Thomistic, let alone with the dogmatics of the Reformation. Would that we had even reached the point where we again regarded regular dogmatics as at least an admonitory ideal worth striving after!”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_11" id="ttf_08_11">11</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz51-9">Though it has not arrived at its former glory, systematic theology has witnessed something of a revival over the past several decades.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_12" id="ttf_08_12">12</a></sup> Due in part to institutional centers such as the Research Institute for Systematic <span id="z52-6">Theology at King’s College, London in the 1990s, journals like the <i>International Journal of Systematic Theology</i>, and the efforts of leading theologians in the field both to publish and to supervise at a doctoral level high quality academic work, systematic theology today enjoys some degree of prominence as an academic discipline in the English-speaking world. The recent spate of stand-alone and multivolume systematic theologies, which are beginning to appear in print, bodes well for the future of the discipline.</span></p>
<p id="pz52-7">The contemporary ascendancy of systematic theology has not met a completely warm reception among evangelicals. Already in his aforementioned 1897 essay, Warfield observes that systematic theology’s “sister discipline” biblical theology is “sometimes found resisting her [systematic theology’s] high pretensions and declaring that [she] will no longer have her to rule over [her].” Warfield responds with an end-of-the-nineteenth-century equivalent of the “sick burn.” He states, “Systematic Theology may look on with an amused tolerance and a certain older-sister’s pleased recognition of powers just now perhaps a little too conscious of themselves, when the new discipline of Bible Theology . . . tosses her fine young head and announces of her more settled sister that her day is over.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_13" id="ttf_08_13">13</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz52-8">Warfield may have underestimated the little sister’s potential for disruption within the kingdom of theological disciplines. Her resistance to systematic theology’s right to rule among the theological disciplines has not waned among evangelicals since Warfield’s day. In fact, as she has further matured, evangelical biblical theology has found further reasons, if not to question systematic theology’s right to exist, to question her reliability as a pathway into Holy Scripture. Systematic theology’s attempt to “organize” the biblical material in a systematic manner, and its commitment to engaging the doctrinal questions and formulas of the church, one leading biblical theologian argues, tends “to impose a structure not transparently given in Scripture itself” and risks allowing doctrinal debates, rather than the “categories” and “priorities” of the biblical text, to shape the discipline. Because its “ordering principles” are “topical, logical, and hierarchical, and as synchronic as possible,” systematic theology “does not encourage the exploration of the Bible’s plot-line, except incidentally.” “Thus systematic theology tends to be a little further removed from the biblical text than does biblical theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_14" id="ttf_08_14">14</a></sup> And this is precisely where little sister has something to <span id="z53-6">offer. “Biblical theology tends to seek out the rationality and communicative genius of each literary genre.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_15" id="ttf_08_15">15</a></sup> Furthermore, biblical theology prevents a “de-historicizing of the gospel by anchoring the person and work of Christ into the continuum of redemptive history.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_16" id="ttf_08_16">16</a></sup> Given its focus on the literary genius of the Bible, and upon the unfolding drama of redemptive history, biblical theology is thus well-equipped to “rescue” her big sister from the bane of theological “abstraction.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_17" id="ttf_08_17">17</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz53-7">More recently, biblical theology’s younger cousin, “missional theology,” has arrived on the scene at the royal court of theological disciplines. Having been raised by the same historicist nannies, and having sat at the feet of some of the same antispeculative tutors, she too wonders whether her ailing older relative might need a little help in reading and applying the teaching of Holy Scripture. Specifically, missional theology would direct systematic theology to attend more directly to the missional dimension of biblical theology and to order its theological reflection to the church’s missional end.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_18" id="ttf_08_18">18</a></sup> Refusal to accept such help, one leading missional theologian suggests, threatens to relegate dogmatics to a state of “sacred egocentricity,” to borrow a phrase from Barth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_19" id="ttf_08_19">19</a></sup> A sanctified systematic theology is one that is on the move with the mission of God.</p>
<p id="pz53-8">This game of thrones is admittedly nonviolent. And it is not clear that biblical theology, or missional theology for that matter, has pretensions of assuming systematic theology’s now vacant ruling position among the theological disciplines. Still, I hear in the younger relatives’ evaluation of their elder the tune from <i>Annie Get Your Gun</i>: “Anything you can do, / I can do better.”</p>
<p id="pz53-9">My purpose in what follows is not to defend the right of systematic theology to exist, much less its right to rule the broader theological or university curricula. My aim is more modest in nature: to commend a particular conception of dogmatic theology as theoretical, contemplative wisdom, a conception that is often missing in the historical, literary, and practical emphases of other theological disciplines but that, more than anything else, accounts for dogmatic theology’s “systematic” character. Along the way, I will <span id="z54-6">address some of the most formidable objections that have been raised against such a conception of dogmatics in classical and contemporary theology. My argument will unfold in a series of four theses.</span></p>
<p id="pz54-7"><b>THESIS 1:</b> God presents himself to us in his Word under the mode of a vision of glory. Theological wisdom is therefore supremely, but not exclusively, a wonder to behold, a truth to be known, and a doctrine to be believed.</p>
<p id="pz54-8">Divine appearance and creaturely vision are characteristic modes of God’s self-presentation to human beings in his Word. When God reveals himself to Moses in order to commission him as prophet and instrument of Israel’s exodus from Egypt, he “<i>appears</i>” to him “in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush” (Exod 3:2). And this wonder, the wonder of a bush that burns but is not consumed, causes Moses to “turn aside to <i>see</i> this great sight” (Exod 3:3).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_20" id="ttf_08_20">20</a></sup> In the context of this divine revelation and appearance, and in the context of Moses’s gaze, God proclaims his name to Moses: “I am who I am” (Exod 3:14), YHWH, the self-existent one, the God of Israel, its maker, redeemer, and reward. When God later consoles his miserable people through the prophet Isaiah, once again we witness the coordination of divine appearance and creaturely vision. “The <i>glory</i> of YHWH shall be revealed,” the prophet declares, “and all flesh shall <i>see</i> it together,” for thus “the mouth of YHWH has spoken” (Isa 40:5). And God’s commission that his herald proclaim “good news” of the new exodus includes the command to summon the people, “<i>Behold</i> your God! <i>Behold</i>, YHWH comes” (Isa 40:9–10).</p>
<p id="pz54-9">The New Testament proclaims the realization of this Mosaic pattern and the fulfillment of this Isaianic prophecy in the coming of Jesus to save his people from their sins and to establish the dwelling place of the triune God among them. And this coming too is a revelation of divine glory and an endowment of creaturely vision. John the Baptist prepares the prophesied way of <i>the Lord</i> in his preaching (Mark 1:2–8), and <i>Jesus appears</i> as the beloved Son of the Father, as one baptized in the Holy Spirit that he might baptize others as well (Mark 1:9–11). In the light of John the Baptist’s preaching and of Jesus’s appearing, the Beloved Disciple confesses: “we have <i>seen</i> his <i>glory</i>, the glory as of the only begotten Son from the Father, full of grace <span id="z55-6">and truth” (John 1:14).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_21" id="ttf_08_21">21</a></sup> This vision of divine glory, Peter tells us, at once confirms the prophetic expectation, grounds the apostolic witness, illumines our path in the time between Jesus’s first and second advents, and beckons us toward the day when “the morning star” will rise in our hearts (2 Pet 1:16–19). In the brightness of that day, we will behold God’s glory and see God’s face in the unmediated splendor of blessed Trinity (Rev 22:1–5). This, according to the unified testimony of the prophets and apostles, is our “blessed hope” (Titus 2:13).</span></p>
<p id="pz55-7">This is eternal life: to <i>know</i> the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent (John 17:3). For this reason, Peter Martyr Vermigli claims that “in the holy Scriptures contemplative [knowledge] hath the first place.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_22" id="ttf_08_22">22</a></sup> The Italian Reformer and father of Reformed Thomism adduces a host of biblical witnesses to the primacy of contemplative or theoretical wisdom in theology. Vermigli’s first example comes in biblical teaching about justification: “We must first believe, and be justified by faith,” he asserts; “afterward follow good works.” He also appeals to the pedagogical pattern exhibited in Paul’s Epistles: “First he handleth doctrine, afterward he descendeth to the instruction of manners, and to the order of life.” Vermigli finds further warrant for his claim in the Old Testament example of Israel: “The children of Israel were first gathered together under the faith of one God the savior. Afterward in the desert they received laws which served unto actual knowledge. And in the table of the ten commandments the same order is observed. For first he sayeth, I am the Lord thy God: which belongeth to faith or speculative knowledge. Afterward follow the precepts, which belong to the works required by God.”</p>
<p id="pz55-8">Vermigli’s claim that theoretical or contemplative wisdom “hath the first place” is not meant to deny the presence of practical wisdom in Holy Scripture: “In the holy Scriptures we have a knowledge of God contemplative, and that which consisteth in action.” However, Vermigli insists that contemplative wisdom enjoys both first and final place in relation to practical wisdom. In “the order of sanctification,” he argues, both faith and the renewal of the mind precede “just and honest deeds.” Moreover, “the end of Christian godliness,” he contends, is also contemplative in nature: “The end of Christian godliness is, that in us should be repaired <span id="z56-6">that image, whereunto we were made in righteousness and holiness of the truth, that we may every day grow up into the knowledge of God, until we be brought to see him with open face as he is.” For these reasons, Vermigli concludes “that speculative knowledge is preferred above the active. For doing is ordained for contemplation, not contrariwise.”</span></p>
<p id="pz56-7"><b>THESIS 2:</b> From this mode of God’s self-presentation in his Word arises the (partly) theoretical or contemplative nature of dogmatic theology. Vermigli offers an early and influential Reformed defense of theology’s status as a “mixed” species of wisdom, partly theoretical, partly practical, both <i>sophia</i> and <i>phronesis</i>. His view finds its root in Thomas Aquinas, who offers similar arguments in part 1, question 1 of the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, and bears fruit later in the Reformed tradition in Franciscus Junius’s <i>A Treatise on True Theology</i> and in Johannes Polyander’s opening disputation in the <i>Synopsis of a Purer Theology</i>, “Concerning the Most Sacred Theology.”</p>
<p id="pz56-8">This view regarding the “mixed” character of dogmatic theology is not uncontested, even within the Reformed tradition.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_23" id="ttf_08_23">23</a></sup> Bartholomäus Keckermann, the first Reformed theologian to give the title of “systematic theology” to a book on Christian doctrine, argues that theology is a purely practical discipline, “the religious prudence to gain salvation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_24" id="ttf_08_24">24</a></sup> The suggestion that theology is a “mixed” discipline, concerned with both theory and practice, Keckermann avers, “militates against the unity of the discipline of theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_25" id="ttf_08_25">25</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz56-9">A response to this objection already lies ready to hand in Thomas’s treatment of the issue. The unity of the discipline of theology does not follow from its possession of <i>either</i> a purely theoretical object <i>or</i> a purely practical object. The unity of the discipline, Thomas insists, “is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material aspect, but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object.” “Therefore, because Sacred Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being divinely revealed, whatever has been divinely revealed”—whether it is a matter of theoretical or practical wisdom—“possesses the one precise formality of the object of this science; and therefore is included under sacred doctrine as under one science.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_26" id="ttf_08_26">26</a></sup> In other words, because Holy Scripture speaks of doctrines and morals, of what <span id="z57-6">is to be believed, of what is to be done, and of what is to be hoped for, and because Holy Scripture provides the precise formality that unifies theology as a discipline, the “mixed” nature of theology’s object does not compromise the unity of the discipline. In Holy Scripture, <i>sophia</i> and <i>phronesis</i> are “like two streams flowing from one fountain.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_27" id="ttf_08_27">27</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz57-7">Objections to the theoretical or contemplative character of theology arise not only from formal concerns about the unity of the discipline. Objections also arise from fears that such a conception of theology renders it <i>irrelevant</i> to the concerns of practical Christianity or, worse, <i>idolatrous</i>.</p>
<p id="pz57-8">In the preface to his classic book, <i>Knowing God</i>, J. I. Packer contrasts “two kinds of interest in Christian things” by drawing upon John Mackay’s illustration of “persons sitting on the high front balcony of a Spanish house watching travelers go by on the road below.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_28" id="ttf_08_28">28</a></sup> “Balconeers,” Packer explains, “can overhear the travelers’ talk and chat with them; they may comment critically on the way that the travelers walk; or they may discuss questions about the road, how it can exist at all or lead anywhere, what might be seen from different points along it, and so forth; but they are onlookers, and their problems are theoretical only.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_29" id="ttf_08_29">29</a></sup> By contrast, “travelers . . . face problems which, though they have their theoretical angle, are essentially practical—problems of the ‘which-way-to-go’ and ‘how-to-make-it’ type, problems which call not merely for comprehension but for decision and action too.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_30" id="ttf_08_30">30</a></sup> “Balconeers and travelers may think over the same area,” Packer observes, “yet their problems differ.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_31" id="ttf_08_31">31</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz57-9">Note well: Packer does not wholly exclude a theoretical dimension from theology. The theology of travelers has its “theoretical angle.” But it is a theoretical angle that is oriented to practical concerns about how we should walk, where we should be going, and how we might get there from here. Moreover, Packer seems to suggest that any theoretical concern that is not wholly translatable into practical know-how is somehow suspect. Unprocessed theory is arcane and disinterested, laced with the vice of curiosity and lacking in self-commitment.</p>
<p id="pz57-10">The sinister side of theoretical wisdom should not be denied or ignored. We might label theoretical wisdom in its vicious mode “speculation,” that <span id="z58-6">mode and product of reflection that goes beyond the bounds of what God has revealed in his Word.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_32" id="ttf_08_32">32</a></sup> Nevertheless, the existence of a vicious mode of contemplation is not remedied by forsaking the balcony of theory for the highway of practice. We should be “anti-speculative” in our theology. We cannot afford to be “anti-theoretical” or “anti-contemplative.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_33" id="ttf_08_33">33</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz58-7">While the objects of theoretical wisdom do indeed provide principles of conduct, informing prudence as it seeks to weigh the wisest course of action in a given situation, the objects of theoretical reason cannot be exhausted by their translation into principles of conduct. When the glory of the Lord descends upon the tabernacle, and later upon the temple, Moses is unable to enter the tent of meeting (Exod 40:34–35), and the priests are unable to minister in the temple because the glory of God overfills its creaturely dwelling place (1 Kgs 8:11). In similar fashion, Paul prays that God the Father, by his Spirit, might enthrone Christ in the hearts of his ecclesiastical temple (Eph 2:19–22) to the end that the knowledge of Christ’s love would overfill the church “with all the fullness of God” (Eph 3:14–19). The revelation of God’s glory in the face of Jesus Christ grants to contemplative wisdom a surplus, an excess that exceeds not only the possibilities of Christian comprehension, but also the requirements of Christian conduct. In the presence of the glory of the Lord as he presents himself to us in his Word there is wonder: a wonder that begets inquiry, that informs and outstrips our actions, and that finally resolves into greater wonder.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_34" id="ttf_08_34">34</a></sup> “Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable” (Ps 145:3).</p>
<p id="pz58-8">Theology’s attention to this “surplus” dimension of theological wisdom is neither malign nor misanthropic; rather, it is fundamental to human flourishing in the courts of the Lord.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz59-7">To J. I. Packer’s fear of malign and misanthropic “theory,” I would present Josef Pieper’s <i>Happiness and Contemplation</i>.</p>
<p id="pz59-8">The worry that characterizing theology in part as a species of contemplative wisdom might foster irrelevance is closely related to the worry that such a characterization might foster idolatry. Oswald Bayer ably articulates this worry in his study, <i>Theology the Lutheran Way</i>. Therein, Bayer takes no prisoners, assailing theoretical, existential, and moral conceptions of theology and in their place offering a conception of theology as essentially linguistic (and to this Vanhoozer protégé, quite compelling): a doctrine of the varied forms of the Word of God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_35" id="ttf_08_35">35</a></sup> According to Bayer’s conception, the object of theology is neither theoretical, as Hegel suggests, nor existential, as Schleiermacher suggests, nor moral, as Kant and his epigones suggest. The object of theology, as Luther defines it in his commentary on Psalm 51, is “the sinful human and the God who justifies.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_36" id="ttf_08_36">36</a></sup> God’s encounter with the human being in his Word of law and gospel constitutes the unity of theology as a discipline.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_37" id="ttf_08_37">37</a></sup> Theology accordingly “suffers” the Word in its varied work, whether it be in the church as worship or in the academy as science, and in so doing theology is renewed in its thinking, feeling, and acting before God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_38" id="ttf_08_38">38</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz59-9">Under the critical eye of Bayer, the problems with a theoretical or contemplative conception of theology are legion. Two stand out. First, such a conception attempts to mediate and reconcile all things under the umbrella of a single, totalizing theory of “the One, the True, the Good, and the Beautiful.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_39" id="ttf_08_39">39</a></sup> Second, such a conception threatens to abstract the theologian from his or her specific context as a creature of history.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_40" id="ttf_08_40">40</a></sup> In both cases, “it bypasses the cross of Jesus Christ,” which shatters sinful humanity’s totalizing illusions and situates him in God’s presence, not as a generic human being but as a justified sinner.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_41" id="ttf_08_41">41</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz60-6">How should we respond to these concerns? With Bayer, we may grant that a theoretical conception of theology as enunciated in German idealism and epitomized in Hegel is susceptible to these criticisms, along with a host of others. (I am reminded of Robert Jenson’s famous comment that Hegel’s only error was to confuse himself with the final judge of history!) However, the many errors of Hegel in particular and of German idealism in general are not addressed by <i>forsaking</i> the theoretical nature of theology but rather by <i>moderating</i> it. Bayer himself shows the path toward moderation in following the traditional Protestant orthodox example of locating “our theology” within its pilgrim context: <i>under</i> God, <i>short</i> of the beatific vision. Locating the creaturely contemplation of God and of all things relative to God within a pilgrim context allows us to admit, indeed insist upon, the limited nature of our contemplation as wayfarers (<i>viatores</i>) traveling east of Eden and short of the eternal kingdom. It also alerts us to the unavoidably contested nature of theology in the here and now and acknowledges the importance of lament in the space opened by the mismatch between God’s promises and present circumstances. Finally, locating creaturely contemplation within a pilgrim context directs us to expect perfect contemplation only in the beatific vision of the triune God.</p>
<p id="pz60-7">Here I would note my own worry about Bayer’s “Lutheran” proposal. Bayer’s conception of the object of theology as “the sinful human and the God who justifies” (unwittingly) threatens to narrow the range of God’s self-presentation in his Word.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_42" id="ttf_08_42">42</a></sup> God does indeed present himself in Holy Scripture as justifier of the ungodly (Rom 4:5)—to the praise of his matchless grace. But this does not exhaust the nature of God’s self-presentation in his Word. Nor can God’s identity as justifier of the ungodly finally be appreciated apart from a broader conception of God’s triune identity and of God’s triune works in nature, grace and glory.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_43" id="ttf_08_43">43</a></sup> God presents himself in Holy Scripture as thrice-holy wonder; as creator and providential ruler; as redeemer, justifier, and sanctifier of sinners; and as perfecting reward of the saints, along with the rest of the created world. And these varied forms of God’s self-presentation in his Word must also find their place in <span id="z61-6">our conception of the object of theology. “Great are the works of the Lord, studied by all who delight in them” (Ps 111:2).</span></p>
<p id="pz61-7">This leads us to the primary reason for acknowledging the theoretical dimension of dogmatic theology. Dogmatics derives its character as theoretical, contemplative wisdom from its primary object: the triune God. The triune God who presents himself to us in his Word as an object of intelligent adoration presents himself to us under the name of YHWH, the self-existent, independent one. God’s identity as the triune YHWH determines every feature of his being and activity <i>ad intra</i> and <i>ad extra</i>. God is “independent, not only in his existence but consequently also in all his attributes and perfections, in all his decrees and deeds. He is independent in his intellect (Rom. 11:34–35), in his will (Dan. 4:35; Rom. 9:19; Eph. 1:5; Rev. 4:11), in his counsel (Ps. 33:11; Isa. 46:10), in his love (Hos. 14:4), in his power (Ps. 115:3), and so forth.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_44" id="ttf_08_44">44</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz61-8">God in his being—and, through the revelation of his name, God in our reflection—exists in and of himself in the bliss of his triune life. God does not exist for any reason that lies outside of himself. Quite the contrary, “we exist for him” (1 Cor 8:6). Indeed “from him and through him and to him are all things” (Rom 11:36). Thus, while the study of God promotes innumerable practical ends and is of utmost relevance, comprising the supreme happiness of rational creatures, the study of God is not exhausted in its service of practical ends. God is not, as Ritschl suggests, “a ‘Hülfsvorstellung’—a useful postulate for the validating of our practical ends.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_45" id="ttf_08_45">45</a></sup> The gospel reveals a truth that accords with godliness (Titus 1:1). And the godliness that gospel truth informs, in turn, prepares us for further contemplation of God and for the full realization of human happiness in the vision of God (1 Tim 4:7–10; Titus 2:11–14; Heb 12:14). “God is wisdom’s goal, and that glimpse of God himself is saving and filled with glory, toward which we strive with this wisdom as our guide.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_46" id="ttf_08_46">46</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz61-9"><b>THESIS 3:</b> As theoretical or contemplative wisdom, theology is not a view from nowhere. Dogmatic theology is a view of God from God in the presence of God.</p>
<p id="pz61-10">As a species of theoretical or contemplative wisdom, engaged by pilgrims as they are led by the Word out of the misery of sin into the bliss of God’s <span id="z62-6">eternal kingdom, dogmatic theology occupies itself with God. Dogmatic theology is a view <i>of God</i>.</span></p>
<p id="pz62-7">Because God is not only the self-existent one but also the author and end of all things, theology’s object is twofold. It fathoms the unsearchable depths of God’s infinite and independent being, wisdom, goodness, and power: “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?” (Rom 11:33–35). Theology also fathoms the unsearchable depths of God’s works: “all things,” which are “of him and through him and to him” (Rom 11:36). Theology’s twofold object is the thrice-holy “Lord God Almighty” (Rev 4:8) and all things relative to God as “Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end” (Rev 22:13).</p>
<p id="pz62-8">Given its universal scope, theology contemplates objects also contemplated by other disciplines: philosophers contemplate God, anthropologists contemplate human beings, botanists contemplate the lilies of the field. What distinguishes dogmatic theology as a discipline is not the uniqueness of its objects, though theology certainly knows things about God, humanity, and even the lilies of the field that other disciplines fail to know. What distinguishes dogmatic theology as a discipline is the perspective from which it knows God, humanity, and the lilies of the field. Dogmatics knows these things from the perspective of divine revelation in Holy Scripture: from the perspective of God’s self-naming as the triune YHWH (Matt 28:19), from the perspective of God’s naming human beings “Adam” (Gen 5:2), from the perspective of God’s teaching regarding the lilies of the field as objects of his fatherly care and providence (Matt 6:28–29).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_47" id="ttf_08_47">47</a></sup> Dogmatic theology is a view of God <i>from God</i>.</p>
<p id="pz62-9">Theology’s knowledge of God and all things relative to God is not derived, first and foremost, by ascending from creatures to their author and end (cf. Rom 1:19–20). Theology’s knowledge of God is hidden from the wise of this world (Matt 11:25). The world by its wisdom does not know God (1 Cor 1:21). Theology knows God and all things relative to God because God stoops down to us and unfolds, from the inside out, the mystery of his triune life and of his triune purpose for all things: “All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and <span id="z63-6">anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him” (Matt 11:27). “No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God” (1 Cor 2:11–12).</span></p>
<p id="pz63-7">This is why dogmatics, on the present understanding at least,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_48" id="ttf_08_48">48</a></sup> does not follow the method, common to so many sciences, of reasoning from the totality of created effects back to their principles and causes, both created and uncreated. The method of dogmatic theology is to begin with God, the self-subsistent Trinity, and to trace the works of God “from him and through him and to him” as their principle and end, and that because that is how God has revealed himself and all things in relation to himself in his Word (Gen 1:1; Prov 8; John 1:1–18; Rom 11:33–36; 1 Cor 8:6; Col 1:15–20; Heb 1:1–4). Thus, according to Thomas Aquinas, sacred doctrine is “wisdom above all human wisdom,” in part because it “treats of God viewed as the highest cause—not only so far as he can be known through creatures just as philosophers knew him . . . but also so far as he is known to himself alone and revealed to others.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_49" id="ttf_08_49">49</a></sup> Dogmatic theology’s method is “analysis by principles” rather than “analysis by elements.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_50" id="ttf_08_50">50</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz63-8">Dogmatic theology’s view of God “from God” (i.e., from the perspective of divine revelation) contributes to its “scientific” character. Drawing upon an Aristotelian conception of wisdom, Jason Baehr defines <i>sophia</i> as the “deep explanatory understanding of epistemologically significant subject matters.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_51" id="ttf_08_51">51</a></sup> What constitutes wisdom as scientific, on such a conception, is not simply its cognition of this or that feature of reality but also its ability to indicate the <i>reasons or causes</i> for this or that feature of reality and to grasp the <i>relationships</i> between this or that feature of reality.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_52" id="ttf_08_52">52</a></sup> Materially stated, theology, as a species of contemplative wisdom, is “scientific” because it considers all things <i>in terms of their relationships to one another and, ultimately, in terms of their relationship to God, their efficient, exemplary, and final cause</i>. Formally stated, theology is scientific because it considers all things <i>in view of their meaning and purpose as interpreted by the divine counsel insofar as the divine</i> <span id="z64-6"><i>counsel has been unveiled to us in Holy Scripture</i>. Theology has been granted “deep”—though by no means exhaustive—“explanatory understanding” of God and all things relative to God because God has made “known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth” (Eph 1:9–10). We have been granted a share in “the depths of God” (1 Cor 2:10) because we have been granted a share in “the mind of Christ” (1 Cor 2:16).</span></p>
<p id="pz64-7">Does a scientific conception of dogmatics threaten to turn dogmatics into a Spinozan <i>more geometrico demonstrata</i>, where every item within the system follows from its first principles by means of a “rigid logic”?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_53" id="ttf_08_53">53</a></sup> No. As Polyander explains, theology is scientific because “it is the knowledge of things that are necessary, either without relation to any other being, as for example of God and his attributes, or of things that are necessary on the presupposition of God’s will, such as knowledge of his worship and works.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_54" id="ttf_08_54">54</a></sup> In other words, in knowing the triune God, theology knows an object that exists by “absolute necessity.” God exists <i>by nature</i> (Exod 3:14; John 5:26). In knowing the works of God, however, theology knows objects that exist by virtue of a “hypothetical necessity.” The works of God exist <i>only as a consequence of God’s free and generous will</i>, which “loves” creation into existence: “in order that it should be, and in order that it should abide.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_55" id="ttf_08_55">55</a></sup> In studying God, theology considers the eternally perfect, complete, and necessary act of being, knowledge, and love that is God’s blessed triune life. In studying the manifold works of God, however, theology does not attempt to deduce the works of God from God or from one another. Instead, it attends to the “dramatic” necessity that accompanies the contingencies of creatures and creaturely events under the wise and loving providence of the blessed Trinity, their author and end.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_56" id="ttf_08_56">56</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz64-8">To the preceding points we may add another. As dogmatic theology is a view of God from God, it is also a view of God <i>in the presence of God</i>. The point is worth emphasizing, given our stress upon the scientific character of dogmatic theology: Dogmatics does not contemplate God and all things in <span id="z65-6">relation to God from a God’s eye point of view. When it comes to God’s own knowledge of himself and all things (i.e., archetypal theology), Junius says, “we should not seek to trace it out but rather to stand in awe.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_57" id="ttf_08_57">57</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz65-7"><i>Our</i> theology (i.e., ectypal theology), <i>our</i> dogmatics, contemplates its twofold object from a humbler vantage point: “<i>with</i> all the saints” (Eph 3:18), <i>as</i> a servant of the Lord, <i>as</i> a priest in God’s holy temple. In this regard, “To profess theology is to do holy work. It is a priestly ministration in the house of the Lord. It is itself a service of worship, a consecration of mind and heart to the honour of His name.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_58" id="ttf_08_58">58</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz65-8"><b>THESIS 4:</b> As a view of God from God in the presence of God, dogmatic theology takes a “systematic” shape in commending the fruits of its contemplation.</p>
<p id="pz65-9">Given its pilgrim state <i>under</i> God and <i>short</i> of the beatific vision, dogmatic theology must beware the dangers of what the late John Webster calls “excessive systematic pretension.” Nevertheless, as that Reformed Thomist would also remind us, the limitations “placed upon systematic intelligence” in our pilgrim state are but <i>restrictions</i>, not <i>prohibitions</i>. Webster continues: “Little theological profit is yielded by the reduction of systematic thought to false consciousness. Theological self-deprecation along these lines appears modest, but the underlying assumption—that there are no systematic intellectual virtues, only intellectual vices—betrays lazy trust in indeterminacy to deliver the mind from folly.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_59" id="ttf_08_59">59</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz65-10">What shape, then, might a modest system of dogmatic theology take? We can only lament, with the loss of John himself, the loss of John’s contribution to the genre of systematic theology. However, taking as its starting point Paul’s declaration of astonished, contemplative wonder in Romans 11:33–36, and instructed by John’s sketches and intimations on the subject here and there, a system of theology might fittingly be constructed in the following manner.</p>
<p id="pz65-11">Following a brief introduction to the nature, object, principles, practitioners, and ends of dogmatic theology,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_60" id="ttf_08_60">60</a></sup> a system of theology might treat, first, “the depth of the riches” of the triune God in his unfathomable being (Rom 11:33). Treating God “in himself” before treating God in his relationship to us is not a particularly welcome move in contemporary <span id="z66-6">theology. In the first volume of his systematic theology, <i>Theology for Liberal Protestants</i>, Douglas Ottati treats the doctrine of God as the third major topic, having treated, first, the cosmos, and, second, the human being. His intention is to avoid speaking “of God or the divine nature as it is or may be ‘in itself ’ ” and to speak only of God “in relationship with the world as creation and ourselves as creatures.” The first proposition he introduces on the doctrine of God states that “theological language is peculiar because God is not an object alongside other objects—and is not knowable as other objects are knowable.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_61" id="ttf_08_61">61</a></sup> Such a proposition is, of course, both true and admirable. However, given Ottati’s commitment to treating God exclusively in relation to creatures, he struggles to deliver on the promise of his leading proposition when it comes to theological exposition. “God is not an object alongside other objects that we can measure, distinguish, and define with precision,” Ottati states. “Instead, the divine is a reality that we sense <i>in and through</i> our interrelationships and encounters with other things.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_62" id="ttf_08_62">62</a></sup> While it is certainly true that, for pilgrim theology at least, our access to God always comes through creaturely media and our sensation thereof, this explanation hardly constitutes an adequate statement of divine transcendence of creaturely categories. Something at once more substantial and more concrete by way of dogmatic description is required.</span></p>
<p id="pz66-7">Treating God “in himself” before treating God in relation to creatures is essential to the extent that theology’s contemplation of God aims to be contemplation of his revealed name YHWH. The infinite fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in their eternal relations of communication, knowledge, and love is not a fullness that God receives from anyone or anything else: “who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?” (Rom 11:35). The answer is: no one. He is who he is (Exod 3:14; Rev 1:8). “Blessed be his glorious name” (Ps 72:19).</p>
<p id="pz66-8">Moreover, treating God “in himself” before treating God in relation to creatures allows theology to properly characterize God’s relation to creatures as a “mixed relation,” real on the side of the creature but not on the side of God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_63" id="ttf_08_63">63</a></sup> Far from portraying God as aloof and disengaged from his creatures, such a relation characterizes God’s relationship to his creatures as one of absolute benevolence, where God is “absolute giver” <span id="z67-6">and the creature is “absolute receiver.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_64" id="ttf_08_64">64</a></sup> God, the blessed Trinity, does not relate to creatures in order to add anything to his perfect life but in order to manifest the fullness of his glory and goodness to and upon the creature and in so doing to bring the creature into its appointed perfection. “Talk of the eternal fullness of God’s triune life—theological interest in the hypostatic relations of Father, Son and Spirit that constitute and suffice for the divine life, without addition—secures the divine manifestation without acquisition, and with it the marvellously disinterested interest that God takes in us.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_65" id="ttf_08_65">65</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz67-7">Again following the lead of Paul’s doxology in Romans 11, a system of theology might treat, second, the works of God, “all things” that are “from” and “through” and “to” the blessed Trinity (Rom 11.36). The gospel identifies God not only as “the blessed God” (1 Tim 1:11) but also as “the King of the ages” (1 Tim 1:17). Accordingly, a system of theology must trace “the economy of God” (ἢ οἰκονομίαν θεου, 1 Tim 1:4) as it unfolds in the works of nature, grace, and glory. Each of these three works of God is <i>distinct</i> from the others,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_66" id="ttf_08_66">66</a></sup> their interrelationship not being one of an unfolding world process but of God’s “plan for the fullness of time” (Eph 1:10). Nevertheless, each of God’s three works is <i>related</i> to the others within God’s counsel and purpose: in God’s good pleasure, God’s good work of creation, ruined by sin, is restored and perfected through God’s works of grace and glory. <i>Gratia non tollit naturum, sed perficit</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_67" id="ttf_08_67">67</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz67-8">Third, with respect to each individual topic within a potential system of theology, there is the need to connect each topic not only to other topics, relating, for example, sin to grace and justification to good works. There is also the need to connect each individual topic, by means of causal analysis, to God as its efficient, exemplary, impulsive, and final cause. This is not due to an occasionalist impulse that would deny the integrity of God’s various creatures in their diverse natures, activities, and ends. It is due to the fact that, strictly speaking, the natures, activities, and ends of God’s various creatures only exist in relation to God, their supreme author and end, and therefore that each of God’s various creatures can only be understood <i>with theological intelligence</i> in relation to God their supreme author and end. It is one thing, for example, to trace biblical teaching about the church as temple <span id="z68-6">along a redemptive-historical trajectory and quite another to relate the church as temple to its triune maker (Eph 2:19–22) and goal (Eph 3:20–21). Only in the latter case do we obtain a truly <i>theological</i> understanding of the church as the temple of God.</span></p>
<p id="pz68-7">In following this method or “way through” its various topics, a system of dogmatic theology proves itself true to its name as “theology.” Dogmatics, expounded as such, “describes for us God, always God, from beginning to end—God in his being, God in his creation, God against sin, God in Christ, God breaking down all resistance through the Holy Spirit and guiding the whole of creation back to the objective he decreed for it: the glory of his name.” Such a system of theology also proves that, far from being “a dull and arid science,” dogmatics “is a theodicy, a doxology to all God’s virtues and perfections, a hymn of adoration and thanksgiving, a ‘glory to God in the highest’ (Luke 2:14).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_08_68" id="ttf_08_68">68</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="pz68-8">C<span class="smallcaps" id="Aqdq">ONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz68-9">In the preceding argument, I have attempted to commend a conception of dogmatic theology as a “mixed” discipline, partly theoretical, partly practical, focusing on the generative basis of such a conception in Holy Scripture, drawing out some of its major implications, and addressing some of the objections posed against it in classical and contemporary theology. I have also suggested how a contemplative understanding of dogmatics might inform a “system” of theology as an elaboration of the knowledge of God and all things relative to God. In drawing the argument to a conclusion, I want to return to the question of how such a conception might relate to the broader theological and academic curriculum.</p>
<p id="pz68-10">While the primarily historical, literary, and practical emphases of the disciplines of biblical theology and missional theology can eclipse, and in many cases have eclipsed, the theoretical and contemplative dimensions of Christian teaching, the same need not be said for the discipline of dogmatics, with its mix of theoretical and practical emphases. Dogmatic theology can function as an inclusive rather than an exclusive discipline in relation to other disciplines. Because of its attention to the supreme object of Christian knowledge and obedience, the triune God, and because of its concern to order all things in relation to him, dogmatics has the capacity for providing a framework that can both organize and preserve the integrity <span id="z69-1">of other disciplines devoted to the various hermeneutical, historical, and literary aspects of exegesis, and to the various moral, pastoral, liturgical, apologetic, and missional aspects of Christian ministry, not to mention other enterprises of human learning, for these disciplines too are finally ordered to the glory of the triune God and to our well-being in him. To the extent that the church and various institutions of higher learning are ready and able to acknowledge this, there may yet be an opportunity for dogmatic theology as systematic theology to take its place, once again, as queen of the sciences: for the good of the world and for the flourishing of human beings in beholding and reflecting the glory of our blessed and triune God. “To him be glory forever” (Rom 11.36).</span></p>
