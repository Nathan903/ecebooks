<p class="noind" id="pA6T0">N<span class="smallcaps" id="AstD">EARLY A DECADE AGO</span> J<span class="smallcaps" id="AYFq">OHN</span> W<span class="smallcaps" id="ATPs">EBSTER</span> drew attention to the rising influence of “theologies of retrieval,” describing them as too diverse to constitute an official movement or school.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_1" id="ttf_16_1">1</a></sup> If retrieval practices have only grown more diverse since that time, they are nonetheless so pervasive throughout contemporary theology that it is difficult not to conceptualize them as a kind of movement.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_2" id="ttf_16_2">2</a></sup> Like the turn toward theological interpretation in biblical theology, the turn toward retrieval in systematic and historical theology lacks official boundaries and resists precise definition. It is better understood as a set of shared loyalties or instincts in theological method—an overall attitude guided by the conviction that premodern resources are not an obstacle in the age of progress, but a well in the age of thirst.</p>
<p id="pAKWx">Of course, in one sense theological retrieval is nothing new. A posture of reception and transmission is a basic part of Christian identity, and the <span id="z211-6">church has always drawn from her past to meet the challenges of her present.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_3" id="ttf_16_3">3</a></sup> Nonetheless, retrieval has come to have a more specific and deliberate use in the late modern West, where the individualism and freedom from authority that characterizes the secularizing culture have compelled the church to look for new sources of inspiration and synthesis. It is this cultural context, perhaps, that explains why retrieval movements are springing up in so many different traditions—from the <i>ressourcement</i> theology or <i>la nouvelle théologie</i> of Henri De Lubac and other French Roman Catholic theologians to the Radical Orthodoxy of John Milbank (Anglican), the paleo-orthodoxy of Thomas Oden (Methodist), the ecumenical labors of Donald Bloesch (UCC) or Robert Jenson (mainline Lutheran), the ancient-future movement of Robert Webber (also Anglican), and so forth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_4" id="ttf_16_4">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz211-7">Alongside these various Catholic, Anglican, and mainline Protestant movements, retrieval is on the rise in evangelicalism. In 2015, two book-length treatments of theological retrieval came out from evangelical authors, published by evangelical presses and covered with blurbs from evangelical theologians.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_5" id="ttf_16_5">5</a></sup> At the same time, there remains considerable ambivalence in many Protestant circles, particularly evangelical Protestant circles in the United States, about the retrieval of patristic and medieval theology. This ambivalence often manifests itself, at both popular and technical levels, in sheer neglect: one wonders how many evangelical pastors or divinity students could say a single solitary thing about, say, the tenth century; or the seventh. Cardinal John Henry Newman complained in the nineteenth century that England’s “popular religion scarcely recognizes the fact of the twelve long ages which lie between the Councils of Nicaea and Trent.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_6" id="ttf_16_6">6</a></sup> If Newman’s conclusion that “to be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant” did not strictly follow, its overall sentiment is difficult to dismiss—particularly because underneath the antihistorical bent of popular <span id="z212-6">Protestantism lie deeper patterns of historical interpretation that have often marked even the most eloquent expressions of the Protestant faith. One thinks, for instance, of the recurring identification of the antichrist with the papacy, a view that finds its way into the <i>Westminster Confession of Faith</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_7" id="ttf_16_7">7</a></sup> Or in more recent times, Protestant interpretations of church history are often shaped by the old Enlightenment caricature of the medieval era as a “Dark Age” of superstition and ignorance,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_8" id="ttf_16_8">8</a></sup> and by the Anabaptist view of a “great apostasy” or “great fall” in the early church.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_9" id="ttf_16_9">9</a></sup> On the whole, Protestants today often regard the Christianity of Caedmon and Charlemagne as more different than similar to the Christianity of John Bunyan and Billy Graham.</span></p>
<p id="pz212-7">In what follows, I suggest that the affirmation of a robust Protestantism need not prohibit, but should rather encourage, an appropriation of the wisdom of the early and medieval church.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_10" id="ttf_16_10">10</a></sup> First, I probe different understandings of what it means to be Protestant by examining B. B. Warfield’s retrieval of Augustine, contrasting his approach with the retrieval practices of the Reformers. Second, I suggest four ways that patristic and medieval theology can resource contemporary Protestant theology, each with a metaphor and then an example or case study. Finally, I discuss three early particular medieval theologians/texts that may be especially helpful for modern Protestants to retrieve.</p>
<h2 id="pz213-6">R<span class="smallcaps" id="AC0I">ETRIEVING THE</span> L<span class="smallcaps" id="AOx8">EAVENED</span> B<span class="smallcaps" id="AuaY">READ OUT OF THE</span> U<span class="smallcaps" id="AdDh">NLEAVENED</span>: W<span class="smallcaps" id="AOGu">ARFIELD ON</span> A<span class="smallcaps" id="AjyA">UGUSTINE</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="AWfW">Some of the eccentricities of modern Protestant interpretation of patristic and medieval theology can be observed in B.B. Warfield’s appropriation of Augustine’s theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_11" id="ttf_16_11">11</a></sup> Warfield argued that the doctrine of <i>grace</i> is Augustine’s greatest legacy and the truest center of his thought. He located Augustine’s significance as being the first of the church fathers to give adequate expression to “evangelical religion”—that is, the religion of faith, as opposed to the religion of works.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_12" id="ttf_16_12">12</a></sup> For Warfield, “a new Christian piety dates from [Augustine],” as well as “a new theology corresponding to this new type of piety,” such that Augustine may be termed the author of grace as well as the father of evangelicalism.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_13" id="ttf_16_13">13</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz213-7">Warfield was not, however, blind to the aspects of Augustine’s theology that seem to stand at odds with this interpretation: his complex sacramentology, complete with doctrines of baptismal regeneration, a sacrificial understanding of Mass, and an <i>ex opere operato</i> understanding of sacramental efficacy; his hierarchical ecclesiology, complete an affirmation of the papacy, the magisterium of the church, and an understanding of the visible church as God’s kingdom on earth; and his doctrines of saintly intercession, purgatory, penance, merits, and the perpetual virginity of Mary. With these aspects of his theology in mind, Warfield called Augustine “the founder of Roman Catholicism” who “called into being a new type of Christianity” in which the church is the center of religious feeling.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_14" id="ttf_16_14">14</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz213-8">Ascribing to the same person the titles “father of evangelicalism” and “founder of Roman Catholicism” conjures up a sense of ambivalence that may usefully describe Warfield’s broader attitude toward the whole of medieval Christianity stemming from Augustine. Indeed, he suggested, “the problem which Augustine bequeathed to the Church for solution, the Church required a thousand years to solve.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_15" id="ttf_16_15">15</a></sup> Warfield describes these two sides of Augustine’s thought—his “evangelical” doctrine of grace and his Roman Catholic ecclesiology—as “two children . . . struggling in the womb of his mind.” But for Warfield, Augustine’s doctrine of grace <span id="z214-6">is the “child of his heart.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_16" id="ttf_16_16">16</a></sup> Thus in Warfield’s interpretation, the <i>real</i> Augustine is the desperate and prayerful Augustine of the <i>Confessions</i>, the anti-Pelagian Augustine who prays, “command what you will, and give what you command.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_17" id="ttf_16_17">17</a></sup> In his doctrine of the church, by contrast, we get the vestiges of Cyprian and Tertullian, taken on thoughtlessly by Augustine, that gradually diminish throughout his life. In Warfield’s metaphor, the leaven of Augustine’s doctrine of grace was working through the dough of his doctrine of the church, but “death intervened before all the elements of his thinking were completely leavened.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_18" id="ttf_16_18">18</a></sup> Had Augustine only lived longer, he would have handed down “a thoroughly worked out system of evangelical theology” rather than the contradictions that rended the church for a millennium.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_19" id="ttf_16_19">19</a></sup> These perceived tensions in Augustine became Warfield’s rubric for engaging the medieval church as a whole, as evident in his definition of the Reformation as “the triumph of Augustine’s doctrine of grace over Augustine’s doctrine of the Church.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_20" id="ttf_16_20">20</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz214-7">Warfield’s interpretation of Augustine poses challenges. One wonders, for instance, whether Augustine was quite so decidedly on his way toward becoming a proto-Protestant, had he only lived a little longer. But underneath these interpretational matters lies a more basic methodological issue regarding how we do retrieval as Protestants. In Warfield’s method of retrieval, Augustine’s theology get sifted through the grid of the Reformation, such that the good in Augustine’s theological legacy is distinguished from the bad by its sixteenth-century consequence. Warfield’s approach could give the impression that a modern Protestant’s primary theological community only includes the last five hundred years of Protestant history, and then from this community one makes a secondary, tentative step into the previous fifteen hundred years of church history. To construct a metaphor, Protestant theology is the castle in which we safely live; patristic and medieval theology is a dark forest surrounding the castle into which we may occasionally venture.</p>
<p id="pz214-8">Of course, there is nothing wrong with Warfield reading church history as a Protestant, with Protestant convictions intact under an overall commitment to <i>sola Scriptura</i>. But affirming Protestant distinctives is not the same as using them as a filter, and a principial <i>sola Scriptura</i> can easily slide <span id="z215-6">into a practical <i>sola reformatione</i>. Approaching the early church indirectly, through the intermediate link of Reformation theology, poses the danger of failing to appreciate patristic and medieval theology on its own terms and in its own context, and thus of hindering our ability to learn from it. After all, there are many doctrines that the Reformers held in continuity with the early and medieval church, but did not engage since they were not in dispute in the sixteenth century. There are many other doctrines that the Reformers affirmed with the early and medieval church, but did so with less eloquence or detail. And there are still other doctrines where the Reformers’ approach was different from that of earlier generations, and yet we may not be convinced that their efforts are the final word on the matter. In Warfield’s account, it never seems to come into view where Protestant theology might be profitably stretched or challenged by Augustine. A figure so sharply divided against himself (indeed, in Warfield’s account, an entire millennium so sharply divided against itself) needs to be disentangled more than heard.</span></p>
<p id="pz215-7">But there are good reasons for favoring a more inclusive approach in which all two thousand years of church history function as our most basic theological community, and Scripture alone stands above it as our authoritative norm. Indeed, the practice of the Reformers suggests that such an approach is not only more practically beneficial but actually more rigorously Protestant. As severe as the Reformers’ criticisms of medieval Roman Catholicism could be, they always distinguished themselves from the Anabaptists, making clear that their intention was to reform, not re-create, the true church of God. To this end they not only regularly retrieved the theology of the early church, but in fact cast their entire reform effort in terms of its retrieval.</p>
<p id="pz215-8">John Calvin, for instance, in his prefatory letter to King Francis in the <i>Institutes</i>, defended the Reformation cause against the charge of novelty by grounding the Protestant claim to antiquity in “the right of recovery” (<i>postliminii iure</i>)—a technical legal term referring to the recovery of lost property or privilege.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_21" id="ttf_16_21">21</a></sup> Rather than overthrowing tradition, Calvin compiled an extensive list of issues—ranging from eating meat during Lent to transubstantiation to ministerial celibacy—on which church fathers stood with the Reformers and against their Roman Catholic opponents.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_22" id="ttf_16_22">22</a></sup> <span id="z216-6">Elsewhere, in his dispute with Cardinal Sadolet, Calvin again aligned the Protestant cause with that of the early church, claiming against his Roman Catholic opponents: “our agreement with antiquity is far greater than yours, but all that we have attempted has been to renew the ancient form of the church . . . [that existed] in the age of Chrysostom, and Basil, among the Greeks, and of Cyprian, Ambrose, and Augustine, among the Latins.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_23" id="ttf_16_23">23</a></sup> With the other magisterial Reformers, Calvin affirmed the ecumenical creeds and councils, stating that words like <i>ousia</i> and <i>hypostasis</i> were necessary to confront heresy. In the section on the Trinity in his draft of the French Confession, he wrote, “we receive what was determined by the ancient councils, and we hate all sects and heresies which were rejected by the holy doctors from the time of St. Hilary and Athanasius until St. Ambrose and Cyril.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_24" id="ttf_16_24">24</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz216-7">Martin Luther also affirmed the Apostles’ Creed as well as the Chalcedonian and Nicene formulations, and defended the use of technical Trinitarian terminology employed by the church fathers (like <i>homoousios</i>) against Martin Bucer who protested that we must use strictly biblical language.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_25" id="ttf_16_25">25</a></sup> In his <i>On the Councils and the Church</i>, Luther argued that “the decrees of the genuine councils must remain in force permanently, just as they have always been in force.” Luther insisted that <i>sola Scriptura</i> entailed the subordination of tradition and creed under Scripture, but not, as it often misconstrued today, any diminution of their proper role.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_26" id="ttf_16_26">26</a></sup> Thus, Luther declared, “we do not reject everything that is under the dominion of the Pope. For in that event we should also reject the Christian church. Much Christian good is to be found in the Papacy and from there it descended to us.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_27" id="ttf_16_27">27</a></sup> Later Lutherans followed in this view, placing the Apostles’, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds at the front of the <i>Book of Concord</i> (as Anglicans would with the <i>Thirty-Nine Articles</i>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_28" id="ttf_16_28">28</a></sup> The <i>Augsburg Confession</i>, the primary <span id="z217-6">Lutheran confession and arguably the most important sixteenth-century Protestant confession, concludes by affirming the continuity of Lutheran doctrine with the true church: “nothing has been received among us, in doctrine or practice, that is contrary to scripture <i>or to the church catholic</i>.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_29" id="ttf_16_29">29</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz217-7">Even from this brief survey, it is clear that there are some significant differences between the early Protestant views of church history represented by Calvin and Luther and those modern Protestant views represented by Warfield. Warfield saw the early church, most basically, as a fall to be recovered from. He could even claim that “to pass from the latest apostolic writings to the earliest compositions of uninspired Christian pens is to fall through such a giddy height that it is no wonder if we rise dazed and almost unable to determine our whereabouts.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_30" id="ttf_16_30">30</a></sup> Luther and Calvin, by contrast, saw the early church as a resource to be utilized, and spoke of the goal of the Reformation as its retrieval.</p>
<p id="pz217-8">Granted, the Reformers were often cooler in their attitude toward medieval theology than patristic. Here we must neither downplay the Reformers’ critiques of medieval Christianity nor fail to appreciate their nuance. If we wonder, for instance, exactly what Calvin means when in his prefatory letter to King Francis he refers to Protestant doctrine as “laid long unknown and buried,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_31" id="ttf_16_31">31</a></sup> we get some clue later in the <i>Institutes</i> when he refers to the church of Gregory I’s day (at the turn of the seventh century) as “well-nigh collapsed” since it “had deteriorated much from its ancient purity.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_32" id="ttf_16_32">32</a></sup> Later he appears to regard the agreement between Pepin the Short and Pope Zachary in 751 as marking a new era of papal temporal power.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_33" id="ttf_16_33">33</a></sup> That Calvin regarded the papacy as falling further into apostasy and corruption from that point is clear from his assertion that the institution was in his own day “a hundred times more corrupt than it was it was in the times of Gregory and Bernard, though even then it greatly displeased those holy men.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_34" id="ttf_16_34">34</a></sup> One might plausibly conclude that Calvin saw the church as progressively degenerating throughout the medieval era. At the same time, Calvin staunchly denied that this degeneration ever resulted in death. In the context of developing his doctrine of the invisible church, Calvin rejected the possibility that the church “has been lifeless for some time,” <span id="z218-6">and affirmed from Matthew 28:20 that Christ preserves and defends the true church in every generation: “the church of Christ has lived and will live so long as Christ reigns at the right hand of the Father. It is sustained by his hand; defended by his protection; and is kept safe through his power.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_35" id="ttf_16_35">35</a></sup> It is therefore not surprising to find how much energy Calvin spends in the <i>Institutes</i> retrieving medieval theology. There is no major medieval theologian ignored, and he especially appreciates Gregory the Great, Peter Lombard, and Thomas Aquinas.</span></p>
<p id="pz218-7">Luther also, for all his anti-Rome rhetoric, always affirmed the preservation of the true church amidst seasons of corruption. Writing in the 1530s, he declared:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz218-8"><p class="blo">Today we still call the Church of Rome holy and all its sees holy, even though they have been undermined and their ministers are ungodly. . . . It is still the church. Although the city of Rome is worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, nevertheless there remains in it Baptism, the Sacrament, the voice and text of the Gospel, the Sacred Scriptures, the ministries, the name of Christ, and the name of God. . . . Therefore the Church of Rome is holy.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_36" id="ttf_16_36">36</a></sup></p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz218-9">Later Protestants would affirm and develop this doctrine of the preservation of the church, invoking the notion of a remnant ecclesiology. Francis Turretin, for example, in responding to the charge that the Reformed church did not exist before Luther and Zwingli, not only affirmed the true church’s persistence in various separatist movements from Rome, both in the East and West—he then supplemented this claim by insisting that “our church was in the papacy itself, inasmuch as God always preserved in the midst of Babylon a remnant for himself according to the election of grace.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_37" id="ttf_16_37">37</a></sup> The best of the later Protestant tradition continued to retrieve both patristic and medieval theology. The Puritan theologian John Owen, for instance, drew heavily from the logic, technical language, and metaphysical tradition of medieval theology, particularly that of Thomas Aquinas.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_38" id="ttf_16_38">38</a></sup> Carl Trueman <span id="z219-6">notes that Thomas influenced Owen on topics such as divine knowledge, divine providence, divine simplicity, election, and sin, and that from the earliest times in his career Owen drew upon Thomistic trajectories of thought (particularly as developed in the subsequent Dominican tradition) for polemical purposes in his arguments against Jesuits, Arminians, and Socinians.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_39" id="ttf_16_39">39</a></sup> While Owen certainly does not engage Thomas uncritically, he shows a penetrating grasp and respectful utilization of his theology.</span></p>
<p id="pz219-7">On the whole, the attitude toward patristic and medieval theology modeled by the Reformers, and later Protestants like Owen, is far more careful and generous than that entailed by Warfield’s metaphor of extracting leavened bread from the unleavened. The Reformers affirmed the preservation of the church in every generation; they drew widely from the wisdom of earlier generations; and they summed up their own goal as returning to the purity of the early church. The last thing in the world they intended was a wholesale rejection of the thirteen centuries separating John the apostle from John Wycliffe. As D. H. Williams put it, the mission of the Reformers was to point “not to themselves as the begetters of a new ‘protestantism’ but to the establishment of a proper catholicism—anti-Roman perhaps but not anti-catholic.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_40" id="ttf_16_40">40</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz219-8">But to say that Protestants can retrieve patristic and medieval theology is not yet to establish that they should. What makes such an endeavor, not merely permissible, but valuable?</p>
<h2 id="pz219-9">H<span class="smallcaps" id="AxIJ">OW</span> P<span class="smallcaps" id="Af62">ATRISTIC AND</span> M<span class="smallcaps" id="A7MR">EDIEVAL</span> T<span class="smallcaps" id="Aodr">HEOLOGY</span> C<span class="smallcaps" id="A9p4">AN</span> R<span class="smallcaps" id="AyLk">ESOURCE </span>C<span class="smallcaps" id="AYk7">ONTEMPORARY</span> P<span class="smallcaps" id="AqH6">ROTESTANTS</span></h2>
<p class="noind" id="pz219-10">It is difficult to quantify exactly what benefits retrieval can hold, and they may vary widely from one situation to the next. Nonetheless, we might draw attention to four ways that patristic and medieval theology is particularly well-positioned to interact with modern Protestant theology, without precluding other additional benefits as well. First, patristic and medieval theology can help bulk up contemporary Protestant theology in areas where it is historically weak or underdeveloped. A fitting metaphor for this benefit of retrieval might be a student attending a school, or a child <span id="z220-6">learning to talk by listening. This benefit of retrieval stems from the fact that each era of church history faces different theological controversies, and it is usually in the context of controversy that doctrinal precision tends to develop, often along with a shared technical vocabulary. Thus one need not regard church tradition as infallible or comprehensive to recognize that each generation of the church has a unique contribution to offer all the others.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_41" id="ttf_16_41">41</a></sup> In the case of our patristic and medieval forbearers, there are many doctrinal battles over which they agonized and even shed blood, doctrines that we rarely think about today.</span></p>
<p id="pz220-7">One example would be the doctrine of angels. The medieval era represents perhaps the richest period of reflection on angelology in the history of the church. Whereas modern Protestants generally have little use for angels beyond an interest, particularly in certain charismatic circles, in angels’ supernatural involvement in our lives, medieval theologians found great consequence in questions concerning the creation of angels, the nature of angels, the fall of angels, the role of angels in redemption, and the relation of angels to material creation. Many a page of Thomas Aquinas’s <i>Summa Theologica</i> is spent establishing that angels inhabit this universe as part of God’s creation along with material bodies, that they have a stewardship role over other material created bodies, that two angels cannot occupy the exact same place at the same time, that one angel cannot occupy two places at the same time, that the movement of an angel from one place in God’s creation to another is not instantaneous but requires a duration of time, that angels are capable of assuming a physical body, and other views such as these.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_42" id="ttf_16_42">42</a></sup> These were not idle, “ivory tower” questions for him, as they are often cast today, but they were integrally related to deeper theological matters concerning the nature of God’s creation and the relation of the spiritual and physical realms. Modern Protestants may develop more theologically satisfying ways of thinking about created realities like space and time and matter—particularly this side of Einstein—by cultivating curiosity for these questions that drove medieval angelology.</p>
<p id="pz220-8">This educational benefit is in some ways the most basic of theological retrieval, but it should not for that reason be considered the most valuable one. Almost invariably, theological retrieval serves a more catalytic role of deepening our sensitivities to theological concerns that we do not already <span id="z221-6">feel, and cultivating theological values that we do not already possess. To construct a metaphor, visiting the Sistine Chapel does more than conceptually advance your knowledge of Michaelango’s view of final judgment, just as visiting the Grand Canyon does more than provide you information about the history of the Colorado River. There are sensibilities and emotions that are shaped by the whole experience. So also patristic and medieval theology can bolster the theological values and inclinations we lack if we work narrowly within Reformation and modern theology alongside the Bible.</span></p>
<p id="pz221-7">An example of this kind of retrieval can be found within the doctrine of God, and particularly those areas within theology proper that are intrinsic to the divine essence, such as divine simplicity and divine impassibility. Despite being fairly consistent throughout all of church history, East and West, these doctrines are increasingly ignored or rejected within modern Protestantism. More than that, modern theologians and philosophers tend to critique these doctrines for reasons that all too often did not even come into view in their premodern articulations. How do we account for this discrepancy? Retrieving the doctrine of God in its patristic and medieval context helps explain these differing instincts by calling attention to the deeper ontological differences at stake, and thereby helps sensitize us to the values that drove ancient formulations of these doctrines.</p>
<p id="pz221-8">With respect to divine simplicity, the influence of Plotinus and (later) Pseudo-Dionysius can be detected in the church’s habitual instinct to reason that if God is the cause of being then God must be logically prior to being.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_43" id="ttf_16_43">43</a></sup> Thus, in the West, Boethius called the divine essence “beyond being” and “super-substantial,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_44" id="ttf_16_44">44</a></sup> and in the East, John of Damascus referred to God as “the super-essential-essence, the Godhead that is more than God, the beginning that is above beginning.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_45" id="ttf_16_45">45</a></sup> While early and medieval theologians rejected the equivocal relationship between Creator and creation that Muslim and Jewish philosophers would come to employ,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_46" id="ttf_16_46">46</a></sup> they equally resisted a univocal relationship in which God and the world are ultimately <span id="z222-6">on the same scale of being (as often assumed in some contemporary critiques of divine simplicity). Aquinas made it presuppositional in <i>Summa Theologica</i> that God and creation belong to different ontological frameworks, since God is the author of all being: “God is not related to creatures as though belonging to a different <i>genus</i>, but as transcending every <i>genus</i>, and as the principle of all <i>genera</i>.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_47" id="ttf_16_47">47</a></sup> One might summarize the consequence of the early church’s preference of an analogical correlation of God and creation over a univocal one like this: where modern theology often regards God as subsisting within a larger structure of reality, classical theology regarded reality itself as subsisting within the being of God.</span></p>
<p id="pz222-7">Because patristic and medieval theologians had a high view of God’s transcendence over the world, they emphasized divine hiddenness and mysteriousness and, thus, were careful in applying the language and logic of created beings to God. Augustine, for instance, warns in <i>De Trinitate</i>, “whatever is said of a nature, unchangeable, invisible and having life absolutely and sufficient to itself, must not be measured after the custom of things visible, and changeable, and mortal, or not self-sufficient.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_48" id="ttf_16_48">48</a></sup> While they believed true knowledge of God could be obtained, and (contrary to Maimonides) that God does not have essential attributes, they placed enormous emphasis on divine incomprehensibility, almost as a controlling influence in their doctrine of God. Basil, for instance, warns his readers against applying “arithmetic” to the divine essence, calling God “the Unapproachable One” who is “beyond numbers,” and commending the Hebrew practice of abstaining from mentioning God’s name out of reverence for it.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_49" id="ttf_16_49">49</a></sup> Gregory of Nazianzus stipulated that in doing theology, “our starting-point must be the fact that God cannot be named,” also commending the Hebrew practice of using special symbols to venerate the divine name.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_50" id="ttf_16_50">50</a></sup> So also Anselm, in his <i>Proslogion</i>, uses the motif of “inaccessible light” as his running image for God, continually begging God for cleansing and illumination until he finally arrives upon divine simplicity as the answer to the question, “what shall my heart understand you to be?”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_51" id="ttf_16_51">51</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz223-6">Reading these accounts of divine simplicity pulls us into a larger context of concerns than are typically present in contemporary treatments of this doctrine. Even if we ultimately end up rejecting a doctrine like divine simplicity, engaging its treatment in patristic and medieval theology can deepen our appreciation of the values that have typically undergirded it and, by drawing attention to the deeper ontological issues involved in its formulation, help us understand why it has made sense to those who affirmed it.</p>
<p id="pz223-7">A third example of how the retrieval of patristic and medieval theology can resource contemporary Protestant theology is reframing modern debates by providing a premodern perspective. Specifically, because it operates in a premodern context without a “liberal versus conservative” spectrum as such, pre-Reformation theology can help redirect us away from some of the limiting features that tend to characterize polarized contexts. If our previous metaphors have been going to school and going on a holiday, our metaphor for this kind of retrieval is going to see a counselor to get an outside perspective on your family history. Just as a counselor gives you a perspective on yourself that you might not otherwise have, so contact with the broader Christian tradition can be an illuming influence that exposes modern eccentricities in different directions: both a ninteenth century liberal and a twentieth century fundamentalist would find their theological method seriously challenged if they could travel back in a time machine to, say, the ninth century.</p>
<p id="pz223-8">An example of this kind of retrieval would be Augustine of Hippo’s doctrine of creation. It is often claimed that the twenty-four-hour-day view is the unbroken consensus of the church until nineteenth century and that “nonliteral” readings come up at that point simply as accommodations to modern evolutionary theory.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_52" id="ttf_16_52">52</a></sup> But Augustine reveals that there have always been those who interpreted Genesis 1 differently, for reasons having nothing to do with evidence for an older earth and older universe, but rather because of details in the text itself.</p>
<p id="pz223-9">In his early allegorical work against the Manichees, Augustine treated the days of creation as predictions of the redemptive-historical future,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_53" id="ttf_16_53">53</a></sup> and <span id="z224-6">then as various stages of the Christian life.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_54" id="ttf_16_54">54</a></sup> His later “literal” reading of Genesis was not intended to exclude allegorical meaning in the text but to relate it to the historical past. Here Augustine maintains that while ordinary twenty-four-hour days may “represent” the original creation days in some respects, “we must be in no doubt that they are not at all like them, but very, very different.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_55" id="ttf_16_55">55</a></sup> Augustine held that the details of Genesis 1 are not intended to convey its timing or sequence at all, since God created all things simultaneously.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_56" id="ttf_16_56">56</a></sup> God’s act of creation is depicted in terms of a human workweek, in Augustine’s view, as a literary device for the sake of those who cannot understand the notion of simultaneous creation in order to lead them progressively to the understanding of the work of creation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_57" id="ttf_16_57">57</a></sup> In other words, for Augustine, the portrayal of God’s creative work in seven days is an accommodation to human finitude. Augustine held this view not because of abstract philosophical principles but because of various features in the text—particularly the nature of the light in the first three days before the creation of the luminaries on day four, the difficulty of God resting on the seventh day, and the timing of the creation of angels in relation to Genesis 1.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_58" id="ttf_16_58">58</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz224-7">Augustine does regard Genesis 1–3 as having genuine historical reference, distinguishing its genre from Song of Solomon and likening it rather to the book of Kings.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_59" id="ttf_16_59">59</a></sup> He affirms a historical Adam and an Eden that is a real geographical environment, leaving only the caveat that “if the bodily things mentioned here could not in any way at all be taken in a bodily sense that accorded with truth, what other course would we have but to understand them as spoken figuratively, rather than impiously to find fault with holy scripture?”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_60" id="ttf_16_60">60</a></sup> Augustine criticizes the stubborn insistence on <span id="z225-6">taking textual details figuratively when it is possible to understand them historically.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_61" id="ttf_16_61">61</a></sup> At the same time, Augustine’s use of the term “historical” is qualified by his emphasis on the fact that the act of creation is an utterly unique and unrepeatable event beyond our current knowledge, experience, and language.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_62" id="ttf_16_62">62</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz225-7">Augustine was not the first to approach the text in this way; earlier “nonliteral” readings can be found, for instance, in Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Didymus the Blind, and Athanasius.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_63" id="ttf_16_63">63</a></sup> But it was Augustine’s view, particularly as qualified later by Gregory the Great, and propagated by both Isidore of Seville and Bede, that had the greatest influence in the subsequent Western church.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_64" id="ttf_16_64">64</a></sup> In fact, Augustine’s view was so significant for the medieval discussion that Anselm in the eleventh century could refer to the doctrine of instantaneous creation as the “prevailing opinion” of his day.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_65" id="ttf_16_65">65</a></sup> Thus both Augustine and the tradition of interpretation that followed in his influence should caution us against supposing that twenty-four-hour interpretations are universal throughout premodern Christianity.</p>
<p id="pz225-8">A fourth and final example of the benefit of patristic and medieval retrieval is that it opens avenues of agreement and synthesis between seemingly conflicting theological options. This method of retrieval is similar to the previous one. Likewise, it applies past doctrine specifically to current theological disagreements. But this benefit has a more aggressive purpose: here the counselor is not merely providing perspective but is actively seeking to reconcile two parties. A metaphor for this benefit might be that of a guide, showing the way out of a dead end or gridlock in which one appears otherwise hopelessly lost. An example of this kind of retrieval would be the attempt to bring about rapprochement between various competing models of the atonement in contemporary theology by exploring how they worked in harmony in patristic and medieval thought.</p>
<p id="pz225-9">Contemporary discussion of the doctrine of the atonement is often organized around the rejection or defense of various species of “objective” <span id="z226-6">models of the atonement (especially those involving an affirmation of penal substitution). There is a particular turn in the literature toward an Irenaean/Athanasian <i>recapitulation</i> model of the atonement as an alternative to Anselmian <i>satisfaction</i> models, which are regarded as violent, juridical, and focused on the cross at the expense of Christ’s life and resurrection.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_66" id="ttf_16_66">66</a></sup> But in reading Irenaeus and Athanasius themselves, one finds statements about Christ’s crucifixion that sound very Anselmian; and in reading Anselm himself, one finds statements about Christ’s birth that sounds very Eastern. Reading these theologians in their own context may help us conceptualize an atonement theology in a recapitulatory account of the incarnation and a satisfaction account of his death might be better taken to complement one another, rather than be set at odds with one another.</span></p>
<p id="pz226-7">For example, while the emphasis of Irenaeus’s <i>Adversus Haereses</i> is on Christ’s entire recapitulatory life as spreading divine immortality to humanity and thus restoring human nature, within this schema Christ’s death plays a critical role, as does the motif of substitution that corresponds to it. For instance, one piece of the larger Adam-Christ typology that runs throughout the book is Irenaeus’s correlation of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil with Christ’s cross. In this context he can makes statements like the following: “the Lord thus has redeemed us through His own blood, giving His soul for our souls, and His flesh for our flesh, and has also poured out the Spirit of the Father for the union and communion of God and man.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_67" id="ttf_16_67">67</a></sup> In his <i>On the Apostolic Teaching</i>, Irenaeus offers an extended engagement with Isaiah 53, emphasizing the necessity of Christ’s scourges and physical tortures for his accomplishment of our salvation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_68" id="ttf_16_68">68</a></sup> Reflecting specifically on Isaiah 53:8, Irenaeus affirms that Christ’s death on the cross <span id="z227-6">was vicarious for believers even though it signals the final condemnation of unbelievers: “the judgment has been taken from the believers in Him, and they are no longer under it.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_69" id="ttf_16_69">69</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz227-7">Athanasius also affirms Christ’s substitutionary death as a harmonious part of the doctrine of recapitulation. For example, <a href="chapter10.xhtml">chapter 4</a> of <i>De Incarnatione</i> focuses more explicitly on Christ’s death:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz227-8"><p class="blo">But beyond all this, there was a debt owing which needs be paid; for, as I said before, all men were due to die. Here, then, is the second reason why the Word dwelt among us, namely that having proved His Godhead by His works, He might offer the sacrifice (θυσιαν) on behalf of all, surrendering his own temple to death in place of all, to settle man’s account with death and free him from the primal transgression (αρχαιας παραβασεως).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_70" id="ttf_16_70">70</a></sup></p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz227-9">The substitutionary language used here with reference to Christ’s death (“on behalf of all” and “in place of all”) combined with the legal language and imagery used to interpret that act of substitution (“debt owing which needs be paid” and “to settle man’s account”) suggest something like a satisfaction account of atonement. Athanasius uses sacrificial and substitutionary language throughout <i>De Incarnatione</i> to refer to the act of Christ’s crucifixion—he calls it an “offering” and “sacrifice” to the Father, as well as a “substitute” and an “exchange” and an “equivalent” (i.e., of the death of his “brethren”),<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_71" id="ttf_16_71">71</a></sup> such that “in His death all might die.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_72" id="ttf_16_72">72</a></sup> Later, affirming from Galatians 3:13 that Christ had to “become a curse for us,” he calls Christ’s death our “ransom.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_73" id="ttf_16_73">73</a></sup> At the same time, when Athanasius speaks of Christ taking our punishment, his emphasis is on the penalty of <i>death</i>, and less on Christ bearing specifically the penalties of guilt and/or punishment.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_74" id="ttf_16_74">74</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz228-6">Furthermore, Anselm’s <i>Cur Deus Homo</i> has a remarkably similar account of the recapitulatory role of Christ’s incarnate birth as is found in Irenaeus’s <i>Adversus Haereses</i>. Anselm declares that the union between divine and human forged at the incarnation fundamentally altered human nature: “There was [not] any degradation of God in his Incarnation; rather, we believe that human nature was exalted.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_75" id="ttf_16_75">75</a></sup> For Anselm, when Christ assumed a sinless human being from the sinful mass at the incarnation, “God restored human nature more wonderfully than he first established it.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_76" id="ttf_16_76">76</a></sup> Moreover, like Irenaeus, Anselm defines this restoration of human nature in terms of an Adam-Christ typology, such that Christ’s obedient life brought about the immortality that was originally lost through Adam’s disobedience: “it was fitting that just as death entered the human race through the disobedience of a human being, so too life should be restored by the obedience of a human being.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_77" id="ttf_16_77">77</a></sup> Thus, for Anselm, as for Irenaeus, the doctrine of atonement is drawn from the doctrine of creation. Anselm holds that the incarnation accomplished what would have happened if Adam and Eve had not sinned, namely, the completion and transformation of human nature into incorruptibility. And it is in <i>this</i> context that satisfaction themes are introduced in the middle and later sections of the book. He argues, for example, that a “perfect recompense for sin” was required, not satisfy some arbitrary legal demand, but rather in order that God “complete what he began in human nature.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_78" id="ttf_16_78">78</a></sup> Here and elsewhere, recompense for sin complements the larger theme of the restoration of human nature to the blessed immortality for which it was originally designed. Thus satisfaction serves recapitulation; forgiveness serves flourishing: “remission of sins is necessary for human beings if they are to attain happiness.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_79" id="ttf_16_79">79</a></sup> As the Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart puts it, “In the end Anselm merely restates the oldest patristic model of atonement of all: recapitulation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_80" id="ttf_16_80">80</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz228-7">Our survey of these theologians demonstrates the possibility of a doctrine of atonement that can hold an affirmation of Christ’s life as recapitulating human nature together with an affirmation of Christ’s death as satisfying divine honor or wrath. There is no obvious conceptual incompatibility <span id="z229-6">between recapitulation and satisfaction. In fact, they may even be seen as mutually explanatory. As Hans Boersma notes, for example, recapitulation is a formal concept, while the traditional atonement models (including penal substitution) are material concepts—recapitulation tells the broader aim of Christ’s atonement, but not how he actually brings it about.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_81" id="ttf_16_81">81</a></sup> Furthermore, both recapitulation and satisfaction can be logically integrated under the broader rubric of <i>substitution</i>: Christ both sums up our humanity, and bears our sins, via the mechanism of self-substitution.</span></p>

<p class="noind" id="pz229-8">Finally, having provided some reflections on why Protestants should retrieve patristic and medieval theology and some of the benefits that may arise from such an endeavor, we conclude by identifying three early medieval texts/figures that may be particularly profitable for modern Protestants to retrieve. These three figures stand out not only because modern Protestants tend to neglect them, but also because they were hugely influential in previous generations of the church. In other words, modern Protestants are eccentric within the church catholic for <i>not</i> retrieving them.</p>
<p id="pz229-9">The first example is Boethius’s <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i>. Written in the early sixth century while Boethius was in prison awaiting execution, <i>The Consolation</i> became arguably the single most translated and most influential text outside the Bible from the medieval into the modern era, so much so that in the twentieth century C. S. Lewis could declare, “until about two hundred years ago it would, I think, have been hard to find an educated man in any European country who did not love it.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_82" id="ttf_16_82">82</a></sup> And yet today Boethius is often regarded as an unoriginal thinker whose main contribution was to transmit Aristotle to the medieval era.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_83" id="ttf_16_83">83</a></sup> Moreover, when <i>The Consolation</i> is engaged, it is often seen as a strictly philosophical work with little theological content, since throughout the book Boethius dialogues <span id="z230-6">with “Lady Philosophy,” and there are relatively few explicit references to God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_84" id="ttf_16_84">84</a></sup> But Boethius was in fact an innovative theologian in his own right, and for him, as for much patristic and medieval theology, philosophy functioned as a handmaiden to, not a replacement of, theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_85" id="ttf_16_85">85</a></sup> For modern Protestants Boethius may be a particularly helpful figure for sharpening their doctrine of God, particularly with respect to the Creator-creation distinction, divine simplicity, divine foreknowledge, and the relation of eternity and time. Boethius also affirms a doctrine of human happiness that may counterbalance the more austere outlook that often characterizes the Puritan strand of the Protestant tradition.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_86" id="ttf_16_86">86</a></sup> Furthermore, because of its profoundly formative role upon the medieval church, <i>The Consolation</i> may function for modern Protestants as a helpful introduction to that whole era. As Lewis put it, “To acquire a taste for [<i>The Consolation</i>] is almost to become naturalised in the Middle Ages.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_87" id="ttf_16_87">87</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz230-7">A second example is Gregory the Great’s <i>The Book of Pastoral Rule</i>. An important pope at the turn of the seventh century, Gregory was a capable administrator whose reforms and initiatives marked the church for centuries. But Gregory regarded himself as primarily a religious leader, and his greatest influence was arguably upon the church’s liturgy, monastic organization, and theology. Like Boethius, his influence was particularly felt by the medieval church, and he was respected by the Reformers as well.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_88" id="ttf_16_88">88</a></sup> Chris Armstrong claims no Western father was read more by the medieval church, suggesting that “if Augustine of Hippo was the father of <span id="z231-6">medieval theology, then Gregory was the father of medieval spirituality.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_89" id="ttf_16_89">89</a></sup> But Gregory was also a profound theologian who himself appropriated and extended much of Augustine’s thought.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_90" id="ttf_16_90">90</a></sup> Moreover, in Gregory’s capacity as papal representative to the Byzantine emperor, he lived in a Latin district of Constantinople for almost seven years, and thus his theology was uniquely shaped by, and interactive with, the theology of the Eastern church. As George Demacopoulos notes, after reading <i>The Book of Pastoral Rule</i>, the Byzantine emperor Maurice ordered that the book be translated and disseminated to every bishop in his empire.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_91" id="ttf_16_91">91</a></sup> Gregory is the only Latin father whose works were translated into Greek within his own lifetime.</span></p>
<p id="pz231-7">The <i>Book of Pastoral Rule</i> argues that pastoral ministry requires a delicate balance of inner and outer qualities—theory and practice, contemplation and activity, a holy detachment from the affairs of the world and a practical skill at engaging those affairs. This dual focus reflected Gregory’s own life, in which he had been drawn into various administrative and leadership roles despite his constant desire for the contemplative life. As a result, Gregory’s <i>Rule</i> has a particularly practical thrust. Comparable works of pastoral theology in the Protestant tradition tend to focus on qualifications for pastoral ministry, and godliness in ministry (one thinks of Baxter’s <i>The Reformed Pastor</i>, for instance, or Spurgeon’s <i>Lectures to My Students</i>). While these are emphases of Gregory’s also (parts 1 and 2 of his book, respectively), the greater portion of Gregory’s text concerns practical matters—its treatment of how a pastor should teach different kinds of people differently in part 3, the lengthiest section of the book, is particularly full of wisdom, and Protestants may find this book supplementing the emphases of their typical literature on pastoral theology, particularly as it is generally neglected among modern Protestants.</p>
<p id="pz231-8">A final example is John of Damascus’s various writings on the iconoclast controversy. Living in the East in the eighth century, John follows and sums up early Eastern theology, especially that of the Cappadocian fathers, such that Andrew Louth calls him the “pre-eminent representative of the <span id="z232-6">Byzantine theological tradition.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_92" id="ttf_16_92">92</a></sup> Yet John has frequently been isolated from the Western theological tradition. Apart from a few references in florilegia, he was basically unknown in the West until his <i>Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith</i> was translated into Latin in the twelfth century, which was then heavily utilized by Peter Lombard and Thomas Aquinas. Its subsequent influence was such that Peter Toon characterizes it as “important in the creation of Western medieval theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_93" id="ttf_16_93">93</a></sup> Nonetheless, John’s broader writings on the iconoclast controversy, arguably his greatest theological legacy, remained largely unknown, and the later Protestant iconoclasm (particularly in the tradition following Calvin’s vigorous denunciation of icons) have only further removed John from Protestant consciousness.</span></p>
<p id="pz232-7">Retrieving John’s theology thus brings modern Protestants into contact with a whole stream of Christendom that is all too often completely lost to us.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_94" id="ttf_16_94">94</a></sup> The sheer size and diversity of this slice of Christendom begs for retrieval, and John’s writings on the iconoclast controversy are perhaps the most sensible entry point into it, since it was this dispute that dominated the Eastern church in the eighth and first half of the ninth centuries. John’s defense of the use of icons against the charge of idolatry was grounded principally in the doctrine of the incarnation, emphasizing that Christ’s flesh was not a mere garment but was truly united to incorruptible divinity even while it retained its fleshly status.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_95" id="ttf_16_95">95</a></sup> Moreover, John maintained that all human thought about the divine is inherently pictorial. As a result, rejecting the use of images did not simply threaten one particular devotional practice, but confused the whole task of theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_16_96" id="ttf_16_96">96</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz232-8">As a result of this controversy, the Eastern church was compelled to <span id="z233-1">develop a rich theology of art and a high view of the material world, grounded in theological reflection about the nature of the incarnation. For evangelicals, who often have a very shallow view of the arts, and who tend to pit the spiritual and the physical against one another, John’s writings may prompt deeper reflection on what our status as embodied creatures entails for the nature of theology.</span></p>

Yarnell III, <i>The Formation of Christian Doctrine</i> (Nashville: B&amp;H, 2007), 150–65, esp. 157–58. Yarnell rejects the notion of the invisible church as articulated by Herman Bavinck (54–56); he believes that classical ecclesiology, including its Reformed and evangelical expressions (e.g., that of John Webster) must be rejected (xiv, 62–67); and he expresses concerns about other Baptist calls for ecumenicity, such as those of Timothy George (71). For a helpful critique of the notion of the fall of the church, see D. H. Williams, <i>Retrieving the Tradition and Renewing Evangelicalism: A Primer for Suspicious Protestants</i> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999), 103–72. For a briefer overview and critique, see Bryan M. Litfin, <i>Getting to Know the Church Fathers: An Evangelical Introduction</i>, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2016), 13–16.</span></p>

Holmes, <i>Listening to the Past: The Place of Tradition in Theology</i> (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2002), 5–36, who argues that theology must engage tradition because of our historical locatedness as temporal creatures, and because of our status as members in the larger community of saints, past and present.

Her presence indicates not the absence of God, but the presence of such a high view of God that he cannot be dialogued with directly, in the way Boethius wants to do.</span></p>

E.g., <i>Inst</i>. 4.7.22 (1141). It is frequently claimed that Calvin called Gregory the “last good Pope,” but I have not been able to find any proper documentation of where this occurs—it is generally cited without page number from book 4 of the <i>Institutes</i>, ed. by F.L.

During the High Middle Ages, Constantinople, the seat of the Byzantine Empire, was the greatest city in Europe. Within her history lies more than a millennium of rich theological reflection, in addition to important political and ecclesiastical developments, such as missionary efforts to India and China. For a helpful introduction to Eastern Christianity during its development away from the Western church, see Andrew Louth, <i>Greek East and Latin West: The Church AD 681–1071</i>, The Church in History 3 (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 2007).</span></p>
