<p class="noind" id="pAOhW">Of talking about many things, as the making of many books, there is no end (see Eccl 12:12). Theology is “talk about God” (the <i>logos</i> of <i>theos</i>), yet there are many kinds of theology, including pastoral, biblical, historical, and systematic. There is also misleading talk of God, not only the idle talk of idolaters but also the false “teachings of demons” (1 Tim 4:1).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_1" id="ttf_07_1">1</a></sup> This essay treats yet another variety of theology, dogmatics. Indeed, the goal is to give a dogmatic account of the project of dogmatics itself, along the lines of John Webster’s theological account of theology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_2" id="ttf_07_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p id="pAii">Let me define dogmatics provisionally as the church’s attempt to employ its own resources (e.g., Scripture, tradition) to issue binding statements concerning who God <i>is</i> and what God <i>is doing</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_3" id="ttf_07_3">3</a></sup> In particular, dogmatics sets <span id="z24-6">forth in speech what God is doing in Christ. Stated even more succinctly: dogmatics says <i>what is</i> “in Christ.” As we shall see, however, saying what is in Christ cannot be abstracted from having the mind of Christ and walking in the way of Christ. While the task of dogmatics involves setting out faith’s <i>content</i> (“the good deposit,” 2 Tim 1:14), it also involves the <i>forms</i> of language, experience, and thought that communicate it. Dogmatic discourse involves not only <i>what</i> we say about God (content) but <i>how</i> we say it (form).</span></p>
<p id="pz24-7">Which comes first in dogmatics: a certain kind of experience, reflection, or language? The relationship between concepts (thought), percepts (experience), and words (language) has been at the center of modern debates about meaning and truth. The poet Christian Wiman wonders whether the decay of belief among educated Westerners precedes the decay of language: “Do we find the fire of belief fading in us only because the words are sodden with overuse and imprecision, and will not burn?”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_4" id="ttf_07_4">4</a></sup> Immanuel Kant complicated the dogmatic task by claiming that experience and language, especially concepts, only get as far as a knowledge of appearances, not reality. Consequently, content-oriented dogmatics has been in the doghouse for much of modernity. Friedrich Schleiermacher accepted the Kantian limits, insisting that the piety that forms the basis of the church is a matter neither of knowing or doing, but rather of feeling (i.e., the consciousness of being related to God).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_5" id="ttf_07_5">5</a></sup> Hence his famous definition: “Christian doctrines are accounts of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_6" id="ttf_07_6">6</a></sup> Feelings, religious affections, and consciousness are all modes of human subjectivity, and sure enough Schleiermacher declares, “the description of human states of mind to be the fundamental dogmatic form.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_7" id="ttf_07_7">7</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz24-8">Schleiermacher falls easy prey to Ludwig Feuerbach’s suspicion that underneath every theological statement there lurks an anthropological truth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_8" id="ttf_07_8">8</a></sup> By way of contrast, the present essay views the task of Christian dogmatics as speaking and reflecting not about our own experience primarily—even if those experiences are experiences of redemption by Jesus Christ—but rather about who God is and what God is doing. Dogmatics obliges us to <span id="z25-6">do more (but not less) than talk about ourselves.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_9" id="ttf_07_9">9</a></sup> I agree with John Webster: dogmatics is the study that has the being and agency of God not only for its subject matter but also for its very condition of possibility. What we need, perhaps going beyond Webster, is a dogmatic account of how all three—experience, thought, and language—come together in statements of what is in Christ.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_10" id="ttf_07_10">10</a></sup> In sum, what we need is a <i>poetics</i> of dogmatics.</span></p>

<p class="noind" id="AmR">Robert Jenson says the church’s mission is “to see to the speaking of the gospel.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_11" id="ttf_07_11">11</a></sup> The material content of the gospel deserves pride of place, although in a “post-truth” age we do well “to see to the speaking,” that is, both what is said and how it is said—hence the present reflection on the nature and function of language in dogmatic reasoning and, in particular, the ways in which language brokers the complex relationships between experience and thought. To see what I’m talking about, consider an example from another discipline: mathematics.</p>
<p id="pz25-8"><i>The Man Who Knew Infinity</i> is a novel (now a major motion picture with Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons) that tells the true story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician who gained admittance to Cambridge University to work with the renowned Englishman Professor G. H. Hardy. Ramanujan was a devout Hindu for whom mathematical discovery resembled a process of mystical vision. He claimed that all his discoveries were revealed: “An equation to me,” he famously said, “has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.” By contrast, his Cambridge mentor, while recognizing Ramanujan’s genius, insisted on his supplying step-by-step clarifications of his seminal ideas about numbers. The novel details the way in which Hardy, “the Apostle of Proof,” engaged Ramanujan, “the Prince of Intuition.”</p>
<p id="pz25-9">The story turns largely on what we might describe as a conflict of mathematical poetics: an intuitive imagination that yearns for not a beatific but an arithmetic vision on the one hand, and an analytic reason satisfied with <span id="z26-6">nothing less than the long way of axiomatic demonstration on the other. Hardy once said that Ramanujan had “a feeling for form,” and this is a good description of poetic sensibility. Even in a discipline like mathematics there are connections between forms of seeing, experiencing, and thinking. Well, what about dogmatics? Where should we locate its discourse on the linguistic spectrum between analytic demonstration and poetic intuition?</span></p> <br/> 
<h3 id="pz26-7"><i>T<span class="smallcaps" id="AGE1">HE</span> N<span class="smallcaps" id="A2mZ">ATURE OF</span> D<span class="smallcaps" id="AY92">OGMATIC</span> D<span class="smallcaps" id="AjjT">ISCOURSE</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz26-8">There is a poetics of theology as there is in mathematics—a variety of ways to experience, think, and speak about the infinity (of God). Perfect being theologians purport to set forth in speech the properties of a being so great that none greater can be conceived—a being of infinite perfection.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_12" id="ttf_07_12">12</a></sup> Setting forth in speech the properties of such a being is not quite the project of dogmatics, which attends not merely to the concept of infinite perfection but, more specifically, the triune God—and to what Emily Dickinson describes as “the infinite a sudden guest” (a reference to the historical incarnation), and what Ed Oakes’s recent Christology describes as “infinity dwindled to infancy.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_13" id="ttf_07_13">13</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz26-9">Neither can dogmatics be content with an apophaticism that speaks of infinity only by saying what it is not. For the biblical discourse of the prophets and apostles that generates and governs Christian dogmatics is largely cataphatic, describing in positive terms (even if they are anthropomorphisms) “that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life” (1 John 1:1).</p>
<p id="pz26-10">Christian dogmatics is not a speculative discourse that begins from or limits itself by means of an abstract concept of infinity. It is rather a response to a prior divine communicative initiative.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_14" id="ttf_07_14">14</a></sup> We speak truly of God because God first spoke to us. Dogmatics exists in and under what John Webster calls “the domain of the Word”: God’s communicative and self-communicative activity. Defining dogmatics as “talk about God” does not go far enough; other forms of discourse speak of God (often in vain). <span id="z27-6">Webster rightly identifies the distinctiveness of dogmatics “in its invocation of God as agent in the intellectual practice of theology.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_15" id="ttf_07_15">15</a></sup> God is Lord of his Word—its form (poetics) and content (analytics)—as well as its hearing. And, out of his lordly love and freedom, God has decided to communicate a share of his infinite knowledge of himself with those he created in his image.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_16" id="ttf_07_16">16</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz27-7">Humans may not be capable of experiencing, knowing, and saying the infinite, yet the infinite is capable of humanity: <i>infinitum capax finiti</i>, or rather “the Word became flesh” (John 1:14). Specifically, God the Son, the “form of God” (Phil 2:6), took on the “form of a servant” (Phil 2:7). The communicative agency of the triune God is the enabling condition of Christian dogmatics: not philosophical anthropology, epistemology, or even hermeneutics. In the economy of divine light, Christ is the human surface that mirrors the Father, who otherwise dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim 6:16). God is both subject matter (object) and active agent (subject) of dogmatics. Theologians too are subjects of intellectual acts—of biblical interpretation, historical inquiry, conceptual elaboration, and as we shall see, confessions of faith—but their activity originates, is sustained, and is illumined by a divine communicative activity that encompasses them.</p> <br/>

<p class="noind" id="pz27-10">For Karl Barth, the task of dogmatics is to examine how far church proclamation corresponds to or agrees with the Word of God: “Dogmatics is the church’s evaluation of its own utterance by its own given norm of revelation.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_17" id="ttf_07_17">17</a></sup> Dogmatics is a function of the hearing and teaching church. In hearing, the church must hearken first and foremost to God’s Word: no dogmatics can serve two masters. In teaching, the church must speak. It must proclaim and exposit the content of the gospel: the self-communicative action of the triune God, the revelation of the Father’s reconciliation in Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. Barth views dogmatics as the science of the Word of God, whose form and content is Jesus Christ.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_18" id="ttf_07_18">18</a></sup> Dogmatics is <span id="z28-6">scientific to the extent that it lets its object determine the way it comes to be known and spoken of.</span></p>
<p id="pz28-7">Similarly, Herman Bavinck conceives dogmatic theology as the science of the knowledge of God and his creatures as they stand in relation to him. God reveals this knowledge, humans receive it by faith through the Spirit, and this faith is nurtured in particular ecclesial contexts. However, Bavinck distinguishes “symbolics” (the exposition of what a church in fact confesses) from dogmatics, the assessment what the church <i>ought</i> to confess. In Bavinck’s words: “dogmatic theology dogmatizes, i.e., it sets forth . . . what ought to count as truth.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_19" id="ttf_07_19">19</a></sup> Both Barth and Bavinck would agree with Jaroslav Pelikan’s definition of dogma as “a formal, official, public, and binding statement of what is believed and confessed by the church.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_20" id="ttf_07_20">20</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz28-8">John Webster has roused many of us from our nondogmatic slumbers, awakening us to the bracing prospect of speaking of God in himself (i.e., his perfect life as a fellowship of Father, Son, and Spirit) as well as speaking of his external operations (e.g., creation, providence, redemption). Here too, the focus is on God’s communicative agency, and on “the continuous identity of the acting subject in God’s inner and outer works.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_21" id="ttf_07_21">21</a></sup> This is heady stuff, for theology under the house arrest of modernity was not allowed to make claims that transcended human spatiotemporal experience. Webster does not deny the ectypal nature of human knowledge of God: we do not know God the way God knows God. Yet acknowledging theology as ectypal (i.e., accommodated to human minds and contexts) need not result in the self-destruction of dogmatics, much less its deconstruction. On the contrary, a dogmatic account of dogmatic discourse acknowledges the limitations of the human intellect “but places them within the sphere of God’s communicative and saving causality.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_22" id="ttf_07_22">22</a></sup></p>

<p class="noind" id="pz28-10">Hopefully by now I’ve established my Websterian bona fides. I am on board with his notion that while we may need to begin with the economy (God’s external works in space and time), in a material sense “theology proper [the consideration of God’s perfect life in itself ] precedes and governs the <span id="z29-6">economy.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_23" id="ttf_07_23">23</a></sup> Webster insists that the God who is with us and for us in his works in the world is the one who enjoys perfect life in himself. Triune perfection establishes and enables triune presence.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_24" id="ttf_07_24">24</a></sup> Getting a better handle on this marvel—our ability to speak well of God’s existence <i>in se</i>—is one of my reasons for attempting a dogmatic account of dogmatic discourse.</span></p>
<p id="pz29-7">What makes talk of God count as properly dogmatic discourse? The Gospels include technically true statements about Jesus that fall short of the dogmatic mark. Consider, for example, Jesus’s encounters with demons, like the one in Luke 4, where the evil spirits of a man possessed cry out “Go away! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? . . . I know who you are—the Holy One of God” (Luke 4:34). This was hardly an isolated incident: “And demons also came out of many, crying, ‘You are the Son of God!’ ” (Luke 4:41). James 2:19 says: “You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder [from <i>phrissō</i> (cf. <i>frisson</i>)].” How, then, should we explain the difference between demonic and dogmatic discourse? As we shall see, it has something to do with the relationship between forms of experience, thought, and language. Dogmatics involves not only propositions but doxastic attitudes (i.e., faith) and obedient actions (i.e., works) too. By way of contrast, those who do not believe God “went after false idols and became false” (2 Kings 17:15), illustrating what we may call the poetics of unbelief.</p>
<p id="pz29-8">Concepts stand at the intersection of language and thought and are the workhorses of dogmatic theology. What is the status of categories that are not explicitly used by biblical authors? We’ve all heard of the Hellenization thesis, according to which Greek philosophical categories corrupted the pure narrative simplicity of the Gospels, but Ann Moss’s “Latinization” thesis may be less familiar.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_25" id="ttf_07_25">25</a></sup> Moss argues that language change was “of overriding importance in Renaissance humanism’s refashioning of the mentality of Western Europe.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_26" id="ttf_07_26">26</a></sup> The Renaissance humanists introduced a new type of Latin, in contrast to the Latin of medieval scholasticism. Their goal was to have the humanist schoolboy “speak, write, and think as if he were an integrated member of the same speech community as Cicero <span id="z30-6">and Virgil.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_27" id="ttf_07_27">27</a></sup> Moss may be doing Renaissance history, but she has bought into, and imported, the twentieth-century turn to language: the idea that “our modes of perception and our ways of organizing our thoughts and experience [are] conditioned, determined even, by the language(s) in which they operate.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_28" id="ttf_07_28">28</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="pz30-7">Ought we to say something similar about dogmatics? Is its mission to train today’s evangelical seminarians to speak, write, and think as if they were an integrated member of the same speech community as Athanasius or Calvin? One of my former doctoral students, now teaching in the Philippines, is wrestling with the degree to which insights from cross-cultural dialogue ought to inform dogmatic theology. He admires Webster’s work but wonders whether it pulls theology out of the orbit of particular human cultures, with the unintended consequence of devaluing non-Western theologies as deviations from the Latin (i.e., Western) norm.</p>
<p id="pz30-8">The way forward is to view concepts as mental habits that are not language specific. The “habit” in question is the association of ideas. Children learn to associate certain ideas with the concept “Christmas,” for example, by participating in annual family celebrations. Christians, similarly, learn the concepts that order faith by participating in celebrations of the Lord’s Supper and other worship practices and, more fundamentally, by reading Scripture and participating in what I have elsewhere called “canonical practices.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_29" id="ttf_07_29">29</a></sup> Doctrinal concepts thus function as shorthand for a whole set of associations (N. T. Wright compares them to suitcases). For example, think of how the doctrine of the atonement functions as shorthand for the much longer story of how God makes provision for the forgiveness of sins. As to the question of whether concepts are too tied to particular cultures, dogmatic theologians do well to remember that the same biblical judgments about who God is and what God is doing may be expressed in every language, sometimes with different concepts.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_30" id="ttf_07_30">30</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz30-9">A more fundamental question about concepts concerns the confidence with which dogmatic discourse can really speak of God’s own perfect life. Modern theologians typically stumble over Kantian limits, acutely conscious that the categories with which we think about the world tell us more about <span id="z31-6">the structures of human consciousness than they do the thing-in-itself: “To tour a town with a guidebook in hand is to see only what the guidebook permits.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_31" id="ttf_07_31">31</a></sup> If the thing-in-itself is always conceptually out of reach, how much more elusive is God-in-himself?</span></p>
<p id="pz31-7">Forms of experience and thought are obviously relevant to thinking infinity and knowing God and are thus elements in dogmatic discourse. Yet it is language that brokers the relationships between experience and thought, and language that is used to make dogmatic statements. So it comes as some surprise to discover that theologians typically do not pause to consider the role of language in dogmatics. Because human persons are embodied communicative agents, however, we should not draw too rigid a distinction between language, life, and thought. Accordingly, the “analytics” and “poetics” of my title roughly parallel the two views of language that Charles Taylor labels “designative” and “constitutive” in his book <i>The Language Animal</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_32" id="ttf_07_32">32</a></sup> The basic difference is between viewing language as a tool that subjects use to encode information, express thought, and represent things on the one hand, and as a medium of intersubjectivity, an enabling condition that makes certain kinds of experience and thought possible, on the other.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz31-9">John Webster frequently sounds a distinctly analytic note: “Dogmatics is the schematic and analytic presentation of the matter of the gospel.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_33" id="ttf_07_33">33</a></sup> It is a species of reasoning, and one of his signal contributions is his dogmatic account of such reasoning. It involves viewing reason as created and redeemed intelligence caught up in an economy of grace that enables the saints to understand God’s communicative acts. Whereas exegetical reasoning focuses on understanding the way the biblical words go, dogmatic reasoning yields “a conceptual representation of what reason has learned from its exegetical following of the scriptural text.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_34" id="ttf_07_34">34</a></sup> Is Websterian dogmatics therefore simply a species of analytic theology? Let’s analyze that proposition.</p>
<h3 id="pz32-6"><i>D<span class="smallcaps" id="AW-s6">OGMATIC</span> D<span class="smallcaps" id="A1pD">ISCOURSE AS</span> A<span class="smallcaps" id="AMoR">NALYTIC</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz32-7">The “retrieval” of analytic philosophy for the purposes of constructive theology is one of the major developments of our time, boasting annual conferences, a manifesto, and an online journal.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_35" id="ttf_07_35">35</a></sup> To what extent does it serve the task of dogmatics? More pointedly, to what extent is dogmatic discourse essentially analytic?</p>
<p id="pz32-8">William Abraham defines analytic theology as “systematic theology attuned to the deployment of the skills, resources, and virtues of analytic philosophy.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_36" id="ttf_07_36">36</a></sup> It is a method, says Oliver Crisp, “characterized by a logical rigour, clarity, and parsimony of expression.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_37" id="ttf_07_37">37</a></sup> Tom McCall’s recent book, <i>Invitation to Analytic Theology</i>, goes a long way towards showing how analytic theology is both analytic and theological. He also calls analytic theology “to a deeper engagement with the traditional resources of the theological task,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_38" id="ttf_07_38">38</a></sup> the very aim of Webster’s dogmatics.</p>
<p id="pz32-9">Webster clearly makes use of conceptual distinctions. Perhaps the most important is that between creature and Creator: “Dogmatics considers God absolutely and relatively,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_39" id="ttf_07_39">39</a></sup> that is, in his self-existent internal perfection and economically in his external works. The external works of God are <i>his</i> works, “and this continuity of acting subject means that God’s economic acts elucidate his inner being, even though they do not exhaust it.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_40" id="ttf_07_40">40</a></sup> Dogmatics begins by contemplating God’s external works, then traces them back to their worker, the undivided Trinity. To stay on the level of the economy only risks treating God and created things as paired, thus forgetting the all-important creature/Creator distinction. Webster insists that theology proper “is oriented chiefly to invisible things, ‘things that are unseen’ (2 Cor. 4:18).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_41" id="ttf_07_41">41</a></sup> But not necessarily <i>unheard</i>. Indeed, dogmatic theology speaks of these unseen things precisely by attending to what is spoken in Scripture, offering a conceptual analysis and elaboration of biblical discourse.</p>
<h3 id="pz33-6"><i>D<span class="smallcaps" id="AYC6">OGMATIC</span> D<span class="smallcaps" id="AryS">ISCOURSES AS</span> P<span class="smallcaps" id="AyeI">HENOMENOLOGICAL</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="AvJM">One underappreciated influence on analytic philosophy is phenomenology.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_42" id="ttf_07_42">42</a></sup> Phenomenology is a descriptive discipline that brackets out what we think we know about things, observes closely how they appear to consciousness, and then abstracts essences from the appearances. Edmund Husserl’s famous battle-cry—“back to the ‘things themselves’ ”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_43" id="ttf_07_43">43</a></sup>—sums up phenomenology’s descriptive aim. His famous eidetic reduction attempts to identify the essential components of phenomena by eliminating contingent aspects of things in order to imagine “the invariant, the necessary, universal form, the essential form, without which something of that kind . . . would be altogether inconceivable,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_44" id="ttf_07_44">44</a></sup> thereby identifying the absolute in the relative.</p>
<p id="pz33-7">Whereas phenomenology describes the essences of things that appear in consciousness, dogmatics describes the essences of things that happen in space-time, namely, the history of redemption attested by the biblical authors. Webster is a phenomenologist of the triune economy, concerned with describing not simply the phenomena—God’s space-time appearances—but his eternal essence as well. Webster’s aim is not the thing-in-itself but God-in-himself and all things-in-relation-to-God. Webster sounds like a phenomenologist when he speaks of dogmatic theology as a “reduction of elements to their founding principles.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_45" id="ttf_07_45">45</a></sup> By “principles” Webster means the beginning of things (from the Latin <i>principium</i> for “beginning, foundation”), referring to their origin and nature as creatures in relation to God. The ultimate origin and end of all things is the triune God, which is why Webster insists, “There is one principal Christian doctrine, the doctrine of God the Holy Trinity.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_46" id="ttf_07_46">46</a></sup> To give a dogmatic account of something is thus to locate the origin, nature, and end of that entity in relation to the triune God. The foundational principle of Christian dogmatics is the communicative being and activity of the triune God: “The principles of theology are thus a conceptual rendering of the work of divine charity, in which at the Son’s behest the Father sends the Spirit to instruct the church (John 14:26).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_47" id="ttf_07_47">47</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz34-6">Dogmatics is the result of created intelligence contemplating, reflecting on, and describing the economy of God’s self-communication: “Contemplation—what Aquinas calls ‘a simple gaze’—requires the mind to move through created things to the divine reality of whose self-communication they are signs and bearers.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_48" id="ttf_07_48">48</a></sup> This is similar to the eidetic reduction, a movement of thought from the economy (e.g., the missions) to the Trinitarian things themselves (e.g., the processions). As the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> puts it: “Through the <i>oikonomia</i> the <i>theologia</i> is revealed to us; but conversely, the <i>theologia</i> illuminates the whole <i>oikonomia</i>. God’s works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_49" id="ttf_07_49">49</a></sup> Again, Webster insists that dogmatics is possible only because the exercise of theological intelligence is “a moved movement”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_50" id="ttf_07_50">50</a></sup>: our intellectual capacities themselves have their origin in God, and it is God who sustains them and determines their proper ends.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_51" id="ttf_07_51">51</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz34-7">The proximate object of dogmatic contemplation, reflection, and description is Holy Scripture, whose verbal testimony is itself an element in the economies of revelation and redemption. Interestingly, the philosopher J. L. Austin likened his analytic approach to a phenomenology of ordinary language:</p> 
<blockquote id="pz34-8"><p class="blo">When we examine what we should say when, what words we should use in what situations, we are looking again not merely at words . . . but also at the realities we use the words to talk about. . . . For this reason, I think it might be better to use, for this way of doing philosophy, some less misunderstanding name than those given above—for instance, “linguistic phenomenology,” only that is rather a mouthful.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_52" id="ttf_07_52">52</a></sup></p> </blockquote>
<p class="noind" id="pz34-9">We can similarly describe Webster’s dogmatic discourse as a linguistic phenomenology, not of ordinary but biblical language, a description and contemplation of God’s Word written by the regenerated and illumined intellect. Biblical reasoning gives way to dogmatic reasoning, namely, a phenomenological description of the economic Trinity, whose “principle” or essence is God’s own perfect life in himself.</p>
<h3 id="pz35-6"><i>C<span class="smallcaps" id="A_Ae">AUTIONS</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="pz35-7">Is analysis—be it propositional, principial, or phenomenological—thus the primary mode of dogmatic discourse? Is the mission of dogmatic statements to achieve conceptual clarity and precision only? Several people warn against reducing dogmatics to analytics, including Webster himself.</p>
<p id="pz35-8">Khaled Anatolios, thinking of fourth-century Trinitarian controversies, argues that the church’s doctrine arises not merely from abstract logic applied to Scripture, but from Scripture as lived out in “the entirety of Christian faith and life,” including the liturgy, prayer, the moral life, and so forth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_53" id="ttf_07_53">53</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz35-9">T. F. Torrance, thinking of the gospel, says that “the ultimate mystery of the atonement recedes into the eternal being of God far beyond our human grasp.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_54" id="ttf_07_54">54</a></sup> This kind of conclusion “is often found in his writing when he becomes aware that our forms of thought and speech break off in wonder, as he refuses to advance along the path laid out by logico-causal attempts at explanation” (i.e., analytic theology!).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_55" id="ttf_07_55">55</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz35-10">John Webster’s caution appears in his essay “Principles of Systematic Theology,” in connection with his discussion of Geerhardus Vos’s distinction between biblical and systematic theology. According to Vos, biblical theology considers “both the form and the contours of revelation as . . . parts and products of a divine work. In Systematic Theology these same contents of revelation appear . . . rather as the material for a human work of classifying and systematizing according to logical principles.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_56" id="ttf_07_56">56</a></sup> Webster says this division of labor generates two problems. First, it turns the biblical texts into raw material for systematic processing, leaving the canonical form to be studied by another discipline (viz., biblical theology). Hence, “The idiom of systematic theology drifts away from Scripture. . . . Indeed, systematic theology becomes a kind of analytic theology, operating at some distance from the idiom of Scripture and heavily conceptual in tone and structure.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_57" id="ttf_07_57">57</a></sup> Second, it gives rise to the dangerous idea “of dogma as an improvement upon Holy Scripture—as the replacement of the informal and <span id="z36-6">occasional language of Scripture by conceptual forms at once more clearly organized, better warranted and betraying a greater degree of sophistication.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_58" id="ttf_07_58">58</a></sup> Webster prefers a kinder, gentler, more “lightweight” understanding of the dogmatic task—and, we might add, one that is more nimble when it comes to forms of discourse.</span></p>
<p id="pz36-7">Taylor’s concern with the designative view of discourse assumed by analytic philosophy and theology is that it views language as purely instrumental: a matter of encoding what is already known.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_59" id="ttf_07_59">59</a></sup> In other words, language comes too late to contribute anything to the discussion; it simply expresses what thought has already discovered. For Taylor, however, language is not merely a matter of words, labels, and conceptual tools that we acquire one at a time; it is rather something we learn in relation to learning forms of life. Stated differently: it is not as though we first relate to and analyze things and then say what we have discovered; it is rather that certain forms of language enable certain kinds of experience and thought.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_60" id="ttf_07_60">60</a></sup></p>

<p class="noind" id="pz36-9">This brings us to the poetics of dogmatics, by which I mean a concern not only for <i>what</i> is said, but also <i>how</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_61" id="ttf_07_61">61</a></sup> The task of dogmatics involves content, to be sure, but also the forms of language, experience, and thought that communicate it. Webster tends to use the term “poetics” pejoratively, as a catchall term for approaches that put too much emphasis on human creativity and invention.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_62" id="ttf_07_62">62</a></sup> Yet he also says positive things about what I mean by poetics, namely, the relationship of forms of language and literature to forms of experience and thought. For example, he acknowledges the importance of Scripture’s own forms of discourse: “Scripture is doing real work, not simply furnishing topics to be handled in a non-Scriptural idiom.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_63" id="ttf_07_63">63</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz36-10">Webster manifests a concern for what I am calling poetics when he <span id="z37-6">says that the history of the various genres of theological writing “is still largely unexplored in any systematic way; yet the importance of such a study for interpreting the situation of theology in modernity can scarcely be over-emphasized.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_64" id="ttf_07_64">64</a></sup> What happens to dogmatics, he wonders, when <i>Wissenschaft</i> replaces biblical commentary? David Tracy describes modern theology as the triumph of <i>logos</i> (by which he means propositions and the conceptual form) over <i>theos</i> and the various ways in which Scripture names God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_65" id="ttf_07_65">65</a></sup> The contrast with the earlier modes of dogmatic discourse Webster wants to retrieve is striking: “When citation is in the ascendant, the literary forms of theology are generally governed by the fact that the Christian worlds of meaning are shaped by biblical, creedal and doxological texts and by the practices which both carry and are themselves carried by those texts.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_66" id="ttf_07_66">66</a></sup> Webster never comes closer to a call for a properly Protestant poetics than that.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_67" id="ttf_07_67">67</a></sup></span></p> <br/>

<p class="noind" id="pz37-9">This is not the place to respond to Webster’s call to explore the history of genres of theological writing. I have time merely to list a few examples.</p> 
<p class="h5" id="pz37-10"><i>Gregory of Nazianzus’s Poemata Arcama</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="pz37-11">You know Gregory, “the Theologian,” one of the Cappadocians, a bishop, and chairman of the Council in 381 that produced the Nicene Creed. But did you know that he was also a poet?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_68" id="ttf_07_68">68</a></sup> According to Frederick Norris, “The poems present Christian claims in Hellenistic verses at the same time that they specifically avoid the elegant buffoonery of classical rhetoric—cute words without content—that Gregory so despised. They provide simple, appealing aspects of Christian confession that meet the needs of common people”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_69" id="ttf_07_69">69</a></sup> or, to use the title of Norris’s essay, a poetic, musical catechism.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_70" id="ttf_07_70">70</a></sup></p> 
<p class="h5" id="pz38-6"><i>Friedrich Schleiermacher’s Christmas Eve Celebration: A Dialogue</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="Alvc">Schleiermacher is “the only major theologian to produce a distinctive book on Christmas for the general public.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_71" id="ttf_07_71">71</a></sup> It’s similar to a Platonic dialogue, but with women and children. Schleiermacher sets his dramatic dialogue showcasing different perspectives on the incarnation in an ordinary German household on Christmas Eve. Of particular interest is the way the four men tend to give academic interpretations while the women tell stories. There is singing and an exchange of gifts as well. This is a fascinating example of theological communication that allows Schleiermacher to make his point indirectly about the commingling of love and joy. The style matches the substance, for the way in which Schleiermacher shows the competing voices amiably engaging one another speaks volumes about what he takes to be the meaning of Christmas itself.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_72" id="ttf_07_72">72</a></sup></p> 
<p class="h5" id="pz38-7"><i>Hans Urs von Balthasar’s Theo-Drama</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="pz38-8">Hans Urs von Balthasar represents what is probably the most impressive twentieth-century attempt to explore the poetics of dogmatics. He unfolds God’s revelatory Word in terms of Plato’s transcendentals—the true, good, and beautiful—over a dozen volumes in three series: “Balthasar insisted that there can be no reflection on the <i>truth</i> of Christian revelation (Part 3) until it is lived out in committed <i>action</i> (Part 2), which a Christian will never feel called to do without having first perceived revelation in all its inherent <i>beauty</i> (Part 1).”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_73" id="ttf_07_73">73</a></sup> Interestingly, Balthasar begins with the perception of beauty in his seven volume <i>Glory of the Lord: A Theological Aesthetics</i> where the incarnate “form” of divine self-communication, Jesus Christ, takes pride of place.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_74" id="ttf_07_74">74</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz38-9">In <i>Theo-Drama</i>, Balthasar focuses on God’s saving action in Christ under the rubric of the “good” (as in good news).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_75" id="ttf_07_75">75</a></sup> Here God’s self-communication takes dramatic form in the form of a servant, the lived humanity of Jesus—the drama of the Christ.</p>
<p id="pz38-10">I have suggested in my own work that if the method of Christian dog<span id="z39-6">matics is to correspond to its subject matter, then it ought to take the form of a theodramatics. This is my way of doing justice to the full scope of dogmatics, insofar as the discipline, in Webster’s words, “requires consideration of both <i>credenda</i> and agenda.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_76" id="ttf_07_76">76</a></sup> The gospel is not an idea but a communicative activity, a divine word and deed, spoken and enacted on the stage of world history. To provide a “schematic and analytical presentation of the matter of the gospel”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_77" id="ttf_07_77">77</a></sup> is thus to explain the agent and the action at the heart of the drama of redemption: “conceived . . . born . . . suffered . . . was crucified, died, buried . . . rose again . . . ascended . . . will come again.” The dogmatic exposition of those crucial verbs helps disciples understand what God is doing in Christ, and then to demonstrate their understanding by living out its truth. The etymology of the Greek term <i>dogma</i> connotes “what seems good, fitting, becoming,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_78" id="ttf_07_78">78</a></sup> and I have argued that the task of dogmatics is to instruct the church in theodramatic fittingness.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_79" id="ttf_07_79">79</a></sup> To speak and show faith’s understanding—this too is high historical drama, and as Dorothy Sayers says, “the dogma is the drama.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_80" id="ttf_07_80">80</a></sup> Dogmatics directs disciples to show and tell the greatest story ever told.</span></p>
<p id="pz39-7">I got Webster’s endorsement on the back of a book, but what he gave with a right-hand blurb, he partially took back with a left-hand footnote: “I remain agnostic about whether the task of theological identity description of moral agents is helped by a ‘theodramatic’ conception of the Christian faith.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_81" id="ttf_07_81">81</a></sup> I wish I had had the opportunity to convert him from agnosticism into whole-hearted belief, perhaps by arguing that theodrama is a “form of forms” that allows us to coordinate the form of Jesus Christ with the various literary forms of Scripture that attest him, and which generate and govern forms of Christian experience, thinking, and practice.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz39-10">Let’s return to Webster’s exhortation not to let systematic theology drift away from the idioms of Scripture so that its mode of argument is exclusively logical analysis.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_82" id="ttf_07_82">82</a></sup> Scripture is doing “real work,” he says, real argumentative work. Elsewhere I have argued that the imagination too is a cognitive <span id="z40-6">capacity, something God creates, regenerates, and redeems along with the creaturely intellect.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_83" id="ttf_07_83">83</a></sup> It is important to hearken to the several ways Scripture says what is in Christ.</span></p> 
<p class="h5" id="pz40-7"><i>The Biblical Imagination: Enlarging the Domain of the Word</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="Au0F">Combining Webster’s concern for the idioms of Scripture with Charles Taylor’s conviction that language creates a context for human life and action yields a greater appreciation of the theologically formative biblical imagination, and ultimately an enlargement of the domain of the Word.</p>
<p id="pz40-8">As we have seen, the analytic impulse is to break things up into their component parts and the phenomenological impulse is to reduce things to their essential principles. In both cases, the aim is to describe a certain objective content with concepts that are as clear as they are clean. There is no question that dogmatics aspires to be “the <i>scientia</i> of what faith knows.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_84" id="ttf_07_84">84</a></sup> The question is whether dogmatic discourse does more than simply encode information and designate things.</p>
<p id="pz40-9">The nature of Scripture, and hence biblical authority, is a matter of form as well as content. God in his wisdom saw fit to employ many forms of human discourse to communicate his Word. Take narrative, for example: stories are not simply delivery systems for transmitting factual content but cognitive strategies in their own right that help us organize events in orderly patterns and meaningful wholes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_85" id="ttf_07_85">85</a></sup> This is the distinct poetics of biblical narrative, its particular way of handling the part/whole relationship: explanation by emplotment. To invoke poetics, then, is to call attention not simply to bits of revealed information (content) but to larger-scale patterns of information processing (form).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_86" id="ttf_07_86">86</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz40-10">Martha Nussbaum says we need poets and novelists because “in today’s political life we lack the capacity to see one another as fully human.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_87" id="ttf_07_87">87</a></sup> How much more do we need biblical narrative to see Jesus Christ as fully human and fully divine, and to cultivate not simply right opinion but right <span id="z41-6">affections: the fear of the Lord. The demons believe, but their hearts have not been formed to respond to the truth in the right way. It is one thing to assent to propositions, quite another to confess and live them out. The imagination at work in the various forms of biblical literature addresses the heart as well as the intellect. The illumination of the Spirit turns the forms of biblical discourse into means of grace which not only inform but reform human cognition, volition, and affection alike. The Bible makes possible the common focus of the gathered assembly on the gospel. The Bible exercises a constitutive function as canon, gathering and governing the people of God, which is why the Reformers treat the church as a creature of the Word.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_88" id="ttf_07_88">88</a></sup></span></p> 
<p class="h5" id="pz41-7"><i>The Christian Imaginary: From Biblical Forms to Dogmatic Formulations</i></p>
<p class="noind" id="pz41-8">Much more could be said about the poetics of biblical discourse, but what is the moral for dogmatics? It is one thing to acknowledge the cognitive function of narrative, another thing to adopt its form. Should dogmatic theology look more like a science textbook, a system of ideas, or a story? Three brief points:</p>
<p id="pz41-9">First, we must not confuse propositional content with propositional form. All discourse is propositional insofar as it has content (subject and predicate). Poetics calls attention to the diverse ways that various forms of discourse propose some content for our consideration. Some forms of discourse (call them analytic) excel in clarifying what it is we’re talking about by breaking it down into its smallest components; others (call them imaginative) excel in helping us view things synthetically, as parts of a larger whole that provides meaning (remember Ramanujan, the “Prince of Intuition”). Both modes are broadly propositional.</p>
<p id="pz41-10">Second, let’s not commit the “fallacy of imitative form,” namely, the mistake of thinking that dogmatics has to adopt the actual styles of biblical discourse in order to think biblically. You can talk about Plato’s dialogues monologically, just as you can talk about narrative without having to tell a story.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_89" id="ttf_07_89">89</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz42-6">And third, the rationality of arguments is not always a matter of deductive validity or logical inference. The narrative form of the Fourth Gospel is a kind of courtroom drama where readers are presented with various kinds of evidence or testimony in word and deed: “But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:31). To do justice to this kind of biblical discourse, we require both analytic skills and poetic sensibilities: the ability <i>conceptually to elaborate</i> what is said and the ability <i>imaginatively to feel</i> the particular force with which it is said. Even the demons can do analytic theology.</p>
<p id="pz42-7">Colin Gunton, in his essay “Dogma, the Church, and the Task of Theology,” cites Isidore of Seville, “the last Western church father,” who says that dogma means “I judge this to be good, this to be true” (and we could add, “this to be beautiful”).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_90" id="ttf_07_90">90</a></sup> Dogmatic discourse articulates what the church judges to be true, good, and beautiful on the basis of the Scriptures. In particular, says Gunton, “the function of dogma is the articulation of the whole,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_91" id="ttf_07_91">91</a></sup> namely, God’s plan to unite all things in Christ (Eph 1:10). Whereas analytic theology concerns clarifying “the parts,” what I am calling poetics treats the ways dogmas articulate “the whole.”</p>
<p id="pz42-8">Dogmas are ecclesial judgments about who God is and what God has done, is now doing, and will do in Christ, based on the observation and contemplation of the form and content of biblical discourse. They are judgments that discern the truth, goodness, and beauty of the unified plot of redemptive history and triune identity of the Redeemer. The “whole” that dogmas articulate is the gospel of God and the God of the gospel. Dogmas are “summaries of gospel material,”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_92" id="ttf_07_92">92</a></sup> identifications of the actors and précis of the plot expressed in the economy of salvation, an economy that communicates in time the way God is in eternity.</p>
<p id="pz42-9">Gerhard Sauter says that dogmas “are statements to which we can and must refer because they express linguistically the valid and provisionally enduring content of theological knowledge.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_93" id="ttf_07_93">93</a></sup> Dogmatic discourse characteristically refers everything back to the gospel of God and the God of the gospel. The life and work of the triune God constitute the framework, <span id="z43-6"><i>principium</i>, and whole under which everything else is to be understood. To give a dogmatic account of something, therefore, is ultimately to relate that thing to its origin in creation through Christ and to the redemptive plan of the Father enacted in the Son by the Spirit.</span></p>
<p id="pz43-7">This drama of redemption—the action and its divine players—serves as what we might call, with a nod to Charles Taylor, the Christian social imaginary, that prereflective “doxa” or inherited opinion that theologians inhabit before they examine critically. The Christian imaginary is the biblically normed imaginary of the church, the society of Jesus Christ. It is this storied understanding that frames the church’s most important convictions and shapes its most important practices.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_94" id="ttf_07_94">94</a></sup> Dogmatics proves itself in its service to the gospel of Jesus Christ: preserving the integrity of the story, expositing what gives unity to the story, and in general giving direction for understanding, seeing, tasting, and judging everything that is in relation to the drama of redemption and its principal agent, the triune God.</p>

<p class="noind" id="pz43-9">It is out of this Christian imaginary, sourced and normed by the Scriptures, that the church produces dogmatic statements—what Webster calls “astonished indications.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_95" id="ttf_07_95">95</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pz43-10"><i>D<span class="smallcaps" id="A9Ku">OGMATIC</span> I<span class="smallcaps" id="Agsp">NDICATIVES</span>: S<span class="smallcaps" id="Auqz">TATEMENTS ON A</span> M<span class="smallcaps" id="AVf1">ISSION</span></i></h3>
<p class="noind" id="AmMd">Dogmatic statements are statements on a mission, namely, to state what is happening in the missions of the Son and the Spirit. The risen Jesus assures his disciples that they will receive “power” when the Holy Spirit comes upon them. He also says they will be his witnesses in Jerusalem and to all the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). The two points are linked: the Spirit enables true witness. We can go further: the Holy Spirit enlists dogmatic statements in his own mission to bear witness to the mission of the Son. How else should we construe Nicene Trinitarianism?</p>
<p id="pz43-11">To bear witness is to confess what one has seen, heard, and believed to be true. Paul says that Timothy “made the good [<i>kalēn</i>, “wise” or “beautiful”] <span id="z44-6">confession in the presence of many witnesses” (1 Tim 6:12), and did so in imitation of Christ, “who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession” (1 Tim 6:13). The witness is a martyr: one whose life is often at stake because of one’s confession. Dogmatic theology is instruction in bearing right witness to the God of the gospel—call it orthomartyrology: to say of what is in Christ that it is.</span></p>
<p id="pz44-7">For Barth, no topic in dogmatics ever really gets beyond the “utterly minimal” statement, “God is.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_96" id="ttf_07_96">96</a></sup> Yet <i>is</i> can be said in many ways. There is a poetics of testimony.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_97" id="ttf_07_97">97</a></sup> Consider: the metaphorical is (“is and is not”); the narrative is (“now is, and then is”); the eschatological is (“is already and is not yet”); and, finally, the eternal is (“is now and ever shall be”). The point is that dogmatics guides the church in saying what is in Christ.</p>
<p id="pz44-8">Jesus Christ is the first and foremost witness. He is alive, and his presence is communicative. It was he who commissioned John’s testimony in the book of Revelation: “I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, ‘Write what you see in a book’ ” (Rev 1:12). Everything in Scripture is testimony commissioned by the risen Christ. Dogmatic theology is the church’s verbal testimony to the verbal testimony of the prophets and apostles to Jesus Christ. Dogmatic theologians are part not only of a cloud but also a chain of witnesses commissioned to teach the truth of Jesus Christ. A dogmatic statement says what is in Jesus Christ, and it does so only because the church has heard what Christ says about himself in the Scriptures. Demonic discourse may be indicative, technically correct, and perhaps even astonished, but it cannot be joyful, faithful, and adoring, as is dogmatic discourse. Clarity on this point allows us to specify the dogmatic location of Christian dogmatics: it is a part of the economy of light by which the risen Son distributes truth through word and Spirit.</p>

<p class="noind" id="AFk1">One particular beam of light shines through in Acts 15, the episode of the Jerusalem Council. It all started with some men from Judea saying that salvation required circumcision. You see, the circumcision party failed to understand the drama of redemption. They were stuck in “act 2,” apparently unaware that the cross did away with the wall of hostility that divided Jew <span id="z45-6">and Gentile. What was at stake at the Jerusalem Council was nothing less than the integrity of the gospel, and how rightly to represent the God of the gospel by living out its implications.</span></p>
<p id="pz45-7">After much debate (Acts 15:7), Peter testified to a game-changing divine deed: God gave believing Gentiles the Holy Spirit (Acts 15:8). Barnabas and Paul corroborate Peter’s story (Acts 15:12). James then cites Amos 9:11–12 and pronounces his judgment: “we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God” (Acts 15:19). Luke says, “It seemed good to the apostles” (Acts 15:22, 25) and “to the Holy Spirit” (Acts 15:28). Recall that <i>dogmas</i> pertain to judgments that something is or is not true, good, and beautiful. Luke uses the term in Acts 16:4 when he mentions “the decisions [<i>ta dogmata</i>] that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.” The Jerusalem Council produced a judgment about what God was doing in Christ. As a result, they were able to agree that requiring circumcision of believing Gentiles lacked fittingness with the drama of redemption. This corporate judgment marks the genesis of dogmatics.</p>
<p id="pz45-8">The mission of dogmatic statements is to understand the mission of God and, by implication, the mission of the church. The church’s mission is to confess the truth of Jesus Christ. “Confession,” says Webster, “. . . is that event in which the speech of the church is arrested, grasped, and transfigured by the self-giving presence of God.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_98" id="ttf_07_98">98</a></sup> Confession is responsive rather than spontaneous; it’s an episode in the conflict whereby God overcomes sin, in particular the demonic tendency to say it like you don’t mean it. The demons can only acknowledge Jesus as the Son of God, not confess him as Lord: “Without personal identification with Jesus Christ, cognitive specification of who he is remains empty; without cognitive specification of who Jesus Christ is, however, personal identification with him is blind.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_99" id="ttf_07_99">99</a></sup> When the church confesses, it does not simply designate things, it inhabits the language of faith: “it does not convert the drama of redemption into a set of propositions to be policed.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_100" id="ttf_07_100">100</a></sup> To confess is to participate rightly in the economy of testimony. To confess is joyfully to acknowledge Jesus as Lord (cf. Rom 10:9).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_101" id="ttf_07_101">101</a></sup> The demons believe; they cannot confess.</p>

<p class="noind" id="AGbE">Why is there dogmatics rather than nothing? The short answer: to point to what God is doing in Christ and direct disciples to do the same. Barth was impressed by the quasi-miraculous way that Grünewald’s Isenheim altarpiece depicts John the Baptist’s finger pointing to Jesus. It’s also a metaphor for my final point, about the importance of including gestures in dogmatic discourse. Saying what is in Christ involves a certain kind of body language too, namely, action on the part of the body of Christ, the church. This too is part of the poetics of dogmatic discourse. Indeed, the characteristic gesture of Protestant dogmatics is not a fist raised in protest but a finger—or rather, a whole body—that indicates Jesus Christ.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_102" id="ttf_07_102">102</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz46-7">Certain ways of being together would not be possible without language. Without language, says Charles Taylor, humans would lack the crucial capacity “for joint attention, or communion.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_103" id="ttf_07_103">103</a></sup> If this is the case in general, how much more is it the case in that bodily gathering we call the church. Dogmatic discourse does not simply refer to things; it makes possible “a shared consciousness of the world.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_104" id="ttf_07_104">104</a></sup> Specifically, dogmatic discourse enables the church’s joint attention on God, the communion of the saints, the coordinated action of Christian witness, and a common confession. Learning the language (dogmatics) is inseparable from learning the life (discipleship).</p>
<p id="pz46-8">Dogmatics takes not a village but a body: the church. Recent work in linguistics suggests that gestures—bodily movements that are not mere expressions of experience but communicative actions in their own right—are vital ingredients in both speaking and thinking.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_105" id="ttf_07_105">105</a></sup> Gestures do not simply express thought or language but are part of language.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_106" id="ttf_07_106">106</a></sup> Just as forms of language become intelligible in the context of forms of life, so also gestures disambiguate speech (and vice versa): “Speech acts involve more than emitting the appropriate words. They also involve bodily action, stance, gesture.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_107" id="ttf_07_107">107</a></sup> This should not be entirely foreign to those who confess the <span id="z47-6">Word made flesh (John 1:14). The astonished indications that comprise the poetics of dogmatic discourse involve concepts (propositions) and body-language (practices) alike.</span></p>
<p id="pz47-7">In 2 Corinthians 9:13, Paul links the Corinthians glorifying God both to their confession of the gospel and to their generosity in contributing to a gift for the Jerusalem church. This concrete gesture helped the early church express what it meant to be one body. Another characteristic gesture is genuflection, by which a worshiper embodies submission to God by bowing. Hugh of St. Victor wrote a whole book on the pedagogy of gestures, which he defined as a movement of the whole body.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_108" id="ttf_07_108">108</a></sup> For Hugh, gestures speak, and speech is expressive. Dogmatics is as much about learning to imitate God’s gestures after him as it is thinking God’s thoughts after him.</p>
<p id="pz47-8">Dogmatic discourse orients the church’s corporate witness and gives guidance to the speech and gestures of the body of Christ. What we do with our bodies in the body of Christ is part and parcel of our Christian witness. To be a disciple is, in part, to have one’s embodied experience transformed to show forth Christ’s body.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_109" id="ttf_07_109">109</a></sup> Dogmatics helps the church make “Christly gestures.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_110" id="ttf_07_110">110</a></sup></p>
<p id="pz47-9">One particular Christly gesture, replete with theological significance, is the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, an enacted summa of the gospel.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_111" id="ttf_07_111">111</a></sup> In sharing the loaf, the church performs its union and communion in Christ. I won’t here get into what kind of <i>is</i> Jesus had in mind in saying, “This is my body.” Suffice it to say that a dogmatic account of the Lord’s Supper enables disciples to discern the body (1 Cor 11:29), and in so discerning, to become the body: an instantiation of dogmatic discourse and compelling gesture of dogmatic truth.</p>
<p id="pz47-10">In conclusion, dogmatics is the cognitive science or mind of the body of Christ, and exists to build up and help form the church into a holy nation: the city of God. Just as the medieval cathedral was a <i>summa theologia</i> that witnessed in the form of stone and glass to the invisible things above, so the forms of experience, thought, and language of the people of <span id="z48-1">God constitute a temple made of living stones (1 Pet 2:5), a living <i>summa theologia</i>. Dogmatics aims to re-form minds and hearts, language and lives in order better to conform them to the form of Jesus Christ, the <i>logos</i> of God.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_112" id="ttf_07_112">112</a></sup> Forms of biblical discourse and interpretation give rise to forms of right dogmatic thinking and speaking which in turn give rise to right forms of Christian worship and living: “Christly gestures.” Dogmatics is a conceptual gesture set forth in speech: an adoring indication of the truth, goodness, and beauty of what is in Christ, and thus a grammatical rule for the body-language of the body of Christ as it seeks to show and tell the glories of the Lord.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#ftt_07_113" id="ttf_07_113">113</a></sup></span></p>
