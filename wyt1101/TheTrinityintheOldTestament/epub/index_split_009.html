<p class="calibre1">This article explores the influence of the doctrine of the Trinity on moral life. It explains that the elaboration of all teaching about the Trinity and moral life begins with what is taught about creation and divine exemplar causality. It describes moral life in terms of the creative Trinity and human participation, as the created image of God, in the eternal law—a participation that through grace becomes filial conformity to God the Trinity in truth and charity, whose glorious consummation is sketched in the beatitudes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, moral life, creation, causality, divine exemplar, human participation, God the Trinity <b class="calibre3">The Vestige and the Image of the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE elaboration of all teaching about the Trinity and the moral life begins with what is taught about creation and divine exemplar causality. Just as one discovers vestiges of the Trinity in all that exists, so traces of the Trinity appear in all that moves. While moral teaching concerns itself with what human persons do, the great authors of the Christian tradition recognized even in the movements of plants and animals certain signs that point toward the three-Person God, the Agent who made all creatures both great and small. The saints illustrate this intuition about the divine governance of the cosmos: for example, St Patrick's shamrock, which grows three leaves on one stem to display the sublime mystery of the Three in One, and St Martin de Porres's choir of mice, which the saint instructed to bow appropriately at the invocation of the Trinity. Throughout the Christian centuries however, theological commentary and reflection centre appropriately on the imprint of the Trinity on the free moral behaviour of human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the biblical witness and the received teaching, humans are created in the image of God— <i class="calibre4">ad imaginem Dei</i>. Since, in the Christian view of the moral life, the human person stands between God and God, all human conduct participates in what is called the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘image of creation’. This means that the very structure of the human soul reflects the ordering of the Persons within the Trinity. Human love follows human knowledge in the way Page 1 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p512"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinitarian Imprint on the Moral Life</b> that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (St Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.45, a.7,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.). The imprint of divine truth on all created motion leads theologians to speak of the Eternal Law, which establishes the pattern for the being and movement of all that exists. In rational creatures, the Eternal Law expresses itself as the natural moral law (Hittinger 2003). Because of the connotation  <i class="calibre4">logos</i> bears with norm, it is customary to associate this divinely ordered pattern for human behaviour  <b class="calibre3">(p. 488) </b>with the Second Divine Person, the Logos/Son. Like all things that exist outside of the Trinity however, the natural moral law itself bears the imprint of all three Divine Persons. The appropriation—to use the technical term—to the Second in God signals the practice of theologians to point out the affinity that human conduct is meant to enjoy with the ‘Wisdom of God’ (Wisd. 7:27), the divine  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>: ‘Filio autem appropriatur sapientia, per quam agens per intellectum operatur, et ideo dicitur de Filio, per quem omnia facta sunt’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.45, a.6, ad2). ‘To the Son is appropriated wisdom, through which the intellectual agent acts; and therefore it is said: “Through Whom all things were made” ’. In this place, Aquinas explains a familiar text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (Merriell 1990). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sound Christian doctrine not only ascribes to God a full exercise of the divine  <i class="calibre4">esse</i>, which is identical with the divine  <i class="calibre4">agere</i>, but also allows the human creature the full expression of created freedom all the while respecting the divine transcendence and God's claim on the human person. Within the context of the full revelation of the Blessed Trinity, the moral life finds its origin, flourishing, and fulfilment in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Were a theologian to opine otherwise, one would be left with a God who is not the first and transcendent cause of every being, act, and formal perfection. Such a conclusion stands at deep odds with all that the Christian Church holds and cherishes about the most adorable and blessed Trinity. Not a few modern theories of human liberty leave the human creature outside of any direct influence of the creating Trinity, and so construct an imaginary world of human autonomy that not only contradicts Christian revelation but also runs against the sound philosophical reflection that undergirds theological argument (Long 2002). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinitarian Pattern of Morality</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When Christ addresses God as ‘Father’, the Saviour announces a new and unexpected conformity with God (Matt. 6:9); we become sons and daughters in the Incarnate Son. It is axiomatic in Christian theology that grace causes in the soul this filial conformity to God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Hütter 2007). One classical authority for such standard Christian teaching is found in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> of Thomas Aquinas; for example, ‘anima per gratiam conformatur Deo’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.43, a.5, ad2). Since the soul is conformed to God by grace, this gift of divine grace both elevates and perfects human conduct so that what human beings do in accord with this gift readies them for the everlasting gift of perfect communion with the Blessed Trinity. The ‘image of grace’ is found in the person whom God has conformed to Himself. Within the actual order of God's providence, this conformity exists, as far as one knows from divine revelation, because and only because Page 2 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p513"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinitarian Imprint on the Moral Life</b> of the life-giving death of Jesus Christ and its sacramental mediation within the Church of faith and sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Christian tradition prefers to speak about the graced conformity of the human person to God as an indwelling of the Divine Persons in the souls of the just (Hill 1982). <b class="calibre3">(p. 489)</b> The metaphor of ‘indwelling’ derives from the many places in the New Testament where Jesus Christ promises his disciples to abide within them. For example: Judas, not the Iscariot, said to him, ‘Master, (then) what happened that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?’ Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him’. (Jn 14: 22–3)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lives of the saints best reveal the existential significance of the indwelling Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider the lesson taught to the French gentlewoman, Élisabeth Catez, who after her entrance into a French Carmelite monastery became known as Elizabeth of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One author recounts that</p>
<p class="calibre1">in February of 1900, the young aspirant to the Carmel of Dijon was introduced to a Dominican friar, a friend of the nuns. Elizabeth asked for help in understanding her interior experience—her need for silence and recollection, and her sense of an inexplicable presence in the depth of her soul. This Dominican proceeded to deepen her awareness of the truth of the indwelling of the Trinity in the soul of the baptized: that not just Christ, but that ‘all three of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Spirit—were present in love in her soul.’ This graced meeting greatly reassured Elizabeth and aided her in her spiritual progress. (Ross 2010) Blessed Elizabeth of the Trinity's spiritual writings provide a practical way for the inquiring believer to discover what is unique about the proper relations of the indwelling Persons that those conformed to God by grace enjoy. Another saintly woman, the fourteenth-century Dominican mystic and Doctor of the Church, Catherine of Siena, experienced this Trinitarian mystery in a particularly vivid way:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like two young ecclesiastics saying their office together, the Saviour and Catherine walked up and down the brick floor of the chapel, and with great diligence and unspeakable awe the young woman spoke the Latin words (hardly hearing them, because of the loud beating of her heart), and when, at the end of each psalm, she had to say the doxology: ‘Glory be to the Father and to the Son,’ etc., she altered the words and making a deep reverence towards the Lord, said in a trembling voice: ‘Glory be to the Father and to  <i class="calibre4">Thee</i> and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen’. (Jorgensen 1938: 56–7, original emphasis; Baldwin 1987: 32)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a particularly illuminating elucidation of the fourteenth chapter of St John's Gospel, Thomas Aquinas speaks about the divine indwelling in terms of the effects of the missions of the Divine Persons Who are sent: ‘Nam, sicut effectus missionis Filii fuit ducere ad Pa</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinitarian Imprint on the Moral Life</b> trem, ita effectus missionis Spiritus Sancti est ducere fideles ad Filium’ (Thomas Aquinas, <i class="calibre4">Lectura in Iohannis evangelium</i> 14:26; Marietti edition, no. 1958). ‘Just as the effect of the mission of the Son is to lead us to the Father, so also the effect of the mission of the Holy Spirit is to lead the faithful to the Son’ (trans. Author). It is commonplace to observe that the ordering of the missions of the divine person, which constitute, as it were, the temporal extension of the divine processions within the Trinity of Persons, is reversed when the work of leading the faithful to the Father unfolds. The two proces <b class="calibre3">(p. 490) </b>sions of knowledge (filiation) and love (spiration), which stand at the heart of disclosing as much as the human mind can embrace of the mystery of the Three in One, issue in the visible mission of the Son, which is the Incarnation, and the invisible mission of the Holy Spirit, which brings the gift of divine charity that constitutes the unique privilege of those whom God justifies. Drawing upon the Ninth Book of St Augustine's  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>, Aquinas penned the memorable expression  <i class="calibre4">Verbum spirans Amorem</i> to capture the originating work of divine charity that configures the soul to the Holy Spirit: ‘Filius autem est Verbum, non qualecumque, sed spirans Amorem’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.43, a.5, ad2). ‘Thus the Son is sent not in accordance with every and any kind of intellectual perfection, but according to the intellectual illumination, which breaks forth into the affection of love, as is said (Jn 6:45): </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone that hath heard from the Father and hath learned, cometh to Me,” and (Ps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">38:4): “In my meditation a fire shall flame forth” ’. And in another place, Aquinas further explains this foundational principle of the Christian moral life: ‘Filius ergo tradit nobis doctrinam, cum sit Verbum; sed Spiritus Sanctus doctrinae eius nos capaces facit’ ( <i class="calibre4">Lectura in Iohannis evangelium</i> 14:26; Marietti edition, no. 1958). ‘Since he is the Word, the Son hands over to us holy teaching; though the Holy Spirit makes us capable of observing his teaching’ (trans. Author). In short, Christian life unfolds as an exercise in truth, as an incarnation of  <i class="calibre4">caritas in veritate</i>, of love in truth—to borrow the title of Pope Benedict XVI's third encyclical. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Moral Conduct</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the earliest teachers of Christian morality set about to explain the gift of divine charity, they did not turn to esotericism. Because of the affinity that exists between the Trinitarian image of creation and the Trinitarian image of grace, the Christian tradition was not loathe to borrow categories of moral thought from classical sources that predated the birth of the Lord. Certain Church Fathers speculated whether Moses had influenced Plato, while others found Athens a rich source for describing the moral life that the inhabitants of the new Jerusalem were expected to follow. One of the best examples of the kind of ethical thinking that finds a home in the Church appears in the adoption of the four cardinal virtues to describe the human content of the moral life. Prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance provide so many hinges (in Latin,  <i class="calibre4">cardo</i>) on which the whole of the moral life turns (Pieper 1965). Theologians of genius have recognized that the moral order stipulated by the moral virtues receives a gratuitous elevation when the gift of divine grace imbues them with the three theological virtues, faith, hope, and charity. These virtues—sometimes called the theologal virtues to indicate that they flow from the godly life—represent the distinctive moral resources that God bestows on those whom he calls Page 4 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p515"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinitarian Imprint on the Moral Life</b> and justifies (Cessario 1996). Although there are differences of opinion about how the human and Christian virtues interact with each other, it remains common practice to distinguish between the acquired moral virtues and the infused moral and theological virtues (Cessario 2009). <b class="calibre3">(p. 491) </b>With the Trinitarian image of grace operative in human life, the moral agent enjoys the full and complete possession of these infused or Christian virtues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a breakdown of each of the seven virtues into its proper parts, no aspect of human or divine life is left without a properly theological, and therefore Trinitarian, account. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theologians generally recognize the  <i class="calibre4">secunda pars</i> of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> as one masterful presentation of the Christian life based on the seven virtues that accompany the divine indwelling. Aquinas and other Christian authors also discuss the vices that oppose each of the virtues. The overall work of the virtues that perfect the human person is easy to recapitulate: virtues perfect the operational capacities of the human person, whereas vicious defects leave the sinful person in a state of impairment and moral dissipation (Cessario 2002). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian theology envisages beatific vision or communion with the Persons of the Blessed Trinity as the term and perfection of human existence. In order to prepare the wayfarer for this transcendent enjoyment, additional gifts or resources are given to those who abide with Christ. Foremost among these are what the theological tradition refers to as the gifts of the Holy Spirit (Cessario 1991). While mentioned in the Old Testament as qualities proper to the Messiah, the earliest Christian theologians immediately grasped the logic of attributing these gifts to those who are incorporated into Christ through baptism. The Trinitarian formula used at baptism announces the start of the divine indwelling; this grace includes not only the infused virtues but also the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. They are traditionally called wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. Theologians have developed spiritual commentaries that relate these gifts to the seven virtues of the Christian life (Brennan 1966). The special feature of the gift of the Holy Spirit emerges within the Christian soul as a sort of spiritual instinct for pursuing divine things. The gifts attune the soul to the prompting of the Holy Spirit, who acts on the stage of life like a prompter in a theatrical production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through these instinctual gifts, the Christian experiences a special consolation inasmuch as he or she recognizes a felt fulfilment of Christ's promise that he will not leave his followers orphans. Rather, as Christ himself promises: ‘The Advocate, the holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name—he will teach you everything and remind you of all that (I) told you’ (Jn 14:26). The Christian moral tradition also incorporates the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit into a full account of the Trinitarian dimensions of the moral life. The list is developed from those qualities that St Paul mentions in Gal. 5:22–3 (Vulgate) as especially representative of Christian conduct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinitarian dimensions of the moral life find their fulfilment in the Beatitudes. The words that Christ spoke in the Sermon on the Mount have provided the Christian tradition with a description of the moral life that expresses all that is distinctive about life in Christ (Pinckaers 1995: 134–67). When the Christian wayfarer who has observed the Gospel Beatitudes dies, he or she passes over to the final stage of Trinitarian fulfilment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Though the three persons of the Trinity are all equal in themselves, my soul understood love in everything. And this is the knowledge of which we are most ignorant; for some of us believe that God is all mighty and has power to do everything, and that he is all wisdom and knows how to do everything, but that he is all love and is willing to do everything—there we stop…. [F]or just as through his generosity God forgives our sin when we repent, so he wants us to forget our sin of unreasonable depression and doubtful fear. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p519"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> IN his introduction to the 1998 Elizabeth Spearing translation of  <i class="calibre4">Revelations</i> I will be using here, A. C. Spearing repeats Peter Dronke's description of  <i class="calibre4">Women Writers of the Middle Ages</i>: ‘There is, more often than in men's writing, a lack of  <i class="calibre4">apriorism</i>, of predetermined postures: again and again we encounter attempts to cope with human problems in their singularity’ (Julian 1998: xxvi). In the spirit of such writing, I will concentrate on one holy woman's moral-theological coping. As a visionary and author ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1342–1416) Julian of Norwich, England, is compelling, and perplexing. She detects divine favour within the Trinity when divine discontent seems a more direct explanation of human misery, and she finds such profligate kindness by pulling all questions through the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 494) </b>needle's eye of the cross. The crucified Jesus points her to the Trinity, and the Trinity is revealed in the copious blood. Her reading of God's joy is complete, taking in not only the Second Person of the Trinity, but the First and Third Persons as well. The crucifix presents to her the embodiment of God, Spirit, and Son, and also the focal point of all time and space. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘poynte’ is where grace and love are found, and where she seeks greater solidarity with Christ and with her kin. Such a vision of love shapes her sense of sin and safety, granting a unique perspective on the Trinity and the moral life. She reflected on these visions through a Short Text (hereafter ST) and a Long Text (LT). (Notations below indicate text and chapter number.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although some essays in this volume may remain above the fray of lived readers, as if outside of merely human time, the entry on ‘the moral life’ cannot. Ethics is a vivified endeavour for the faithful, and so this essay must not only describe but also connect Julian's Christocentric Trinity to worship and discipleship. Julian's voice testifies to wellbeing in </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Holy Church’ over the dissonance of contagion and crisis in her own time. During plague, Julian, paradoxically, saw safety. Rather than seeking well-being through separation from those who suffer, Julian prays to receive a repetition of all human suffering, as it is compressed in Jesus. Through the cross, she receives a kind of redemptive contagion. Inasmuch as anxiety over pandemic still besets Christians, Julian's visions may be read as strong solace. Pulling together the two quotations above, we may see Julian's odd version of the Trinity as answering the ‘unreasonable depression and doubtful fear’ brought on by a crisis of plague. Playing on Priscilla Wald's note above, this fourteenth-century anchoress addresses an ‘undertow of panic’, that makes it ‘ever more difficult to ask how we want to live’. By attending to several features of her text and her context, readers may connect Julian's words of wellness today to ecclesial practices of lived, liturgical solidarity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">When Adam Fell</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Julian sees ‘love in everything’. This, she believes, in the ‘knowledge of which we are most ignorant’. Through ‘generosity’, God ‘is all love’, and this is beyond the usual reckoning. Divine Omniscience, often connected with the Third Person of the Trinity, and Divine Omnipotence, often referenced with the First Person, are both easier to comprehend than full-on Divine Love. However, living into Julian's  <i class="calibre4">Revelations of Divine Love</i> is an invi</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p520"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> tation to live out past the ‘stop’ of sin. Past this barrier, the faithful may ‘forget’ ‘unreasonable depression and doubtful fear’ and see the moral life differently (LT: 73). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this vision of God's goodness, Julian weaves tightly the three persons of the Godhead, threading the entire Trinity through the needle of Christ's Passion. Early in the Short Text, Julian explains that she ‘dared not’ … ‘look away from the cross’, for, apart from the cross, she would perceive only ‘the ugliness of fiends’. Through tightly focused vision, she deems she is ‘safe and sound’ (ST: 10). With prayerful stitching over many  <b class="calibre3">(p. 495) </b>years, Julian works on sin in relation to such safety, and she eventually comes to some clarity about a confusing parable of a Servant and a Lord. By the time of her Long Text, Julian is definite that she knows the Trinity through Jesus, and she comes to recognize all of humanity by way of this Jesus-defined Trinity. One salient passage from the parable is worth quoting at length as we begin:</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the servant is comprehended the second person of the Trinity, and in the servant is comprehended Adam, that is to say, all men. And therefore when I say ‘the Son’, it means the Godhead, which is equal with the Father, and when I say ‘the servant’, it means Christ's Humanity, which is truly Adam. The servant's nearness represents the Son, and his standing on the left side represents Adam. The lord is the Father, God; the servant is the Son, Christ Jesus. The Holy Ghost is the equal love which is in both of them. When Adam fell, God's son fell; because of the true union made in heaven, God's son could not leave Adam, for by Adam I understand all men. Adam fell from life to death into the valley of this wretched world, and after that into hell. God's son fell with Adam into the valley of the Virgin's womb (and she was the fairest daughter of Adam), in order to free Adam from guilt in heaven and in earth; and with his great power he fetched him out of hell. (LT: 51) Julian sees the servant as comprehensively two distinct characters: the Second Person of the Trinity, and Adam. She further discerns that God knows all of humanity by way of uniting Adam and the Son. In the decades between the composition of the Short Text and the Long Text, Julian finds that God perceives humanity through this unity of Jesus and Adam, without remainder. There is no aspect of residual anger in God's perception of miserable humanity, fetched out of hell. In his introduction to his translation of Julian's texts, A. C. Spearing reads her parable as allowing her ‘to see reality as God sees it’: The orthodox solution to the problem of predestination and free will was that for God, who exists in eternity, past and future coexist in an eternal present to which the ‘present of this brief and fleeting moment’ is the nearest human equivalent. In the parable Julian apprehends this divine vision of reality not as theory but as experience. (Julian 1998: xxxi) Thus, in what is arguably the most complicated vision of the text, Julian closely entangles Jesus with Adam so that they can no longer be seen apart from one another. She further identifies the Trinity through the divine sacrifice that accomplishes atonement. The para</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p521"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> ble narrates, as if in time, a truth that Julian perceived by compressing time, through prayerful concentration on the cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This aspect of Julian's vision has been a scandal. By one reading, the parable reflects Julian's inability to reckon with human responsibility for the horror we inflict upon one another. If I read him correctly, this is how David Aers judges her in his  <i class="calibre4">Salvation and Sin</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By collapsing ‘the will to sin, the choices against divine grace are assimilated into the language of “payne”, of suffering, for which there is no “blame” ’. Aers is concerned ‘that the strategy here systematically diminishes human responsibility for evil and, equally systematically, banishes the discourse of divine justice as though this might be in conflict <b class="calibre3">(p. 496) </b>with divine love’ (Aers 2009: 161). Julian may seem to be hopelessly and uncritically naive—all shall be well, no worries—but her vision is in fact a full-blooded one, in more than one sense. For if God took within the Trinity not only humanity, but humanity in the form of the fallen servant, then this bleeds people together, blurring blood lines by which the Host was to be parcelled in the Body of Christ, the Holy Church. When Frederick Bauerschmidt astutely observes that Holy Communion in the fourteenth-century Church was ‘a complex rite that depended on the participants properly performing their distinct functions’ (Bauerschmidt 1999: 18–19)—which included details such as a strictly hierarchical reception of the body and the restriction of the blood to the clergy—he presents us with a medieval picture of a fractured world that Julian would have seen and which her revelations could heal. For instead of shoring up the division within society and among its people, the amity within the Trinity spills out abundant, floor-soaking blood from the brow and side of Christ, marking all without distinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aers, nevertheless, reads  <i class="calibre4">Revelations</i> as impotent to rectify the misery humans inflict upon one another in an ongoing struggle for power: ‘Julian's theology does not, probably cannot, address collective life and its domination by will and power alienated from God and the covenants. It cannot address the stuff of the earthly city’ (Aers 2009: 170). Therefore, in Aers’ opinion, Julian's view is anaemic, inasmuch as the sins of ‘collective life’ are driven by ‘domination’. Yet sins of ‘collective life’ may also result from humiliation and shame. Julian may be read as countering the vices that collect on the underside of a society driven by domination. Put in different imagery, there is a gnarled knot of vice that tangles up with anxiety and self-protective conformity. During times of social unrest, the pressure to cohere and conform tightens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One moral-theological task during the fourteenth century was to give an account for senseless loss during a crisis of plague and the failure of last rites. (We will discuss this further below.) Answers from the topside involved God's wrath and God's reinforced order, but Julian answers with a total game change. By this reading, she radically digs into the root of dread over the state of one's own soul and the souls of those who appear lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is one way to read Bauerschmidt's interpretation so that it answers Aers's concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Grace Jantzen's words, Julian wishes for ‘the passion of Christ and its costly transformation of life, so that her subsequent life would be more closely identified with the values represented by the dying Christ’ (Jantzen 1988: 59). Her singular focus on the Second Person of the Trinity, and her identity of God's will with the work of Jesus on the cross, Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p522"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> may be her perceptive, scene-shifting answer to a moral crisis of her time. She compresses time and categories for a reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Proper Time</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If Julian is known to the general reader, it is likely not so much for her understanding of the Trinity, but for the refrain running through both the Short Text and the Long Text of her  <i class="calibre4">Revelations</i> that ‘All shall be well’. I submit that Julian's vision of ‘well’ is connected to <b class="calibre3">(p. 497) </b>her tightly woven take on temporality and locality. Early in the Short Text, Julian perceives God ‘in an instant’ (ST: 8). A footnote in Elizabeth Spearing's translation clarifies, ‘the word used by Julian,  <i class="calibre4">poynte</i>, can mean a point of space or of time’ (Julian 1998: 181). The corresponding passage in the Long Text reads: I saw God in an instant [or  <i class="calibre4">poynte</i>], that is to say, in my understanding, and in seeing this I saw that he is in everything. I looked attentively, seeing and recognizing what I observed with quiet awe, and I thought, ‘What is sin’: For I saw truly that God does everything, no matter how small. And I saw that truly nothing happens by accident or luck, but everything by God's wise providence. (LT: 11) Most of Julian's visions are disconcertingly non-narrative, occurring as if on a  <i class="calibre4">poynte</i>. As A. C. Spearing puts it, her perspective ‘abolishes temporal extension’ (Julian 1998: xxxi). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the passage above, ‘God's wise providence’ is not an affirmation pulled along toward resolution through a series of victories, whether minute or remarkable. ‘Accident’, from Julian's perspective, is eliminated not through episodes wherein loss (tragic or slight) brings forth blessing (profound or precious). Through this prism of thought, God does not move temporality from time A to B to C. Neither does God move a set of characters from location 1 to 2 to 3. Julian perceives ‘God's wise providence’ in an eye-blink or, as in another of her visions, compressed into the form of a small nut. Poet Denise Levertov has suggested that Julian ‘ask[s] us to turn our gaze inside out’, to see ‘a little thing, the size of a hazelnut, held safe in God's pierced palm’ (Levertov 1988: 75). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spearing's note and Levertov's images may also guide a reading of Julian on the Trinity, through a reconfiguring of temporality. As Julian receives divine love, the crucified Jesus points her to the Trinity, and the Trinity is revealed in the copious blood of Jesus. This cruciform emphasis on ‘the whole Trinity’ is formally akin to Julian's explanation that she understands God ‘in an instant’, or within small completion (as in a hazelnut). Julian writes: ‘Jesus wishes us to consider the delight which the Holy Trinity feels in our salvation … The whole Trinity took part in the Passion of Christ, dispensing an abundance of virtues and fullness of grace to us through him’ (LT: 23). The ‘dispensing an abundance of virtues’ is related to the ‘fullness of grace’ that allows for a sense of plenty, and this plenty emerges from her concentrated focus on God's will of love. Julian suggests Jesus prompted her, and now prompts her readers, to focus in on the joy of the entire Trinity in the work of salvation wrought through the Passion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> Why focus so intently on God's joy? What might appear to be a muddled collapse of categories may also be read as Julian's refusal to succumb to despair. Julian suggests readers consider their world not from the vantage point of exacting righteousness—that is, with due judgement and penalty—but from the perspective of a Godhead who perceives humans through the Passion of Christ. Time, space, and the souls who inhabit both, may be rightly regarded only through the Passion, through the work that God performs on time, space, and souls. This may be one way to read Julian's passage on ‘two different ways’ of envisioning ‘things’: <b class="calibre3">(p. 498)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We should not on the one hand fall too low, inclining to despair, nor on the other hand be too reckless, as if we did not care, but should recognize our own weakness without concealment, knowing that we cannot stand even for the twinkling of an eye unless we are protected by grace. We should cling reverently to God, trusting in him alone; for man and God regard things in two quite different ways; it is proper for man humbly to accuse himself, and it is proper for God in his natural goodness kindly to excuse man. (LT: 52)</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ are to perceive that existence is ‘protected by grace’. Without such protection, ‘we cannot stand even for the twinkling of an eye’. This is connected to Julian's counsel that one ‘recognize’ … ‘weakness without concealment’. This section is replete with visual metaphors. Perceiving that God regards humans with an intent of gracious protection, Julian suggests that her readers observe themselves ‘without concealment’, that is, without barring God's view. To put this without Julian's eloquence, a Christian should not fear God's gaze, because God perceives with grace. There is no hidden aspect of Holy Trinity that harbours accusation. The Trinity, perceived through the Passion, invites trust, because Jesus’ blood is more than sufficient to allow for open and honest self-accusation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perceiving oneself with God's perception in mind may allow even the shamed to ‘cling reverently to God’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It may help some readers to gain their bearings by way of Thomas Aquinas here. In his <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i>, regarding the effects of grace ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I-II, q.113), Thomas asks two questions that are apropos to Julian's  <i class="calibre4">Revelations</i>. In article 7, Thomas asks ‘Whether the justification of the ungodly takes place in an instant or successively?’ and, in article 8, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Whether the infusion of grace is naturally the first of the things required for the justification of the ungodly?’ Here Thomas considers different ways of perceiving grace, depending on one's position in relation to time. In the reply to objection 5 of article 7, he goes on to explain that ‘the succession of opposites in the same subject must be looked at differently in the things that are subject to time and in those that are above time’. For ‘those that are above time’, there is no ‘continuous time’, or, ‘no continuity of time’. Human understanding is ‘subject to time’ and therefore ‘understands with continuity and time’, even though, as ‘justified’, ‘the human mind is, in itself, above time’. As temporal beings, humans perceive even timeless things within time. Thomas's examination of grace and time then continues as he discusses the order of ‘the justification of the ungodly’. Using metaphor, he explains that ‘the removal of darkness’ and ‘illumination’ are, technically, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘simultaneous in time’, as with ‘the forgiveness of sin’ and the ‘obtaining of justice’. The Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p524"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> question of timing comes into play only in regard to human perception. The sense of sequence depends on whether the perceiver is the person to be justified or the source (or </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘agent’) of justification:</p>
<p class="calibre1">And since the infusion of grace and the remission of sin regard God Who justifies, hence in the order of nature the infusion of grace is prior to the freeing from sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if we look at what is on the part of the man justified, it is the other way about, since in the order of nature the being freed from sin is prior to the obtaining of justifying grace. ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I-II, q.113, a.8, ad1)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given that God is timeless, God knows the activity of justification as ‘simultaneous’. But the person of faith sees herself as forgiven first, and made righteous second. Thomas <b class="calibre3">(p. 499) </b>also suggests here that a person of faith might rightly view God as forgiving subsequent to her movement toward righteousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Julian seems to be stitching and unravelling right along the same seam, with a blood-red thread. She is trying to discern what difference it makes for the faithful to know that God perceives humans by way of the cross. Much of the form and content of Julian's texts, both the shorter and the longer, affirm a temporal collapse whereby faithful perception regards each ‘small, humble, and simple’ little thing through the cross. In this characteristic passage, Julian is concerned about the import of her visions for the apparently insignificant ‘things’ (or, I shall suggest below, people) who might appear to be ‘forgotten’: At one time our good Lord said, ‘All manner of things shall be well’; and at another time he said, ‘You shall see for yourself that all manner of things shall be well’; and the soul understood these two sayings differently. On the one hand he wants us to know that he does not only concern himself with great and noble things, but also with small, humble, and simple things, with both one and the other; and this is what he means when he says, ‘All manner of things shall be well’; for he wants us to know that the smallest things shall not be forgotten. (LT: 32) She continues, connecting the plight of the apparently lost with the horror of human suffering. When ‘our good Lord’ affirms that ‘all manner of things shall be well’, this includes specifically ‘deeds’ that are ‘so evil’ that they appear as void. The ‘things’ that seem to be so small as to be nothing, and the terror that seems to disintegrate all meaning, may be perceived as ‘treasured up and hidden in his blessed breast’ (LT: 32). And here Julian makes a definitive move: ‘for just as the Holy Trinity made all things from nothing, so the Holy Trinity shall make all well that is not well’ (LT: 32). The Holy Trinity needed neither time nor matter to create space and temporality. The Holy Trinity has the power again to make goodness out of small things that may appear to us almost invisible and out of events that seem stripped of meaning. God  <i class="calibre4">wills</i> to make goodness out of human non-sense. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Does Julian lose more than she gains with this idiosyncratic take on the Trinity? By focusing on the cross, and by compressing human history (great events or small people) into a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘poynte’ within God's a-temporality, does Julian misplace human meaning? Grace Jantzen suggests that Julian's ‘desire for unity with God in Christ is not an escape from social responsibility’. Rather, the ‘Christ-centeredness of her spirituality’ is a sign of her desire to unite with Jesus’ ‘self-giving love: a compassion which extended to all of humankind’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jantzen links this desire to Julian's initial request for wounds, a request that brings forth her visions. By this reading, Julian is seeking ‘greater solidarity with suffering humanity, identifying simultaneously with the suffering of Christ and of humankind, and thus able to mediate his compassion’ (Jantzen 1988: 61). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 500) </b>I have already suggested in passing that a rich, connective way to read Julian's impulse is in relation to the perils of her time, especially the plague, the inescapable tragedy of fourteenth-century England. As Jantzen explains: People died, horribly and suddenly and in great numbers. It was so contagious that one contemporary witness describes how anyone who touched the sick or the dead immediately caught the disease and died himself, so that priests who ministered to the dying were flung into the same grave with their penitents. It was impossible for the clergy to keep up with all those who required last rites, and to die unshriven was seen as a catastrophe of eternal proportions. Nor could the people who died be buried with dignity … The psychological impact on the survivors was incalculable, made worse in subsequent years by the further outbreaks which occurred at unpredictable intervals. (Jantzen 1988: 8) The estimate is that in Norwich itself ‘probably more than a third of the population succumbed’, and ‘at least fifty per cent of Norwich clergy perished’. Julian's determination to see the Holy Trinity through the bleeding Christ may be her unflinching meditation on the horror of this loss, rather than her escape from it. The body of Christ was to provide liturgical protection against the eternal meaninglessness of human loss, writ in the life of a loved one and in the life of a people. Yet, during this period, there appeared to be not only insufficient earthly food (with repeated, widespread famine) but insufficient access to Jesus’ body. MA graves would have signified not only loss of life, but loss of liturgical meaning. This contrast also matters: Julian envisioned the Trinity by way of the Body during a time when the sacrament of the Body appeared to have failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It may be useful again to relate Julian to Thomas Aquinas, specifically his discussion of mercy in relation to grief, from the  <i class="calibre4">Summa</i> ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.30, a.2). He explains, ‘one grieves or sorrows for another's distress in so far as one looks upon another's distress as one's own’. This can happen by way of a ‘union of the affections, which is the effect of love’, or </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘through real union, for instance when another's evil comes near to us, so as to pass to us from him’. Thomas goes on to explain that mercy born of wisdom is the contrary to ‘false godliness’. False godliness assumes that freedom from suffering is due to virtue. Julian Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p526"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> may be read, through Thomas, as seeking a veritable godliness. She prays to receive a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘union of the affections’, or, to connect several strands of meaning here, Julian prays to receive a redemptive repetition of contagion. As one who has survived human misery, she avoids the sensible path of relief and instead seeks costly, Christ-formed solidarity. Her visions grant her a duplication of suffering, through connection to the cross, which resolves unimaginable suffering with compassion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would suggest that Julian's bodily focus on the cross avoids false godliness in favour of wise mercy. She envisions a path away from three versions of vice that attend grave suffering. By perceiving a Triune God who pulls all time and meaning into the cross, Julian avoids despair over the fate of those who seem eternally lost. By envisioning a Triune God who wills to recreate goodness out of horror, Julian avoids insensibility to the abiding, incarnate goodness of God's creation. By receiving a bodily gift of holy contagion, Julian eschews the false pride that would secure the order of God's goodness by  <b class="calibre3">(p. 501) </b>way of a morbid tally of divine justice. And to pull together Julian with the two passages from Thomas (on illumination and on mercy), she perceives that ‘by his own gracious light’, God ‘wants us to understand’, even in a time of horror, ‘our noble and excellent creation’, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘our costly and precious redemption’, and the gifts God ‘sustains out of love for us’ (LT: 42). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">His Loved Bride</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to appreciate the flow of  <i class="calibre4">Revelations</i>, we should note that Julian's Long Text and her actual life culminate in the Holy Church. Her visions have been read (and celebrated or condemned) as universalist. This universalism is set within God's embodied reassurance that Holy Church is continually bound together, and wound up with Holy Trinity, through the love of Christ. She perceives unity at a time of fractures within the Church, from Lollards and peasants to rulers and papacies. The last sections of her Long Text circle around the at-one-ing work (pardon the conceit) of the Trinity, inasmuch as God is ‘a real and true bridegroom’, who says to the Church, as to ‘a bride with whom he is never displeased’, ‘I love you and you love me, and our love shall never be divided’ (LT: 58). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Layering images of intimate love, Julian also turns to the vocation of mothering. Her maternal language for the Godhead is connected to her sense that Holy Church is the place where one ‘find[s] our dearest Mother’ and ‘the comfort of true understanding with the whole blessed community’ (LT: 61). During schism, plague, and famine, the Church is, for Julian,  <i class="calibre4">Home</i>. Within the Holy Church, ‘Jesus can feed us with himself, and he does so most generously and most tenderly with the holy sacrament which is the precious food of life itself’ (LT: 60). This revelation connects back to one of her first (and most vibrant) visions: The beauty and vividness of the blood are like nothing but itself. It is as plentiful as the drops of water which fall from the eaves after a heavy shower of rain, drops which fall so thickly that no human mind can number them … This showing was alive and vivid, horrifying and awe-inspiring, sweet and lovely. And what comfort</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p527"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> ed me most in the vision was that our God and Lord, who is so holy and awe-inspiring, is also so familiar and courteous. And this was what gave me most happiness and the strongest sense of spiritual safety. (LT: 7) Julian affirms safety in the blood that flows, immeasurable, given to her in God's vision and through the ‘holy sacrament’ by which God's loved ones are sustained. Note here that God's will for wellness is located in blood, at a time when the body of Jesus was distributed either with stultifying attention to class hierarchy or not given at all, as priests and parishioners were being thrown into the same mass graves. (It is worth noting that the blood is technically not in play, as the laity do not receive.) Further, the outward manifestation of the Body was being torn by violent divisions. Here, in the mix of this mess, Julian affirms that the Church is Mother. Within a swirl of sin and misery, God  <b class="calibre3">(p. 502) </b>draws God's people together. Her focus on ‘Holy Church’ may be an attempt to avoid heresy. But it is also an affirmation that God had not abandoned the body of Christ: ‘for a single person may often feel broken, but the whole body of Holy Church has never been broken, nor ever shall be, for all eternity’ (LT: 61). This need not, necessarily, mean compliance with the willed sin of the men ostensibly in charge. It may be a call to remain within Holy Church, trusting that the sacrament of Christ's Body, within the Body of Holy Church, is salvific in spite of the men in power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This reading of Holy Church connects to Julian's sense of an absence of anger within the Trinity. Julian envisions safety in Holy Church at a time when a sensible soul might turn in dismay (or run in fear) from a deity who would allow such suffering. She sees God's love evident in a broken body at a time when broken bodies were strewn, burned, and lost Read in this way, there is tension in her suggestion that ‘if God could even be slightly angry we could never have any life or place or being’ (LT: 49). Julian's Christological account of the Trinity is to turn the gaze of the faithful away from what could be read in the fourteenth century as God's rage toward some, and toward what seems impossibly hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">—that is, God's favour for all. Julian thus sorts out God's showing, ‘in these gracious words, “I hold you quite safely” ’ (LT: 61). To those who have apparently survived God's wrath, Julian announces that a theological explanation of plague by way of divine wrath is nonsense. There is no divine wrath, for, if there were, there would be no survivors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Christianity with Christ</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Spearing writes about the puzzle of translating Julian's medieval English, in particular the sections on the Servant and the Lord, as the parable ‘has a meaning that stands outside time’ (Julian 1998: 185). I recommend a slight variation on Spearing's helpful note. Julian sees in a way that is not so much ‘outside time’, as it is set within the liturgical time of Holy Church. The vision is a-temporal for a purpose. Sacramental temporality is, seen from one vantage, ‘outside time’, but Julian's temporality involves a kind of Christological looping, pulling time backward and forward through the central focal point of the cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This reading creates problems of ‘tense’ for Julian's readers today, as it is so drastically unlike the default sense of time for Christians in the progressive, Darwinian West. The de</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p528"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> fault marking of time for Christians in the one-third world involves the upward movement of progress, from point A to B to C. Time is not only linear, but ascends through human initiative and ingenuity. A liturgical marking of time requires turning one's perspective </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘inside out’, to use again Denise Levertov's phrase. People whose lives involve cyclical patterns of memory appear, from the vantage point of modernity, ‘backward’ (to use a colloquialism). Yet Julian's vision of the Trinity loops each individual, generation, and era (even a ‘forward’ era)  <i class="calibre4">back</i> through the loving work of Jesus on the cross. She affirms </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘that the love of God unites us to such an extent that when we are truly aware of it, no man can separate himself from another’ (LT: 65). Her perspective brings together as <b class="calibre3">(p. 503) </b>kin the unshriven and the survivors, peasants and papacy, yesterday and today, compressing space and time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such a compressed perspective may re-narrate faith and contagion. The resolution in <i class="calibre4">Revelations</i> requires entering into the suffering Jesus, in bodily solidarity with the lost souls in question. Julian's answer to the apparent loss of God's favour in Jesus’ body is re-entry, past the ‘stop’ of ‘doubtful fear’. Inasmuch as western Christians remain anxious over liturgical legitimacy in the face of human suffering, this fourteenth-century anchoress is pedagogically powerful. This retelling requires that her readers note a basic contrast. The medieval mechanism of redemptive meaning was liturgical, not medical-scientific. For Julian's modern readers in the West, the default mechanism of human meaning in the midst of bodily chaos is not so much liturgy, as medical science. Arguably, institutions like the World Health Organization have replaced Holy Church as sites for recovering redemptive meaning in times of inexplicable loss. Human ingenuity, combined with increased intelligence, is supposed to allow each generation of westerners to move away from the primordial loss of meaning that haunts deadly contagion. With knowledge and diligence, time is supposed to ascend, away from suffering itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Julian's Trinitarian logic is vital for solidarity during contagion. By modern, western logic, otherwise westernized Christians who live into ecclesial kinship with non-western Christians already risk, in non-contagious time, a sort of shame. They appear as if to be slipping down the slope of social evolution and scientific progress, inasmuch as the crucifix attests to a non-progressive logic of time and meaning—seeming not only foolish in a Pauline sense, but atavistic, or even primitive. Pandemic both blurs and accentuates the boundaries between peoples presumed to be at point A and those presumed to be at point C up the arc of social and scientific progress. As disease criss-crossed distinctions of class and of clergy during the fourteenth century, communicable disease today makes our common mortality conspicuous, even while western images present non-western carriers as less socially evolved. Peoples from the two-third world represent social devolution, and for westerners to worship in common a bleeding Jesus is, in multiple ways, an offence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here I am drawing on Priscilla Wald's trenchant analysis in  <i class="calibre4">Contagious</i>, as she explains that immigrants from areas other than western Europe have variously appeared in the North American context (for example) as ‘a distinct danger to the reproduction of white America’ (Wald 2008: 113–14). Coverage of HIV/AIDS across the US and western Europe played on a register of social-Darwinian shame, suggesting the one-third world was, Page 11 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p529"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Moral Life: Julian's Trinitarian Logic of Love and Contagion</b> through contagion, at risk of ‘thirdworldization’. The rhetorical backdrop involves the risk of ‘return’ to ‘the medical primitivism of the pre-antibiotic world’ marking ‘the failure of science, civilization, and modernity’ (Wald 2008: 238). During 2009, coverage in the United States of H1N1 played repeatedly on such anxieties, depicting Latino-Catholic worshippers as carriers of cultural and actual contagion—as sources of what Harvard historian Samuel Huntington calls ‘hispanization’. By his (tragically influential) reading, the Jesus-centred liturgy of Latino-Catholic worship represents an affront to the civic, vaguely <b class="calibre3">(p. 504) </b>deist faith in progress that Huntington terms ‘Christianity without Christ’ (Huntington 2004: 106). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Julian's Long Text closes with her suggestion that her visions are ‘not yet completed’, but still to be lived out (LT: 86). Her Catholic perspective on Trinity is a timely source of safety: And I received no other answer in showing from our Lord God but this: ‘What is impossible to you is not impossible to me. I shall keep my word in all things and I shall make all things well’. (LT: 32)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her showing defies a modern, deist logic of separation in favour of solidarity, even during times of plague. As noted in this modern call by Pope John Paul II, bloody kinship requires no less:</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Church no one is a stranger, and the Church is not foreign to anyone, anywhere. As a sacrament of unity and thus a sign and a binding force for the whole human race, the Church is the place where illegal immigrants are also recognized and accepted as brothers and sisters.

<p class="calibre1">This article explores the between prayer and the doctrine of the Trinity, focusing on the insights from such figures as Thomas Aquinas, Saint Augustine, John Henry Newman, and Hans Urs von Balthasar. It explains Augustine argued that the proper use of contemplation is the worship of the Triune God, Aquinas believed that petitionary prayer is mediated through the predestination of Christ, von Balthasar held that contemplative prayer is centred on the humanity of Christ and Newman's “real assent” relates to the liturgical appropriation of individual dogmas of faith. It suggests that prayer require the confluence of invocation and meditation, made possible in various forms by real assent to God revealing himself in the humanity of Christ as the mediator/intercessor/propitiator and inspiring us by his Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: prayer, Trinity, Thomas Aquinas, Saint Augustine, John Henry Newman, Hans Urs von Balthasar, contemplation, Triune God, convocation, meditation INVOCATION is one of the commonest forms of prayer, practised by pagans, Jews, Muslims, Christians, and even non-believers. It has a ‘unitary’ orientation, as contrasted with meditative prayer, which considers the different facets of God. The most typically Christian form of prayer is intercession, because one intercedes  <i class="calibre4">through</i> the mediatorship of Christ: intercession is specifically Trinitarian. Liturgical intercessions indicate the full deity of each of the three persons. Augustine argued that the proper use of contemplation is the worship of the Triune God. For Aquinas, petitionary prayer is mediated through the predestination of Christ. Newman's ‘real assent’ relates to the liturgical appropriation of individual dogmas of faith. For von Balthasar, contemplative prayer is centred on the humanity of Christ, as the object of ‘real assent’ and as the source of our knowledge of how to pray to the Triune God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity, Through the belief in the threeness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the confession of the oneness</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the Creator of Creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus begins St Patrick's Breastplate. Known to scholars as the ‘Lorica’, Patrick's invocation is an exemplary Trinitarian prayer. The speaker ‘puts on’ the divine Triunity as a shield and a spell:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I summon today all these powers between me and those evils, Against every cruel merciless power that may oppose my body and soul, Against incantations of false prophets, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 506) </b>Against black laws of pagandom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against false laws of heretics, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against craft of idolatry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against spells of witches and smiths and wizards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against every knowledge that corrupts man's body and soul. (Patrick 1953: 69–72)</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Warding off’ belongs to our picture of invocation. The invocation makes an appeal against present danger, but assurance of response is there in Patrick's ‘I summon’. The speaker ‘puts on’ the authority of the Trinity over  <i class="calibre4">all</i> powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Homely Christians used to say, with satisfaction, ‘there is no such thing as an atheist in a fox-hole’. Their theoretical brethren took this as evidence of a universal ‘religious sense’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against this, some philosophers of religion question whether people spontaneously  <i class="calibre4">invoke</i> God. Thus, D. Z. Philips speaks with approval of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's telling a man who was screaming ‘God’ during an air-raid, ‘it will be over in ten minutes’. For Philips, the story shows that the man was no Christian, so he was not  <i class="calibre4">really</i> praying. Philips thinks we need to discern whether a prayer plays a ‘ <i class="calibre4">religious</i> role’ in the speaker's life to say whether it deserves to be called prayer (Philips 1965: 115–16). Philips wants to distinguish authentic religious prayer from superstition so as to deny that an innate religious sense will leap out of us in those invocations we make in fox-holes. It does seem circular to include God as a real object, in a definition of prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, a good, strong invocation does make an  <i class="calibre4">absolute</i> appeal. Phenomenologically speaking, invocation is an absolutist act, expressing an absolute need by calling out to one who is  <i class="calibre4">absolutely capable</i> of answering. Invocation is a suppliant  <i class="calibre4">summoning</i>. It has the  <i class="calibre4">imperialism</i> of one who assumes he matters to God. For a moment, Bonhoeffer's companion childishly hoped that someone  <i class="calibre4">cared</i> that bombs were dropping near him. Invocation assumes a bond between the appellant and the one invoked. When it's a practical emergency, the agnostic homes in on one helper. In this crude sense, some  <i class="calibre4">one</i> being </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘is what all men call God’, in invocatory prayer (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.2, a.3). Still, the agnostic is monolatrous only in the sense that king penguins are monogamous: seasonally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p533"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘Lorica’ catalogues the means of assistance against danger. Invocation leads him into <i class="calibre4">meditation</i> on the multiple facets of his God. Meditation is at the opposite end of the spectrum of prayer to invocation. Its context is not immediately practical but speculative. This kind of prayer is a loving consideration of the distinct features of God. The Puritan John Owen gave us a near unequalled meditation on the specific characters of the three divine persons, expanding upon the ‘electing love of the Father, the purchasing love of the Son, and the operative love of the Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">Of Communion with God the Father, Son and Holy</i> <i class="calibre4">Ghost</i>, Pt. II, ch. VIII (Owen 1965: 182)). Where invocation tends to be synthetic, meditation tends toward analysis. It can drift away from invocation into inference and lose its unitary drive. Its concrete object will then recede from the mind's eye. So Owen sometimes recalls us to the one God: ‘By what act soever we hold communion with any person’, he says, ‘there is an influence from every person to the putting forth of that act’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The divine nature is the reason and cause of all worship; so that it is impossible to worship any one person, and not worship the whole Trinity’: ‘It is denied by the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 507)</b> schoolmen, and that not without ground, that the formal reason and object of divine worship is in the persons precisely considered’ ( <i class="calibre4">Of Communion</i>, Pt. I, ch. III; Pt. III, ch. VIII (Owen 1965: 18, 268)). This may sound scholastic, but it is in keeping with the Christian experience of prayer. Christians do not imagine or conceive the recipient of their prayer as three separate beings. They spontaneously invoke God as One. Invocation without meditation tends blindly to settle on any one helper, but meditation without invocation tends toward an empty horizon. Prayer in its fullest sense requires a confluence of meditation and invocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this fullest sense, prayer does not ask, ‘is  <i class="calibre4">anyone</i> out there?’ The prayer that unites invocation and mediation  <i class="calibre4">names</i> the advocate it summons. Like the acts Newman called real assents, such prayers ‘realize’ the deity in the summoner's mind: as Job said, after his ordeal, ‘With the hearing of the ear I have heard Thee, but now mine eye seeth Thee’ (Newman 1979: 77–80). Christians believe that prayer has a unitary and concrete focus only because God has given it one. Jean Corbon, who wrote the ‘Prayer’ section of the 1992  <i class="calibre4">Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, ‘in beleaguered Beirut … taking shelter in his basement … to continue working during the bombardments’ (Ratzinger and Schönborn 1994: 23), describes our desire to pray in terms of God's desire for us, coming together in Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The energy of the holy God, his communion of love, is permeated by … a passion: to be ‘with the children of men’ (Prov. 8:31). At the origin … of each and every human being … there is this outpouring of love within the Trinity, … from the gaze of the Father in his beloved Son there springs up God's thirst … for human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus too, in the very beginning the human nostalgia for God is born…. The entire drama of history is located in the tension between this gift and this acceptance: God's passion for human beings, and the nostalgia of human beings for God…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the river of life joins the energy of acceptance it acquires a name; at last there is a name in which the Father utters himself and utters his beloved Son: Jesus…. The river would acquire a name only when it flowed up out of a new fountain. Then the name would ring out like an echo: there would be as it were an en</p>

<p class="calibre1">counter of two thirsts that slake each other by giving themselves a name. (Corbon 1988: 18, 22)</p>
<p class="calibre1">At its fullest, prayer is brought about not by an innate religious sense but by the Mediator in whose name it is made, and in whose Spirit it is inspired. This is why prayer is Trinitarian. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Prayer as Intercession</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians pray to the Father, in the Son, through the Spirit. Their prayer is ‘mediatorial’, as when St Patrick says</p>
<p class="calibre1">I arise today</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the strength of heaven:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Light of sun, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 508) </b>Radiance of moon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Splendour of fire, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speed of lightning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swiftness of wind, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Depth of sea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stability of earth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firmness of rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Intercession’ may be a peculiarly Christian term for prayer. Though ‘intercession’ seems like just another word for prayer, Muslim, Jewish and Christian prayers are not identically </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘intercessory’. Jews pray  <i class="calibre4">for one another</i>, as Moses prayed for the people, assuming the stance of ‘first amongst equals’. Muslims may also pray for one another. Conversely, in the Gospels, ‘Jesus does not pray together with the apostles. He cannot, for his relationship to the Father is not the same as theirs’ (Balthasar 1986: 182). Jesus’ stance reflects his status as divine–human mediator. Christian prayer is intercessory because it is Trinitarian: Christ, the divine–human Mediator, intercedes for us to the Father, to send us his Spirit to enable us to pray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">St Paul asserts that ‘we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words’ (Rom. 8:26–7). In his  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i> (paragraph 693), Thomas Aquinas interprets this to mean, ‘the Holy Spirit makes us ask, inasmuch as he causes right desires in us … aris[ing] from the ardour of love, which he produces in us’. The Dominican Herbert McCabe thinks Rom. 8:26–7 entails that ‘it is God who prays. Not just God who answers prayer but God who prays in us in the first place’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘In prayer’, he believes, ‘we become the locus of the divine dialogue between Father and Son…. For us to pray is for us to be taken over … by the Holy Spirit which is the life of love between Father and Son’ (McCabe 1987: 220–1). Thomas himself rejects such an interpretation of Romans 8. Remarking that Paul's ‘statement’ that  <i class="calibre4">the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words</i> ‘seems to support the error of Arius … who held that the Holy Spirit is a creature and lower than the Father and Son’, Thomas argues that ‘intercedes’ means here, ‘makes  <i class="calibre4">us</i> ask’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i>, Page 4 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p535"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">paragraph 692; and  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.83, a.10, ad1). He thinks it subordinationist to envisage the Son or Spirit praying to the Father. So he states that it is the ‘assumed … human nature’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Son which intercedes for us and he thinks Paul in Romans 8 is speaking of how we are ‘direct[ed] and incit[ed]’ by the Holy Spirit in prayer (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.83, a.10, ad1; and  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i>, paragraph 693). For Thomas, it is not the Holy Spirit who ‘sighs’ but a human being, inspired by the Spirit to ‘pray … longingly’ with ‘desire’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘for heavenly things which are postponed for the soul’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i>, paragraph 693). John Owen interprets Rom. 8:26–7 along the same lines, observing that, ‘For a soul to know its wants, its infirmities, is a heavenly discovery’. The Spirit enables us to ask for what would otherwise be unimaginable or inconceivable: ‘He that hath this assistance can provide no clothing that is large and broad enough to set forth the desires of his heart…. the more the saints speak, the more they find they have left unspoken’ ( <i class="calibre4">Of Communion</i>, Pt. II, ch. IV (Owen 1965: 123)). Corbon observes that </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The Holy Spirit is our pedagogue in prayer’: ‘before the Holy Spirit lays hold of us, “we do  <b class="calibre3">(p. 509) </b>not know  <i class="calibre4">how</i> to pray properly” (Rom. 8.26), but once he has brought us into the prayer of Jesus, we will not know  <i class="calibre4">what</i> we pray  <i class="calibre4">for</i>: we will simply pray’. This way of interpreting ‘intercession’ keeps the humanity of Christ at the centre of the picture. This is important because it is Christ's humanity which makes intercessory prayer possible: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We can receive the Spirit of Jesus only because Jesus assumes our body’ (Corbon 1988: 144–5, 63). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gift of the Spirit to enable our prayer is a result of what Owen calls a ‘fruit’ of historical events: Christ ‘intercedes with his Father, that’ the Spirit ‘may be bestowed on us as a fruit of his death’ ( <i class="calibre4">Of Communion</i>, Pt. II, ch. IX (Owen 1965: 198)). That's the Trinitarian picture, of how humankind got into a hole and is levered out of it. It is because intercession is offered for us by the  <i class="calibre4">humanity</i> of Christ that humankind is not just compelled to pray for ‘what God knows best’. Rather, when the ‘Spirit breaks forth  <i class="calibre4">out of the very core</i> of the believer's spiritual life, … stirring him…and praying with him’, we are led to pray for what we human beings most desire (Balthasar 1986: 77, my italics). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Liturgical Prayer: Basil of Caesarea (329/30–</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">79)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘Breastplate’ covers the speaker in the powers known from liturgy: I arise today</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the strength of Christ's birth with his baptism, Through the strength of his crucifixion with his burial, Through the strength of his resurrection with his ascension, Through the strength of his descent for the Judgement Day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Before there was a “doctrine” of the Trinity, Christian prayers invoked the Holy Trinity’ (Wilken 2003: 31). Pre-Constantinopolitan Christians had not yet figured out a notional system to match the reality of their liturgical prayer. They knew what invocation looks like, for the art of the Catacombs depicts the  <i class="calibre4">Orans</i> in heaven: her opened hands Page 5 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p536"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">are a picture of ‘asking’. In Newman's terms, Father, Son, and Spirit were ‘real’ to the earthly  <i class="calibre4">Orans</i> of the fourth century, and by that token, ‘particular’: she knew to invoke the divine persons ‘one by one’, but had not laid out the ‘Dogma of the Holy Trinity’ into a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘whole made up of many propositions’ (Newman 1979: 122). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Basil of Caesarea uses baptism to draw out the objective implications of the ‘real assents’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">we give in prayer. To confess the Three at baptism is to pronounce what Basil calls ‘saving words’. ‘[H]earing the titles of the Spirit’ invoked ‘raise[s]’ the  <i class="calibre4">Orans</i> ‘to the supreme nature’, to the one God ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> IX.22 (Basil of Caesarea 1895: 15)). Basil's argument is often paraphrased as being that, since Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are named as acting in baptism, unless we maintain their unity-in-divinity, we are polytheists. Basil contends that we  <i class="calibre4">cannot</i> effectively invoke the operation of any one divine person without the others. Baptismal invocation of the Three entails belief that each of the Three equally empowers our salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 510) </b>Basil claims that the Son and Holy Spirit enable us liturgically to worship the Father: I testify to … every man who calls upon God but rejects the Son, that his faith is vain; to every man that sets aside the Spirit, that his faith in the Father and the Son will be useless, for he cannot even hold it without the presence of the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For he who does not believe in the Spirit does not believe in the Son, and he who has not believed in the Son does not believe in the Father…. it is impossible to worship the Son, save by the Holy Ghost; impossible to call upon the Father, save by the Spirit of adoption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invocation implies need and that the one addressed can supply the matter: the Spirit, Basil says, ‘is called holy, as the Father is holy, and the Son is holy, for to the creature holiness was brought in from without, but to the Spirit holiness is the fulfilment of nature, and it is for this reason that He is described not as being sanctified but as sanctifying’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This liturgically evidenced power creates the ‘rule of faith’ whereby Basil finds a pattern of divine, sanctifying ‘operations’ ascribed to the Spirit in Scripture, from ‘conferr[ing] </p>
<p class="calibre1">grace on creation’ to the expulsion of demons and resurrection from the dead ( <i class="calibre4">On the</i> <i class="calibre4">Holy Spirit</i> XI.27, XIX.49 (Basil of Caesarea 1895: 17–18, 30–1)). The baptismal invocation of the Spirit gives ground for meditation on the Spirit's sanctification within all creating and recreating acts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Basil observes, ‘There is close relationship with God through the Spirit, for “God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father” ’. The Spirit's gift of filial intimacy with the Father fulfils our human vocation ‘to be made like unto God’. The yearning to ‘see truth’ which prayer exhibits comes from the design which originated us. As the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘origin of sanctification’ the Spirit is ‘light perceptible to the mind, supplying … through itself illumination … in the search for truth’. As Image, or Son, God is spiritually perceptible. Basil depicts prayer as a beholding which shapes the  <i class="calibre4">Orans</i>: ‘it is impossible to behold the Image of the invisible God except by the enlightenment of the Spirit’.

<p class="calibre1">Alone and in multitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine attributed a ‘clouded’ … ‘intuition’ of Trinitarian wisdom to the Neo-Platonist philosophers. The Pythagoreans and Ionians having developed philosophies of nature, and Socrates having taught the ethical life, Plato ‘united’ the two, creating the ‘trio’ of ‘moral philosophy’, relating to ‘action’, ‘natural philosophy, devoted to speculation’, and ‘rational philosophy’. When Augustine says that Plato's disciples ‘may … have some such a conception of God as to find in him the cause of existence, the principle of reason, and the rule of life’, he means that they have in a sense found Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If, Augustine says, human beings are ‘so created as to attain’ to the one true God, ‘without whom no being exists’ (the Father), ‘no teaching instructs’ (the Word), ‘no experience profits’ (the Spirit), ‘then we should seek him in whom for us all things are held together’ (the Father), ‘we should find him in whom for us all things are certain’ (the Word), ‘we should love him, in whom is found all goodness’ (the Spirit). Augustine's common ground with the Platonists stops there. For, as he complains, they ‘thought it right to render worship to a plurality of Gods’. He contends that these gods are immoral, indeed, demonic, and it is not intelligent ‘to humble yourself before a being whom you would hate to resemble in the conduct of your life and to worship one whom you would refuse to imitate. For … the supremely important thing in religion is to model oneself on the object of one's worship’. It took Augustine's conscious Christian faith to take the Platonic notion of the ‘copy's’ imitation of its archetype and redefine it as worship. Hellenistic Platonists practised spiritual exercises, designed to ‘immortalize’ their souls. Augustine's argument Page 7 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p538"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">is vulgarly intended to show that ‘all men desire happiness’, that all ‘men fear to die’, and that exercising oneself on the One will not in fact avert this unhappy fate. Suggesting an analogy between our own existence, and the eternal existing of God, Augustine invites his readers to ‘gaze at his image in ourselves, and “returning to ourselves” like the younger son in the Gospel story, … rise up and go back to him from whom we have departed in our sinning. There our existence will have no death, our knowledge no error, our love no obstacle’ ( <i class="calibre4">The City of God</i> X.29; VIII.2–4; VIII.12, 17; X.1; XI.27–8 (Augustine 1972: 414, 299–304, 316 and 324, 371, 361, 463)). Augustine  <i class="calibre4">prolerizes</i> philosophical meditation. By equating contemplation with worship, he shows it belongs to the everyday  <i class="calibre4">Orans</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine pictures worship as propitiation, offered ‘by our priest, his only-begotten Son’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘sacrifice of humility and praise’ is given to God ‘on the altar of the heart … and the flame … is the burning fire of charity’. For Augustine, Christ, in the form of the servant, is the very form of humility. Christian sacrifice is the giving back of the human form to its source: ‘By our election of him as our goal—or rather by our re-election (for we had lost him by our neglect)…. we direct our course towards him with love’ (that is, by the Spirit). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Worship ‘re-forms’ the human person in the form of its maker: ‘the soul … become[s] </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 512) </b>a sacrifice when it offers itself to God, so that it may be kindled by the fire of love, and … lose the “form” of worldly desire’, and may be ‘re-formed by submission to God as to the unchangeable “form”, thus becoming acceptable to God because of what it has received from his beauty’. By his sacrificial reception of our ‘form’, Christ returns it to God: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the true Mediator (in so far as he “took the form of a servant” and was made “the mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus”) receives the sacrifice “in the form of God”, in union with the Father, with whom he is one God’ ( <i class="calibre4">The City of God</i> X.3, 6, (Augustine 1972: 375,  379,  400)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine argues that it's impossible to catch ourselves out  <i class="calibre4">beginning</i> to remember, know and love ourselves: the mind ‘always remember[s] itself and always … understand[s] and love[s] itself’. The propulsion to gravitate toward the Trinity has been there ‘from the moment this great and wonderful’ human ‘nature begins to be’: the ‘image’ of the Trinity ‘is always there, whether it is so worn away as to be almost nothing … or clear and beautiful’. Augustine knows by faith that the image needs to invoke God to escape the fox-hole of sin, where death awaits it. When he claims that ‘the worship of God is man's wisdom’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">he means that we attain happiness not by travelling in a circle, back to ourselves, but by returning to our maker. He says that the ‘trinity of the mind is not really the image of God because the mind remembers and understands and loves  <i class="calibre4">itself</i>, but because it is also able to remember and understand and love him by whom it was made. And when it does this, it becomes wise’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>, X.4.19, XIV.2.6, XIV.1.1, XIV.4.15 (Augustine 1991: 299, 374, 370–1, 383)). </p>

<p class="calibre1">St Thomas observes that ‘the greater the charity of the saints in heaven, the more they pray for wayfarers … and the more closely they are united to God, the more are their prayers efficacious’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.83, a.11). Commenting on Paul's statement that he ‘remembers’ his converts before God, Thomas notes that, ‘when the saints <b class="calibre3">(p. 513) </b>pray for certain people, they are somehow presented to His gaze’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i>, paragraph 83): the prayer ‘lays the request on the tabernacle’, before God. As the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in Beijing came to their bloody end, in June 1989, I cut the photograph of the student standing in front of a line of tanks from  <i class="calibre4">The Times</i> and placed it under the tabernacle. Thomas says that Christ </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘intercede[s] for us in two ways. In one way … his intercession for us is his will that we be saved [Jn 17:24] … In another way he intercedes by presenting to his Father's gaze the human nature assumed for us and the mysteries celebrated in it’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i>, paragraphs 83 and 720, citing Heb. 9:24). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern Thomist philosophers have emphasized that Aquinas defined prayer as petition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomist philosophers want to show how it makes sense to request things from a God who has from eternity decided all outcomes. Writing against what he calls ‘a loss of nerve about prayer as petition’, Simon Tugwell claims that Thomas successfully produced a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘demonstration that petition does make sense’. Thomas ‘vindicates the theological and religious seriousness of the ordinary prayers of ordinary Christians’ by categorizing prayers as secondary causes, which God uses to achieve outcomes in the same way as he uses physical events to do so (Tugwell 1987: 47). When Thomas says, ‘our motive in praying is, not that we may change the divine disposition, but that, by our prayers, we may obtain what God has appointed’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.83, a.2,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.), he means that God eternally folds our prayers into the divine scheme, giving our prayers the ‘dignity of causality’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.23, a.8, ad2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A philosophical reading of Thomas's statement that ‘we pray, … that, by our prayers we may obtain what God has appointed’ takes it to mean, in general, that prayer is our permission to enter the engine room. This is linked to Thomas's theology of the Trinity by the <i class="calibre4">humanity</i> of Christ. When Thomas says that God allows our prayers to have the ‘dignity of causality’, he is talking about predestination (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.23, a.8, ad2). Theologically, Thomas is thinking of the spot in the engine room where our petitioning personalities are forged. He says it is fitting that the person of the Son should become Incarnate because, like a ‘craftsman's mental word’, the Son is the ‘exemplar for all creation’, and Page 9 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p540"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">especially of the human, as an ‘intelligent being’, and because the ‘purpose’ of the Incarnation is to achieve ‘the predestination of those who are preordained for a heavenly inheritance…. Through him who is Son by nature men share by adoption in a likeness to his Sonship ….  <i class="calibre4">Those whom he foreknew he predestined to share the image of his Son</i>’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.8). Thomas claims it was more beautiful for God to free humanity by means of the Passion than by ‘dispossess[ing] the devil by sheer power’ because ‘in this way a greater dignity accrues to man. Man has been overcome … by the devil. But it is a man who overcomes the devil’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.46, a.3). Through the passion of Christ, a man becomes by grace the cause of our salvation. Christ's human nature is the pattern of our predestination (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.24, a.1 and a.3). Christ's humanity is the junction between God and the human  <i class="calibre4">Orans</i>. It is by analogy to the dignity of his predestined humanity that our prayers are taken as ‘secondary causes’. The theological basis of Thomas's argument that our prayers are allowed to be causes is Christ's </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘election’ by the Father: ‘the predestination of Christ’, he says, ‘who was predestined <b class="calibre3">(p. 514) </b>to be the son of God by nature, is the measure and rule of our life, and therefore of our predestination, because we are predestined to adoptive sonship, which is a participation and image of natural sonship’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Romans Commentary</i>, paragraph 48). For Thomas, petitioning God is certainly ‘a way of getting things done’ (Tugwell 1987: 37), but that is because prayer is how we invoke our adoptive sonship, in Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit ‘coaches’ us to pray in love, which means to ask for what we need to become God's children. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarianism without a Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Recent scholars have suggested that the Trinity was first marginalized not with Schleiermacher, but in the era of the Test Acts (Dixon 2003: 208–9). In place of John Owen's meditation on the economic operations of Father, Son, and Spirit came disputations in defence of Trinitarianism. These treatises went down before the Unitarians’ counterblasts like wooden ducks. For the ‘rule of faith’ no longer ‘functioned as a  <i class="calibre4">means of grace</i> to assist people’ in coming ‘to know, love’ and ‘interact with … the triune God’. Instead, Scripture was conceived as ‘a source containing clear and intelligible propositions to be consulted’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">before giving ‘intellectual assent’. There was ‘a shift from  <i class="calibre4">doxological</i> to  <i class="calibre4">epistemological</i> activities’ as the way to approach the Trinity (Vickers 2008: 104, 29–30, 37). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Samuel Clarke delivered the Boyle Lectures of 1704, going out to bat for the  <i class="calibre4">Being and</i> <i class="calibre4">Attributes of God</i> against Spinoza, deism, and atheism. Dividing atheists into three types, the ‘ignorant and stupid’, the ‘debauched’, and those who have argued themselves into the condition, Clarke addressed only the latter, as the only group ‘capable of being reasoned with’. He argued  <i class="calibre4">a priori</i> that there must be a self-existent being, which causes all else: for ‘to arise out of nothing absolutely without any cause’ is ‘a plain contradiction’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clarke deduced that the self-existent being must have necessity, incomprehensibility, eternity (though not in the manner ascribed to it by the ‘Schoolmen’), infinity (ditto), unity, intelligence, liberty and choice, and infinite power. God must be a ‘free and voluntary agent’ because ‘intelligence without liberty … is no intelligence at all’. Clarke set out logi</p>

<p class="calibre1">cally to demonstrate that God is one person, and he defines a person as an intelligent and free agent (Clarke 1704, ed. Vailati 1998: 3, 12, 31–3, 46). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was bad news for the Son and the Holy Spirit. In the  <i class="calibre4">Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</i> (1712), Clarke drew the logical conclusions that ‘The Father alone is Self-existent’, that </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the Son is not self-existent; but derives his being, and all his attributes, from the Father, as from the supreme cause’, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Generation, when applied to God, is but a figurative word, signifying … immediate derivation of being and life from God himself…. Among men, a son does not, properly speaking, derive his being from his father; Father … signifying … an instrumental, not an efficient cause: But God, when he is stiled Father, must necessarily be understood to be [αιτια] a True and Proper cause, really and efficiently giving Life. Which consideration, clearly removes the argument usually drawn from the equality between a Father and Son upon earth. (Clarke 1712: 123, 136–7) <b class="calibre3">(p. 515) </b>The frontispiece to his book shows how Clarke interprets Trinitarian prayer. Below the title,  <i class="calibre4">The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity, </i> we read ‘That you will continually pray <i class="calibre4">to</i> God  <i class="calibre4">the</i> Father,  <i class="calibre4">by the</i> Mediation of our only Saviour Jesus Christ, for the heavenly assistance of the Holy Ghost’ (‘Exhortation in the Office for ordaining of Priests’). In interaction with his own copy of the  <i class="calibre4">Book of Common Prayer</i>, Clarke sedulously effaced any trace of lese-majesty with respect to the Supreme Cause. He turned the doxology (‘Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost’), which follows the Psalms, into </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Glory be to God by Jesus Christ through the heavenly assistance of the Holy Ghost’ (Dixon 2003: 33). When Clarke's private version was printed, the redactors divined Clarke's intent, and the doxology following Psalm 95 became ‘Glory be to the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God’ ( <i class="calibre4">The Book of Common Prayer, Revised (</i> Clarke 1823: 6)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clarke was criticized by Christian and Unitarian alike, compelled to foreswear discussing the Trinity, and finally harpooned as a tritheist by the Jesuit Edward Hawarden's question, ‘Could the Father annihilate the Son and the Spirit?’ (Dixon 2003: 203). His schema is Tritheistic because it effectively accords to the Son and Spirit the ‘dignity’ of second causality. It is as ‘lesser deities’ that Son and Spirit ‘carry’ the prayer to the omnipotent Father. Clarke's defence of the revealed character of Christianity from Christ's miracles was an exercise in ‘extreme evidentialism’ (Burns 1981: 99–100). But this use of Christ's miracles shows that Christ is a ‘sign’ of God, not that he is God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John Owen assumed by faith that the ‘Schoolmen’ had accurately denoted the metaphysical being which the economic ‘offices’ of the persons of the Trinity exhibit (Owen,  <i class="calibre4">Of</i> <i class="calibre4">Communion</i>, Pt. II, chs. 1 and 2). Samuel Clarke contends that, outside the ‘personal characters, offices, powers and attributes delivered in Scripture’, ‘[a]ll reasonings … beyond what is strictly demonstrable by the most evident … light of nature … are … but probable hypotheses’ (Clarke,  <i class="calibre4">The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</i>, Pt. II, 4). Commenting on the ‘methodical processes of inference’ by which Clarke demonstrated the interconnection of the Supreme Cause's attributes, Newman wondered if they would perturb a Page 11 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p542"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Prayer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">reasonable atheist. Such majuscule ‘words’ as Perfection, Knowledge, Eternity, and Justice, he says, ‘speak to those who understand the speech. To the mere barren intellect they are but the pale ghosts of notions’. In order to be ‘personally prepared’ for Clarke's demonstration of the logic of theism, Newman claims, one must not only think the abstract terms but imagine their force as concrete nouns. ‘We must’, he says, ‘rest in the thought of the Eternal, Omnipresent, and All-knowing, rather than of Eternity, Omnipresence, and Omniscience’ (Newman 1979: 249–50). </p>
<p class="calibre1">John Owen says that ‘Everything of Christ is beautiful’, and the love of this beauty is evident in his writing. He interprets the Song of Songs Christologically, and there is a sensuality in his description of the divine eros. Owen writes, ‘The Father loves us, and … sheds </p>
<p class="calibre1">… the Holy Spirit richly upon us, through Jesus Christ’. ‘In the pouring out of his love, there is not one drop falls besides the Lord Christ.’ ‘Love in the Father is like honey in the flower;—it must be in the comb before it be for our use’ ( <i class="calibre4">Of Communion</i>, Pt. II, Dig. I; Pt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">II, ch. I; Pt. I, ch. III (Owen 1965: 74, 40–1, 27)). Von Balthasar observes that despising beauty is tantamount to being unable to pray (von Balthasar 1992: 18). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Newman (1801–93)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the ‘Breastplate’, Patrick imagines the created cosmos as mirroring God's beauty: I arise today</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the strength of heaven:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Light of sun, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Depth of sea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stability of earth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firmness of rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of these singulars can imaginatively represent to us a ‘facet’ of God's perfections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, according to Newman, we cannot  <i class="calibre4">notionally</i> conceive of all God's perfections ‘in a single blow’. What ‘holds of the Divine Attributes’, he says ‘holds also of the Holy Trinity in Unity’. So far as we attempt to  <i class="calibre4">think</i> the unity of the Trinity ‘the notion and the thing part company’: the unity of the Trinity is a mystery to our generalizing minds. But neither Scripture nor the Creeds call the ‘dogma’ of the ‘Three in One’ a ‘mystery’. The reason is that the Creeds evoke not intellectual or notional, but  <i class="calibre4">imaginative</i> assent. Newman says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the Creeds have a place in the Ritual; they are devotional acts, and of the nature of prayers addressed to God’. Real or imaginative assent is addressed to singulars, and each of the propositions in the Creeds, like ‘the Son is God’ or ‘the Spirit is God’, refers to a concrete singular reality. Feasts like Christmas and Easter are liturgical exegeses of ‘the Son is God’, The ‘breviary offices for Pentecost’ create ‘a place in the imagination and the Page 12 of 16</p>

<p class="calibre1">heart’ for ‘the Holy Spirit is God’. As Newman sees it, ‘theology’, the realm of notional assent to truth, ‘has to do with the Dogma of the Holy Trinity as a whole made up of many propositions’, whilst ‘Religion’, the domain of real assent, ‘has to do with each of these separate propositions … and lives and thrives in the contemplation of them’ (Newman 1979: 117, 56, 121–2). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Contemplative Prayer:Hans Urs von Balthasar</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The most sung verse of the ‘Breastplate’ speaks of the tangible face in whom we pray: Christ to shield me today</p>
<p class="calibre1">Against poison, against burning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against drowning, against wounding, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Christ in every eye that sees me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ in every ear that hears me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking of meditative contemplation, von Balthasar observes that we ‘seek out the Lord's earthly form’ … ‘in prayer’ … ‘to see, hear and touch’ … ‘the love of God’ … ‘in the humble form in which it offers itself to man’. The cornerstone of Christian prayer is the figure of Jesus, where history opens into the eternal Trinity. Using Kant's terminology, von Balthasar argues that ‘Since concepts are empty apart from perceptual content, we cannot draw near to God and his threefold mystery … except through the Incarnation of Christ. The concepts of the doctrine of the Trinity, divorced from Jesus’ relationships with the Father and the Spirit, ring hollow. They do not foster contemplation of the divine; at most they allow the logical mind to indulge in self-congratulation. Conversely, … perception apart from concepts is blind, as is evident in that type of contemplation and exegesis of the gospel … which fails to see, hear and touch, in the historical manifestation … the manifestation of the truth and the life of God himself’ (Balthasar 1986: 129, 271). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Psalms contain what we could call ‘invocations followed by meditations’: first an urgent appeal to God, followed by a description of God's saving help. These are the prayers which Jesus prayed. Von Balthasar speaks of how it ‘is in the Son that the Father can predestine … us to be his children, fellow children with the one, eternal Child, who … intervenes as sponsor’. As we advance in prayer, we learn that ‘all’ our ‘stammering is only an answer to God's speaking’ to us: for ‘It was God who spoke first…. Just think of the Our Father which we address to him every day: is not this his own word? Were we not taught it by the Son of God, who is God and the Word of God’ (Balthasar 1986: 44, 14).

<p class="calibre1">This article examines the relation between feminism and the doctrine of the Trinity. It highlights feminists' concerns about traditional Trinitarian theology's the use masculine language about God. It argues that the use of feminine metaphors to describe God should not lead to a rejection or replacement of the names for the Trinity given in Scripture and tradition, since divine paternity does not mean that the immaterial Father is male. It suggests that the generation of the Son is a model for both human motherhood and fatherhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: feminism, Trinity, masculine language, Trinitarian theology, Scripture, divine paternity, motherhood, fatherhood</p>
<p class="calibre1">TRADITIONAL Trinitarian theology uses masculine language about God that feminists often find troubling. The Church speaks of the unoriginate  <i class="calibre4">Father</i> as the eternal source of divinity, the eternal Son who speaks as Word from the Father's silence and becomes incarnate as Jesus Christ, and the Father eternally  <i class="calibre4">begetting</i> the Son. Such language can make the Trinity appear to feminists, to quote Karen Blixen, as ‘the most deadly dull of all male companies’ (Svendsen 1974, cited in Ware 1986: 6). In an effort to be more inclusive, the Holy Spirit is often said to be feminine. This ultimately does not solve the problem for feminists. When the Spirit is thought to hide within or behind the Father, Son, and human persons, revealing their excellence, not her/his own (Lossky 1976), the concept of a female Spirit appears to provide divine authorization for human social structures in which women are called to support and enable men but their own voices cannot be heard. Accordingly, feminist theologians have sought, in various ways, to find alternative names for all of the divine persons. Sallie McFague (1987) speaks of God as mother, lover, and friend; Elizabeth Johnson (1994) envisages the Trinity as three kinds of wisdom: Spirit-Sophia, Jesus-Sophia, and Mother-Sophia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in addition to the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Christian theologians throughout history have spoken of the Trinity in feminine terms. In the second century, Clement of Alexandria speaks of Christ's human body and blood as the milk that Page 1 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p547"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Feminism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">feeds his faithful children and of the divine Logos as the Father's breast that conveys the milk of life to us. Here, the mother and her breast form a parallel to a better-known second-century metaphor for Father and Son, the mind and its speech. Clement also speaks of Christ's suffering on the Cross as the labour pains in which Christ, as mother, gives birth to the Christian people (Harrison 2003; Wood 1954: 39–46, 277–8). In his  <i class="calibre4">Homilies</i> <i class="calibre4">on the Song of Songs</i>, the fourth-century theologian Gregory of Nyssa finds feminine images for the three divine persons in the rich metaphorical language of the book he interprets. In the Seventh Homily, he understands the bridegroom's mother as God the Father, since here ‘mother’ and ‘father’ have the same meaning because there is no gender in the divine nature. Elsewhere, Gregory also speaks of the Father as the ‘life-giving mother’ of humanity. In the First Homily on the Song, the Son is identified as  <b class="calibre3">(p. 520) </b>Sophia, the female wisdom figure in the book of Proverbs. In the Fifteenth Homily, the Holy Spirit is named as a mother dove giving birth to the bride who is a daughter dove (Harrison 1996: 39–40; McCambley 1987). In the fifteenth century, the English mystic Julian of Norwich returns to some of the themes found in Clement, though a direct influence seems unlikely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She speaks of the second person of the Trinity as Son and Bridegroom but also as Mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘And so in our making’, she says, ‘God almighty is our loving Father, God all wisdom is our loving Mother, with the love and goodness of the Holy Spirit, which is all one God, one Lord’ (Julian 1978: 293). She sees the same Creator at work in our redemption: ‘Thus in our Father, God almighty, we have our being, and in our Mother of mercy we have our reforming and our restoring, … and through the rewards and the gifts of grace of the Holy Spirit we are fulfilled’ (Julian 1978: 294–5). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Theological Language and the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early Church and in the Middle Ages, a recognition that words and texts have multiple levels of meaning and that religious language is often metaphorical or allegorical was intrinsic to people's ways of thought, writing, and prayer. Because Clement, Gregory, Julian, and their contemporaries recognized these different levels of meaning and saw them in context, they had no difficulties with combining traditional and feminine language for the persons of the Trinity. Julian's medieval readers were not shocked if she called Christ ‘Son’ and ‘Mother’ in the same sentence, or named Jesus as ‘Mother’, then referred back to ‘him’. In allegorical or symbolic discourse, traditional concepts for the Trinity and feminine language were not perceived as threatening each other. Feminine language was unusual but provided insights that added to more familiar concepts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet people also weighed carefully the meanings, presuppositions, and implications of all language about God and critiqued what they saw as misleading. It was important to be clear about the distinction between doctrinal language, which had been honed through the debates surrounding the ecumenical councils, and metaphorical language that applied the names of countless created things to the activities of the Creator. Feminists and their theological opponents today can perhaps learn from the example of their forbears to be careful but less anxious as they formulate and utilize ‘inclusive’ language about God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p548"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Feminism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In addressing issues of gender in Orthodox theology, let us recognize that God transcends our human perceptions and concepts of created things. What we know of God, even if our knowledge should exceed our experience of the created universe, forever remains less than what we do not know of God. All theological affirmations are surrounded by mystery and remain open to the presence of what surpasses our understanding. So we can always build upon what we know as we learn more, we can add to traditional language without attempting to replace it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the apophatic character of our reflection must be combined with an unequivocal acceptance of divine revelation and of the doctrinal affirmations that use concepts to express its content. These affirmations follow from the reality of the Incarnation  <b class="calibre3">(p. 521)</b> and are indispensable to Christian identity. Orthodox apophaticism must not become an excuse for agnosticism, and it does not justify replacing the concepts of God given to us in Scripture and Tradition with others of our own devising. So as the Fathers of the fourth century affirmed against their Arian and Eunomian opponents who wanted to find different names for God, the Trinity must be confessed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Gregory of Nyssa, who found feminine names for the three divine persons in the Song of Songs, makes this point unequivocally in his  <i class="calibre4">Refutation of Eunomius’ Confession</i>. He says that a replacement of the names Father, Son, and Spirit by others amounts to a denial of God revealed in Christ and a direct challenge to his authority ( <i class="calibre4">Gregorii Nysseni Opera</i> (henceforth cited as  <i class="calibre4">GNO</i>) 2: 314). He notes that these names are in no way interchangeable with the many other words and symbols used to speak of God in Scripture. So he adds to these traditional names, but he does not replace them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A patristic understanding of language about the Trinity can be summarized by distinguishing three things: <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> the strict unnameability of the divine  <i class="calibre4">essence</i>; <b class="calibre3">(2)</b> the revealed names of the three  <i class="calibre4">persons</i>; and <b class="calibre3">(3)</b> the many other names taken from the created world, ranging from the sublimity of light, life, and wisdom to the ordinariness of bread and rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This third kind of language speaks of God's creative, providential, and saving activity in the world outside his own essence, where he is manifest in and through things he has made, having clothed himself, as the poet and theologian Ephrem the Syrian has said, in a garment of words (Brock 1990: 45–9). Such words, often metaphorical, name the divine energies, to the vast yet limited extent that they are nameable. So the divine essence transcends gender along with everything else created. The divine energies—the manifestations and activities of the three divine persons—can ultimately be named for anything God creates or for anything God does in the creation. Thus, to call God ‘Mother’ is to say God acts toward us as a mother would. None of this compromises Gregory's strictness regarding the proper names of the persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Yet it allows in principle for the discovery based on Scripture that God does sometimes act like a mother, and these activities can be described in feminine language. ‘Mother’ and related feminine terms become tesserae in a mosaic icon of many symbols, but they should be viewed in Page 3 of 13</p>

<p class="calibre1">the context of the whole, with all the cautions and qualifications that entails, not given a privileged place by themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Orthodox theologians have only begun the work of reflecting within their tradition about feminist questions and responding with new ways of expressing their theology. This task is best approached slowly and cautiously. Gender concepts and symbols in patristic theology and biblical exegesis and in Orthodox spirituality, liturgy, and iconography are complex and subtly nuanced and often have multiple levels of meaning. We need to consider the presuppositions and consequences of statements we make about gender. A statement in one area can impact theological affirmations in other areas, since all of theology is interconnected. For example, if different genders and attributes or activities corresponding to them were ascribed to different persons in the Trinity, as in  <b class="calibre3">(p. 522) </b>the concept of a male Father and Son and a female Spirit, this would compromise our confession of the unity of God and of the divine energy. Similarly, we cannot rename the divine persons as Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier because all three of them participate in all of these activities. At the Protestant seminary where I teach, students habitually call the Father </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God’ and the Son ‘Jesus’. As a result, when introduced to Athanasius and Nicaea they may confuse the whole Trinity with the Father, since both are named ‘God’. And they may have difficulty grasping that the divine Logos existed with the Father from all eternity, and only when he became incarnate was he given the human name ‘Jesus’. Early Christians struggled to clarify the meanings of these theological terms. To replace them is to lose the clarity of our Christian theological heritage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feminists who want to replace the names Father, Son, and Spirit with others or define God's essence as feminine disagree fundamentally with the Orthodox Church. And yet, as I will argue here, traditional Orthodox understandings of God and the human need not be oppressive to women. In this essay, we will seek to explain these understandings more fully in ways that accord with Christ's love for all human persons. We will discuss the three topics in Trinitarian theology that are most apt to concern feminists: the Father and his begetting, the maleness of Christ; and the Trinity as a model for human community. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In thinking of God the Father, one is struck by his awesome humility. From eternity to eternity, he gives his own essence, all that he is and has, all his attributes including his sovereign authority and power, to the Son and the Holy Spirit. He does not withhold anything for himself alone but remains unique simply as the Source of the Godhead which he shares with the other two. His essence, his uncreated radiance, and all his activities are theirs also. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Trinity there exists unity, equality, and consubstantiality, yet also a certain hierarchical order. The Father is the source of the Son begotten of him and the Spirit proceeding from him. The divine energy is one yet is the presence of the three persons, and it proceeds from the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. Within their unanimity of mind and will, the Son and Spirit are said to obey the Father but as equals and in a free Page 4 of 13</p>

<p class="calibre1">and sovereign way. The Father is truly the origin of everything. When the Son obeys him, offering all that he is back to him, he is imitating and responding to the Father's original generosity, his giving all that he is to the Son in the eternal act of begetting. Given this mutuality, it is inappropriate to overemphasize a contrast between paternal authority and filial obedience in God. Such a Father would not want his own authority affirmed at the expense of his Son's authority, or that of his Spirit. Gregory of Nazianzus makes this clear in his  <i class="calibre4">Oration on Holy Baptism</i>:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would like to say the Father is ‘greater’ [Jn 14:28], from whom indeed equality and being come to those who are equal…. And I fear to call him the origin, lest I make him  <b class="calibre3">(p. 523) </b>the origin of inferiors and insult him through this preeminence; for it is not glory to the one from whom they come to abase those who come from him … For the ‘greater’ does not apply to the nature but to the cause. For nothing of those who are one in essence is greater or less in essence. ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 40.43, SC </p>
<p class="calibre1">358: 298; Harrison 2008: 138)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is difficult to hold the concept of hierarchy together with the concepts of unity of essence and will along with personal freedom, equality, mutual co-inherence and self-giving. This is perhaps why the fourth-century Church had to struggle to affirm clearly and authentically the doctrine of the Trinity. The Fathers laboured to express with integrity the knowledge of God lived and experienced by the Christian community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So is divine fatherhood a model for human fatherhood, since humans are made in God's image? Eph. 3:15 expresses the idea that a human father is in some very real sense an icon of the first person of the Trinity. This scriptural concept is troubling to feminists, since it seems to suggest that male parenthood enjoys a unique closeness to the divine that is not shared by motherhood. This interpretation could be taken to imply that Christians worship a male deity, though such a crude doctrine of God is incompatible with the apophatic approach of the Greek Fathers. Yet the relationship between divine and human fatherhood calls for further explanation. It is best understood when placed in a broader context. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the fourth century, the Arians and Eunomians accused their Orthodox opponents of viewing God's fatherhood in a crassly anthropomorphic way. Athanasius and the Cappadocians replied that the language of Father, Son, and divine generation must be understood in a way worthy of the divine. That is, generation within the Trinity does not involve gender or sexuality, which belong to humans and animals, nor is it subject to conditions of time, space, matter, planning, effort, passivity, division, or incompleteness, all of which characterize created modes of existence. Rather, in the divine, ‘Father’ means the source of Godhead who has no prior origin and the one who generates the Son. Divine ‘generation’ means that the Son comes directly from the Father's own person and is consubstantial with him. This generation is eternal and immaterial and occurs without passion, in all the senses of the word πάθος including passivity and instability as well as sensual pleasure or pain (Athanasius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Decree of the Nicene Council</i> 11–12, in Opitz 1934: 2.1.9–11; Gregory Nazianzen,  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.4, SC 250: 182–4;  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.8, SC 250: 190–2; Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p551"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Feminism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Gregory of Nyssa,  <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i> 3.1–2,  <i class="calibre4">GNO</i> 2: 30–1, 60, 73;  <i class="calibre4">Refutation of Eunomius’ </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Confession, GNO</i> 2: 348ff.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, this fatherhood is not a matter of maleness. Divine generation is unique, and how it occurs remains incomprehensible. It is not a heavenly projection of human fatherhood; rather, human fatherhood is its image. This is the point Athanasius sees as being made in Eph. 3:15, as he says in the  <i class="calibre4">First Discourse against the Arians</i>, 23: ‘For God does not imitate the human, but rather because God properly and alone truly is Father of his Son, humans also are named fathers of their own children. For from him “is every fatherhood in heaven and on earth named” ’ (PG 26: 60 C). Thus, the name ‘Father’ and the paradigmatic mode of paternal generation belong originally to God, and human fathers share them by imitating and participating to the extent possible in his manner of fatherhood. </p>
