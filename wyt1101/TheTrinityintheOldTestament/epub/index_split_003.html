<p class="calibre1">This article examines the thoughts of twelfth-century theologians in the West concerning the Trinity. It focuses on the works of Peter Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, Richard of St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor, and Peter Lombard. It explores the multiplication of models used to think about the Trinity. These include the triad power-wisdom-goodness, images in the human soul, traces in visible creation, and interpersonal love. It argues that despite the tensions at the beginning of the period, the efforts of the theologians led toward a richer doctrine, notably toward the theory of Trinitarian appropriations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, theologians, Peter Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, Richard of St. Victor, Peter Lombard, human soul, visible creation, interpersonal love, Trinitarian appropriations IN the twelfth century, notable reflections on the Trinitarian mystery led to a series of conflicts between the scholastic and monastic worlds. On the one side stood the masters, Abelard, Gilbert of Poitiers, and Peter Lombard, on the other, the monks, mostly Cistercians, William of Saint Thierry, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Joachim of Fiore. In the middle stood the canons regular Hugh, Achard, and Richard of Saint Victor, neither monks nor seculars, but religious and masters at the same time, who played the role of intermediary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps they are the reason that the conflicts of the century were less acute and more favourable to the masters, especially if they were bishops. After the condemnations of Abelard at Soissons (1121) and at Sens (1140/1) and the simple warning of Gilbert at Rheims (1148), Peter Lombard is solemnly acquitted at Lateran IV (1215) of Joachim's accusations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What brought on this desire to better understand the Trinity? First, it is the fundamental and distinctive mystery of Christianity. In the twelfth century, expeditions to the Holy Land and the translations of Greek and Arab philosophical texts put thinkers of the Latin West in contact with other conceptions of the divine, which incited them to defend the truth of their faith. At the same time, a taste for dialectic was growing in the schools and Page 1 of 14</p>

People sought the support of ‘necessary reasons’, independent of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 169) </b>scriptural authority, to understand better Christian doctrine, including the major challenge for the human intellect which is the Trinity. Boethius’  <i class="calibre4">Theological Tractates</i> furnished the model of natural, universal, and necessary reason applied to the Christian mystery. He elaborated the notions of substance, person, essence, and relation in order to better understand God as one and triune. Nonetheless, the  <i class="calibre4">aetas boetiana</i> is also the  <i class="calibre4">aetas</i> <i class="calibre4">ovidiana</i>. In the cloisters and the courts, another taste, for the theme of love, sharpened the sense of the individual, his subjectivity, and his affectivity. It also stimulated interest in Cistercian and Victorine thinkers above all for the analysis of interpersonal sentiments and relationships. From these sources, Bernard and Richard drew new models for thinking about the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the century, a question obsessed our authors: how to accord unity of substance and plurality of persons in God? How to avoid theological discourse separating into two treatises, one on God's unity, accessible to natural reason, the other on the triune God, supported by Revelation alone? Working on theological language, certain thinkers distinguished the names and formulated rules of predication (Abelard, Gilbert, and Peter Lombard). Others, insisting on divine transcendence, resisted the assaults of natural reason and revered the mystery (William and Bernard). Some found analogies in the human soul and creation (Hugh). Others proposed comparisons, that of a seal (Abelard), a kiss (Bernard), or interpersonal love (Richard). Still others meditated on plurality and its divine source (Achard). It is in this proliferation of reflection that appeared the doctrine of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Trinitarian appropriations’, a major twelfth-century contribution to Trinitarian theology (Hugh, Abelard, and Richard). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Masters</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Peter Abelard (d. 1142)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter Abelard composed three works on the Trinity, today distinguished as  <i class="calibre4">Theologia </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">‘Summi Boni’, Theologia Christiana, </i> and  <i class="calibre4">Theologia ‘Scholarium’</i>, in reality three versions of the same work. It was first entitled  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>. He never ceased refining and modifying its title, subject, purpose, layout, and tenor. Its central thesis is that ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Holy Spirit’ are the names by which Christ distinguished the ‘perfection of the sovereign good’, that is, God. Therefore, ‘Father’ names his power ( <i class="calibre4">potentia</i>), ‘Son’ his wisdom ( <i class="calibre4">sapientia</i>), and ‘Holy Spirit’ his goodness ( <i class="calibre4">benignitas</i>). The triad ‘power/wisdom/goodness’ forms therefore a bridge between Christianity, Judaism, and philosophy, so that ‘all human beings naturally have faith in the Trinity’. Objections against the unity of substance or the Trinity of persons are resolved by a careful analysis of notions: ‘same’, ‘different’, and ‘person’. The processions from the Father and the Son are explained on the one hand by plausible arguments based on the relations that unite power, wisdom, and goodness ( <i class="calibre4">Theologia ‘Scholarium’</i> ) and on the other hand by a controversial comparison <b class="calibre3">(p. 170) </b>with a seal. He distinguished the seal's matter (bronze) from its form (effigy of the sovereign); or, in a more precise way, (1) the bronze, (2) the ‘apt to seal’ ( <i class="calibre4">sigillabile</i>), and Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> (3) the ‘sealing’ ( <i class="calibre4">sigillans</i>, once imprinted in the wax). Like the divine persons, these elements are at the same time identical by essence and diverse by their properties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Abelardian doctrine was condemned twice. At Soissons (1121), students of Anselm of Laon charged that he did violence to the Trinitarian mystery by employing an inappropriate dialectical method that separated the three persons or reduced them to names. At Sens (1140/1), the Cistercians William of Saint Thierry and Bernard of Clairvaux called into question fourteen theses, several being Trinitarian: the names ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Holy Spirit’ are improper; the three persons are of unequal power; the Holy Spirit is not of the same substance of the Father and the Son; the Holy Spirit is the soul of the world; and Christ is not a third person of the Trinity. Often caricatures, these theses do not reflect the real doctrine of Abelard, but rather manifest a real difficulty of his accusers in understanding it. As a matter of fact, this doctrine is as simple in its principal affirmation as it is complex in its demonstrations and corollaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the centre is found the triad  <i class="calibre4">‘potentia—sapientia—benignitas’</i> and its identification with the three divine persons. The idea is not totally new. There are numerous precedents in the biblical, conciliar, and patristic tradition. Abelard's originality involves presenting this triad as a model that offers to natural reason a more universal terrain than Christian Revelation. In so doing, his purpose is threefold: polemical, apologetic, and theological-philosophical. He seeks: (1) to refute the theories of the ‘pseudo-dialecticians’, in particular his old master Roscelin; (2) to show that, in a certain measure, the Trinitarian mystery had been foretold or even acknowledged, outside of Christianity, by the prophets and philosophers: we find this preoccupation of universality in his  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue of a Philosopher</i> <i class="calibre4">with a Jew and a Christian</i>; and (3) to offer to reason a terrain for research and discussion, a sort of philosophical theology, in which even the strictest logic is not offended by the affirmation of the mystery of the Trinity, as found in the Scriptures, Councils, and Fathers. In his preface to the third  <i class="calibre4">Theologia</i>, Abelard explains that he wrote his work because of the spontaneous request of students who clamoured for human and philosophical reasons. They insistently sought things that we can comprehend rather than speak. They affirmed: that it is useless to pronounce words that do not result in comprehension; that one can believe nothing that is not first understood; and that it is ridiculous to preach to others that which neither oneself nor those whom one seeks to instruct is able to grasp intellectually, for the Lord himself disapproves of the blind leading the blind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this model raises two questions that neither his opponents nor Abelard himself were able to address satisfactorily. What is the precise nature of the rapport between this model and the three divine persons? Even understood as a simple analogy, does it offer a teaching on the Trinity that is compatible with Christian tradition? At times, it seems that Abelard only sees the triad as an analogy. Thus, when he declares in the  <i class="calibre4">Theologia ‘Scholarium’</i> that wisdom is a certain power or faculty to discern and that goodness is in no way a power or wisdom, he quickly adds that nonetheless the three  <b class="calibre3">(p. 171) </b>persons are equally powerful, wise and good. One can understand that these three faculties resemble above Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> all the three persons by their relations of origin. Nonetheless, Abelard had declared in the preceding  <i class="calibre4">Theologiae</i> that ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Holy Spirit’ are respectively the ‘names’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">given by Christ to the divine power, wisdom, and goodness, and that the latter ‘define’ the three persons and are ‘proper’ to them. If someone opposes his position by quoting the Creed  <i class="calibre4">Quicumque</i>, which affirms that the three persons are equally almighty, he responds that the same name can be either proper or common depending on the context. Therefore, there is no contradiction to say that power is proper to the Father and that the three persons are equally and fully powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is Abelard incoherent? Did he evolve with time, from a radical theory towards a more moderate one? Did his incomplete  <i class="calibre4">Theologiae</i> juxtapose textual layers from different periods that he put off merging better until later? Did the nature of the relationship between the triad and the Trinity remain unspecified or only implicit? It is difficult to determine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abelard's doctrine, even reduced to its central affirmation, does not reconcile easily with the anterior tradition that, prolonged by Hugh and Richard of Saint Victor, would give birth to the theory of ‘Trinitarian appropriations’. Abelard, for his part, does not </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘appropriate’ (i.e. ‘makes proper’), rather he ‘communicates’ (i.e. ‘makes common’). He does not want to explain why some attributes, that the most rigorous theology considers to be substantial and ‘common’, are sometimes applied as ‘proper’ to a particular person, but why power, wisdom, and goodness, which he holds to be ‘proper’ attributes in themselves ( <i class="calibre4">per se dicta</i>), can in certain contexts ( <i class="calibre4">in contextu … orationis</i>) become ‘common’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the Three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From common to proper or from proper to common, the difference seems slight, the essential being maintained: to demonstrate that God is indissolubly one and triune and that certain names can, according to the case, apply either to the substance or to the person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we seek to reconcile ‘authorities’ as did Abelard, the result is the same. That is why he was sincerely persuaded that his doctrine did not fall into heresy in any way. If on the contrary we consider, as they did at Laon, Clairvaux, and Saint Victor, that these ‘authorities’ do not come raw to the theologian, but are transmitted to him through an exegetical tradition that already partially articulates, balances, and interprets them, whatever his dialectical virtuosity, Abelard's abnormal theory becomes impossible to accept. This principal cause of Abelard's  <i class="calibre4">calamitates</i> in Trinitarian theology is only amplified by his provocative personality and by the difference in method. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Gilbert of Poitiers (d. 1154)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A Master in Paris and perhaps in Chartres, Gilbert of Poitiers addresses the Trinity in his commentaries on Boethius’  <i class="calibre4">Opuscula sacra</i>. He took from the  <i class="calibre4">Hebdomades</i> a metaphysical distinction between the ‘that which is’ ( <i class="calibre4">quod est</i>) or ‘subsistent’ ( <i class="calibre4">subsistens</i>: the existing thing in its concrete individuality) and the ‘that by which it is’ ( <i class="calibre4">quo est</i>) or ‘subsistence’ ( <i class="calibre4">subsistentia</i>: the formal principle that makes it be that which it is). Gilbert radicalizes this distinction and makes it the universal key to a new and coherent philosophical <b class="calibre3">(p. 172) </b>system. In theology, he also distinguishes a  <i class="calibre4">quod est</i> (‘God’) and a  <i class="calibre4">quo est</i> (his ‘divinity’). Thus, one can say that each person is ‘God’, although their common divinity is Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> unique. This distinction shocked two of his archdeacons and then William of Saint Thierry and Bernard of Clairvaux. At the Council of Reims in 1148, Gilbert defends his orthodoxy in front of Eugene III. Of four suspected theses, only the first is disapproved, even though it was not established that it faithfully expressed Gilbert's thought: ‘The divine essence, substance and nature, that one calls “divinity”, “goodness”, “wisdom”, “greatness of God”, etc., is not God, but the form by which God exists’. Pope Eugene III required that no reason separate the nature from the person and that the divine essence be predicated of God in the nominative (‘God  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the divine essence’) as well as in the ablative (‘God is <i class="calibre4">through</i> the divine essence’). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Peter Lombard (d. 1160)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the numerous twelfth-century doctrinal syntheses, Peter Lombard's  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> were by far the most influential, because of their effort to harmonize the whole of the tradition around a moderate doctrine that was principally Augustinian. The first of the four books addresses God one and triune. It examines the processions of the Son then of the Holy Spirit and the names employed in Trinitarian theology, arranged in six categories. In spite of its general moderation, two of its theses provoked debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the lost  <i class="calibre4">De unitate Trinitatis</i>, Joachim of Fiore reprimanded him for having written that </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘neither has the Father engendered the divine substance, nor has the divine essence engendered the Son, neither has the divine essence engendered the divine essence’, arguing that, if there existed in God a ‘thing’ (i.e. the ‘substance’) that is not affected by the relations of origin, this ‘thing’ is added to the three persons, thus introducing a quaternity. In reality, the Lombard rejected statements such as ‘the Father engendered the divine essence’, ‘the divine essence engendered the Son’, ‘the essence engendered the essence’, in order to avoid coming to the conclusion that the Father engendered himself. Indeed, Peter knew that Augustine affirmed that God the Father ‘engendered that which he is himself’. But he interpreted it by saying that ‘God the Father engendered from himself … </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Son, who is that which is the Father’. Against Joachim's charges, the fourth Lateran Council in 1215 proclaimed the orthodoxy of the Lombard. Another controversial point from the  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> is their identifying charity and the Holy Spirit: the Holy Spirit is the love of the Father and of the Son, by which they love each other mutually and love us. Moreover, the same Holy Spirit is the love or charity by which we love God and neighbour. When this charity is in us in such a manner that it makes us love God and neighbour, then one says that the Holy Spirit is sent or given to us; and the one who loves the love itself by which he loves his neighbour, in so doing he loves God, for love itself is God, that is, the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, charity, namely the Holy Spirit, is completely unalterable in itself, but it grows or diminishes in the heart of the person who receives it. It is therefore necessary to <b class="calibre3">(p. 173) </b>distinguish the presence of the Holy Spirit from its possession. Although being everywhere, it is neither possessed by everyone nor by irrational creatures. Against those who say that the charity of the Father and the Son is not the same charity by which men Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> love God and neighbour, but is its source, Peter responds that charity can come from the Holy Spirit while being identical with it, since the Holy Spirit gives itself to men. Finally addressing the objections that affirm that charity is an affection, a movement, or a virtue of the intellect, he responds that charity is immutable, but that the mind is affected and moved by it as if it were a virtue. Never officially condemned, this thesis was nonetheless set aside by the thirteenth-century doctors, even if they limited its scope, as did Bonaventure. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Monks</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If the principal authors are Cistercians, the black monks also meditated upon the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular the Benedictine Rupert of Deutz (d. 1129) left an immense exegetical opus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  <i class="calibre4">De sancta Trinitate et operibus eius</i> is a commentary on the entirety of Scripture following a Trinitarian reading. The Trinity manifests itself throughout the history of salvation, in such a way that the works of the three divine persons correspond to three ages: creation (Father); from the fall of Adam to the Passion of Christ (Son); and from the resurrection of Christ to the end of time (Holy Spirit). This concern to reunite Trinitarian theology and salvation history reappears in the work of Joachim of Fiore. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">William of Saint Thierry (d. 1148)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A former student of Anselm of Laon, Benedictine abbot, then Cistercian monk and friend of St Bernard, William of Saint Thierry fought the theories of Abelard, wrote an original synthesis on the Trinity, and meditated upon the assimilation of man to God one and triune. His  <i class="calibre4">Disputatio adversus Petrum Abaelardum</i> refutes the identification of the three persons with the attributes ‘power—wisdom—goodness’. In the name of divine ‘pure simplicity’, he affirms that for God to be powerful, to know and to will are the same thing. He also rebukes Abelard for only considering the Holy Spirit in its action  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> with creatures. This oversight confuses the two processions of God: on the one hand, of nature, in God; and on the other, of grace, toward creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Building upon the Latin and Greek Fathers, the  <i class="calibre4">Aenigma fidei</i> proposes a vigorous synthesis of faith in the Trinity, insisting that this part of the Christian doctrine is a mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William distinguishes (1) the essential names ( <i class="calibre4">ad se</i>) affirming the indivisibility of the divine nature, (2) the essential and relative names referring to the relations between God and creation, and (3) the names that are proper to a person and yet relative ( <i class="calibre4">ad aliquid</i>) in that each is related to the others ( <i class="calibre4">ad invicem</i>). For the first ones, the simplicity of God is such that each divine attribute signifies the whole divine essence and can be  <b class="calibre3">(p. 174) </b>indistinctly predicated of the substance or of each person. In the divine essence, there is thusly ‘neither singularity nor diversity’. Concerning the second ones, they imply in God neither mutability nor separation of persons, but the three create, govern, etc. as a unique creator or governor. Regarding the third group, William redefines ‘person’ as ‘that which is made known with certainty because of its form’. The persons are ‘three proper and relative realities’ ( <i class="calibre4">propria relativa</i>); while being relative, they are nonetheless ‘some</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> thing  <i class="calibre4">ad se</i>’, without being three essences. The intra-Trinitarian life founds the history of salvation  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>, ‘from the Father’. In creation, redemption, or prayer, the divine action is exercised ‘from the Father’, ‘by the Son’, and ‘in the Holy Spirit’, the link of charity uniting between them the three persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  <i class="calibre4">Epistola ad fratres de Monte-Dei</i> ( <i class="calibre4">Letter to the Brothers of Mont-Dieu</i>) contains the elements of a ‘Trinitarian mysticism’. In the ascension toward God, William distinguishes (1) pure faith, founded on authority alone; (2) ‘science’ or ‘the reason of faith’, which, under the control of faith, manifests that which it contains in seed; and (3) the ‘sense of the divinity’ or the ‘taste of wisdom’, communicated by the Holy Spirit, where the soul knows God no longer by reason, but by a loving experience that anticipates the beatific vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From one state to another, man is progressively divinized and further united to the three persons, through his three faculties of memory, reason, and will. In the third state, the soul is united to the Holy Spirit who unites the Father and the Son in a mutual love and reciprocal knowledge, so that ‘in an ineffable and unthinkable manner, man merits being of God, if not God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dei, non Deus</i>) and ‘that which God is by nature, man is by grace’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">William thereby develops ‘a theory of mystical experience that is  <i class="calibre4">essentially</i> Trinitarian and an approach to the Trinity that is  <i class="calibre4">essentially</i> mystical’ (Brooke 1959: 120). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A friend of William, Bernard has a doctrine that is similar but more affective. Like him, Bernard insists on the divine unity, which is indistinguishable for him from the charity that links the three persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the Council of Sens, Bernard sent intense correspondence to the Pope and the prelates to warn them about Abelard, whom he accuses of ‘disembowelling the mysteries of God’, of ‘evacuating the merit of the faith’, of being ‘ready to render reasons for everything, even that which is above reason’, and of daring ‘to do it against reason and against faith’. His principal grievance is that Abelard ‘sets up degrees and levels in the Trinity’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">with his defective model of the bronze seal or his use of the triad ‘power/wisdom/goodness’. God is ‘that concerning which one can think nothing greater’. And yet, it is greater to be supremely great in whole rather than in part. Each person is therefore the whole of that which is substance, the whole of that which are the two others. Therefore it is false to ascribe ‘properly and specially’ power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, and goodness to the Holy Spirit. It is not that Bernard critiques the link between the three attributes and the three persons: this link is found several times in his writings. But he rebukes Abelard's  <b class="calibre3">(p. 175) </b>affirmation that the three attributes are ‘properties’ of the persons. The names of power, wisdom, and goodness, being names  <i class="calibre4">ad se</i> (absolute such as ‘divinity’), are substantial and common. On the contrary, names  <i class="calibre4">ad alium</i> (relative such as ‘engendered’) are personal and singular. If power is ascribed ‘properly’ to the Father because he alone exists by himself, the same reasoning demands that he be ascribed ‘properly’ wisdom and goodness as well. Bernard goes so far as to say that Abelard lacks logic—a paradoxical reproach of this ‘new Aristotle’! The doctrine of Gilbert is moreover attacked in Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a><img src="index-188_1.png" alt="Image 20" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> <i class="calibre4">Sermon 80</i> on the  <i class="calibre4">Canticle of Canticles</i> and in  <i class="calibre4">De consideratione</i> in the name of the supreme divine simplicity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his  <i class="calibre4">Sermons on the Canticle of Canticles</i>, commenting on the first verse, Bernard delivers a lesson on the Trinity in which the literary beauty rivals its theological finesse. The Spouse of the Canticle says ‘Oh that he would kiss me with a kiss of his mouth’ (Cant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1:1). This kiss is first identified with the union of the two natures in Christ. Next it signifies the person of the Holy Spirit, who is the kiss of the Father and the Son. Indeed, each kiss proceeds from the two persons who embrace, as the Holy Spirit itself proceeds from the first two divine persons. Moreover, uniting two mouths, it is a sign of charity, peace, and unity, even as the Holy Spirit is the love of the Father and the Son and as it spreads, according to St Paul, charity in our hearts. Finally, constituted of a breath, it recalls the very name of ‘Spirit’ and this breath that the resurrected Christ breathed on his disciples saying: ‘Receive the Holy Spirit’ (Jn 20:22). When therefore the Bride, addressing the Bridegroom, asks him: ‘Oh that he would kiss me with a kiss of his mouth’, she addresses Christ and asks that the Father give the Spirit, who is also revelation of the Father and of the Son. This kiss is received on two lips: one for understanding, the other for loving that which is revealed. The two are necessary in order to receive the knowledge of the divine mysteries. Thus, a biblical and poetic image of great density recapitulates how the three divine persons—the Father who kisses, the Son who is kissed, and the Holy Spirit who is the kiss—are distinguished and united in the unique movement of uncreated charity; and how the soul's created charity is united to God's uncreated charity, while being distinct from it: for if the soul participates in the flow of love of the Father and of the Son by the mediation of the Spirit, it is the Son alone who is kissed, directly and fully, by the mouth of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 176) Joachim of Fiore (d. 1202)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A Benedictine monk, abbot, and reformer, then Cistercian and finally founder of the order of Fiore, Joachim produced a complex exegetical opus, rendered obscure by the presence of apocryphal writings. We have already mentioned that Joachim fought the Trinitarian doctrine of Peter Lombard, whom he reproached for positing the divinity as exterior to the Trinity. Moreover, he himself represented the Trinity in the form of the  <i class="calibre4">Psalterium</i> of David, that is, as a trapezoid the shortest side of which is very narrow: the Father is the summit, the Son and the Spirit are the extremities of the base, and the common sub</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> stance in the centre of the instrument is represented in the form of a circle corresponding to his table of harmony. The divinity is thus interior to the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joachim is also famous for his Trinitarian conception of history. Prolonging and modifying the typological method of scriptural explanation, he observes, between the personalities and the events of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the time of the Church, certain proportional ‘concordances’ or analogies (often supported by calculations). For those who know how to read it, the Bible offers therefore keys for understanding the present and the future. The history of salvation is punctuated by three ages ( <i class="calibre4">status</i>). The age of the Father, the period of nature and Mosaic law, corresponds to the Old Testament and the order of  <i class="calibre4">coniugati</i> (laymen). The age of the Son, period of grace, corresponds to the New Testament and the order of clergy. After persecution by the Antichrist (that Joachim thought to be close) a third age will come, period ‘of greater grace’, peace, and freedom: it corresponds to the order of the spirituals, that is, of monks. Following this there will be the attack of Gog and Magog and finally the second coming of Christ to judge mankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This Trinitarian conception of history wielded a deep influence on the Franciscan order, from Bonaventure to the Fraticelli. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3. </b> <b class="calibre3">Masters and Religious: The Victorines</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Founded before 1113 by William of Champeaux, former teacher of Abelard, Saint Victor of Paris is an abbey of canons regular, at once clergy and contemplatives, whose encyclopaedic humanism is ordered toward a deeply Trinitarian Christian wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hugh of Saint Victor (d. 1141)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugh's doctrine on the Trinity is principally expressed in the  <i class="calibre4">De tribus diebus</i>, the  <i class="calibre4">Sententiae de divinitate, </i> and the  <i class="calibre4">De sacramentis</i> (I, 2–3). The first work proves the existence of God, his unity, and his immutability and, finally, using a psychological analogy inspired by Augustine, the Trinity of persons. He attributes—probably before  <b class="calibre3">(p. 177) </b>Abelard—</p>
<p class="calibre1">power, wisdom and goodness to the three divine persons, but without insisting and as if in passing. The contemplation of the immensity, beauty, and utility of creatures awakens mankind to fear, truth, and charity and thus makes shine on us the day of the Father, that of the Son, and that of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later revisiting the issue, Hugh elaborates a doctrine of Trinitarian appropriations, mindful to differentiate his theology from the Abelardian theories. Among the ‘primordial causes’ that govern creation, the first is the divine will or goodness, accompanied by wisdom and power. Power, wisdom, and goodness: all divine attributes lead to these three, which encompass the whole divine substance. They form therefore a sort of trinity, being at once three and one, without being the divine persons, since they arise from the divine substance, equally shared by the three persons. Nonetheless, the ‘Catholic faith’, that is, the Christian tradition, ‘has assigned power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, and goodness to the Holy Spirit’, for two reasons. First, in order to correct the anthropomorphic conceptions that human language conveys: the names ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Holy Spirit’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> can evoke the impotence of the aged, the immaturity of youth, and the ruthlessness of strictness. Applying the substantial attributes to the three persons combats the excesses of human language. The second reason is more positive. Between power, wisdom, and goodness, there exist the same relations of procession as between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In each triad, the first term does not depend on any other. The second term is engendered from the first. The third proceeds from those that precede it. Finally, while distinguishing each one from the other, the three terms do not converge any less to unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is thus a structural analogy between the triad ‘power— wisdom—goodness’ (1b) and the Trinity of persons (1a). Moreover, the three divine attributes (1b) are reflected in the created perfections of visible creatures (3: immensity, beauty, and utility), while the three divine persons (1a) have as an image the three faculties of the human soul (2: mind ( <i class="calibre4">mens</i>), intellect, and will). God, mankind, and the visible universe are therefore structured in a triadic manner, following degrees for decreasing resemblance. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Achard of Saint Victor (d. 1171)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A master, abbot of Saint Victor, then bishop of Avranches, Achard is the author of a  <i class="calibre4">De</i> <i class="calibre4">Trinitate</i> or  <i class="calibre4">De unitate et pluralitate creaturarum</i>. Fragmentary and discovered late, the text expresses powerful originality. Fascinated by the metaphysical question of the one <b class="calibre3">(p. 178) </b>and the many, he demonstrates by several arguments that in God a true plurality exists, from which comes every created plurality. (1) The unity and plurality of creatures implies that in God there exists a unity and a plurality adhering to this unity. (2) The imperfect resemblance of creatures to the Creator implies that beyond them a perfect resemblance of God exists, equal to God, therefore in God. (3) The beauty coming from the aggregate of several realities surpasses each of them separately. But such beauty is greater in spirits than in bodies and greater in the uncreated spirit than in created ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It must therefore exist in God. (4) An analogous argument is sketched while replacing beauty by charity, which can only be found between several subjects; but ‘we are unable to conceive of anything better or more delightful’. This plurality is constituted by persons, who are distinguished among themselves as being Unity, Equal, and Equality, fittingly called ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Holy Spirit’ (I, 19–36). We can see here, in embryo, one of Richard's arguments on the same subject. Nevertheless, Achard's enhances more audaciously the value of plurality. Far from being a mark of finitude or a degradation of the primordial unity, it has its origin in God, where it receives its perfection. Since God is Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> alone true unity, he also is true plurality. Between God and creatures, the ontological gradation articulates itself, not by a progressive division of unity into plurality, but by a descent from God, truly one and plural, toward realities that are neither truly one nor truly plural. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Richard of Saint Victor (d. 1173)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A master, sub-prior, then prior of Saint Victor, Richard composed two famous works (known as  <i class="calibre4">Beniamin minor</i> and  <i class="calibre4">Beniamin maior</i>) on a type of contemplation that unites intelligence and affectivity. People spoke in his regard of a ‘speculative mysticism’. In a certain way, his  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> is an application and coronation of it. Here he teaches the contemplation of the principal mystery of the Christian faith using ‘necessary reasons’ in the tradition of St Anselm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">From unity to mutual love (‘co-dilection’)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In book III, Richard demonstrates that the one God is also three persons, by using three analogous arguments, founded on the notions of charity, beatitude, and glory. Their common mainspring is to apply to God a principle of maximal perfection. Since God is the supreme good, it is always fitting to attribute the best to him. ‘Nothing is better than charity, nothing is more perfect’ (VI, 2). Since charity involves tending toward the other, there is in God a plurality of persons. Likewise, the exigency of maximal felicity or glory constrains us to admit the existence in God of an equal, to whom he communicates every good. Supreme majesty could not be limited by solitary greed. The same demand of maximal perfection implies the equality of persons and their perfect unity of substance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard shows that this plurality is, more precisely, a ‘Trinity’. Indeed, these equal persons are at least three. For charity, felicity, and glory are greater when two who love each other associate unanimously a third to the plenitude of their love, felicity, and glory, without prejudice to the equality of persons. Love ( <i class="calibre4">dilectio</i>) becomes the shared love of a <b class="calibre3">(p. 179) </b>third ( <i class="calibre4">condilectio</i>), each person being in relation with the other two by a double and reciprocal affection. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Existentia of Richard</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another of Richard's novelties resides in his critique of the Boethian definition of person, which obscures the distinction between ‘substance’ (response to the question ‘What?’) and ‘person’ (response to the question ‘Who?’). He resorts to the term  <i class="calibre4">existentia</i>, which he gives a new meaning by analysing it thusly. ‘ <i class="calibre4">-sistentia</i>’ designates that which the thing is substantially. ‘ <i class="calibre4">Ex</i>-’ specifies the relation of origin that defines this thing, that is to say, if it has being because of itself or from another source. The  <i class="calibre4">existentia</i> varies therefore: by quality and origin for human beings, who have neither the same substance nor the same parents; by quality only for angels, who are all created directly by God; and finally by origin only for God, since the three divine persons are consubstantial but are different because of their relations of origin. The word ‘ <i class="calibre4">existentia’</i> applies both to the divine substance (it is thereby common) and to the divine persons (it is thereby incommunicable). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a><b class="calibre3">Scholastic Reasons, Monastic Meditations and Victorine Conciliations: The</b> <b class="calibre3">Question of the Unity and Plurality of God in the Twelfth Century</b> With this said, he replaces the Boethian definition of ‘person’ by a new one that can apply to God. The person is ‘an incommunicable  <i class="calibre4">existentia</i> of divine nature’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Examining then the relations of origin, Richard affirms the need to posit a person who exists because of itself, in order to avoid an infinite regress. Such a person is unique; if not it would be a composition or a participation in another, prior reality. From this first person, existing because of itself, the others derive in a way that is (a) immediate, (b) mediate, or (c) immediate and mediate at once. The immediate procession necessarily precedes the other two. The immediate-mediate procession is required in order that there be <i class="calibre4">condilectio</i>. On the contrary, a purely mediated procession is excluded. It would introduce inequality. All the possible processions being thus exhausted, there is no place for a fourth person, since the divine persons are distinguished by their relations of origin alone. These persons are therefore three in number. The one exists because of itself. The second draws its existence from the first. The third draws it from the other two. These three persons are given the names of ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Holy Spirit’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinitarian ‘Appropriations’</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In Trinitarian theology, Richard forges the concept of Trinitarian ‘appropriations’ (almost at the same time as the  <i class="calibre4">Sententiae divinitatis</i>) and completes the theory already sketched by Hugh. The appropriation consists in taking a common term, therefore substantial, in order to apply it more particularly to one of the three divine persons, because of the fittingness or the greater affinity between this common notion and the person in question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It refers therefore literally to  <i class="calibre4">appropriare</i> or to ‘render proper’, to move from the common to the proper. Since this word also seems influenced by it quasi-homonym  <i class="calibre4">appropiare</i>, ‘to become close’, appropriation is also in some way an ‘approximation’. As Richard explains in the  <i class="calibre4">De tribus appropriatis personis in deitate</i> (a non-Richardian title), the appropriation of common terms, practised by the Scriptures and the Fathers, aims to give mankind a certain access to that which otherwise surpasses natural knowledge. The appropriated names neither explain nor dissipate the mystery, but rather give an inkling of the mystery in an indirect  <b class="calibre3">(p. 180) </b>way, as in a mirror, while waiting for the beatific vision. Concerning the triad ‘power— wisdom—goodness’, Richard takes up a Hugonian and Abelardian explanation: the three divine perfections are united between themselves by relations of origin that are analogous to those of the three persons. There is therefore between the triad of attributes and the Trinity of persons not identification, but an analogy of structure and proportion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his doctrine of appropriation as in his notion of  <i class="calibre4">existentia</i>, Richard searches to gather together these two poles of the Trinitarian mystery, namely the unity of substance and the plurality of persons, by distinguishing them, certainly, but also by articulating them and by drawing them together as much as possible. Thus, the doctrine of this speculative thinker, who is also a contemplative, is at the meeting point between the current of the masters and that of the Cistercians. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article explores Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian theology during the thirteenth century, focusing on the thoughts of Saint Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas. It underscores the centrality of Trinitarian theology for both theologians and highlights their areas of agreement as well as their distinctive features. It explains that Bonaventure put the good and love at the heart of his account of God and emphasized the primacy of the Father. It highlights Aquinas' understanding of divine persons in terms of subsistent relations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, Saint Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, God, Father, divine persons, subsistent relations IT is not unusual in the scholarship for the Trinitarian theologies of Bonaventure (d. 1274) and Aquinas (d. 1274) to be played against each other. That there are significant differences between the two theologies is beyond doubt; there are differences in approach, stress, even particular claims. But, while the differences should not be ignored, the two great thirteenth-century theologians are united in certain basic convictions, not least about the absolute centrality of Trinity for Christian faith and a Christian understanding of reality. Bonaventure is insistent on the point, and scholars have readily accepted his assertion. Hence in the first of the disputed questions  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> (a.2  <i class="calibre4">resp. </i>), he proclaims Trinity to be the foundation and root of divine cult and of the entire Christian religion, and then specifies how this article of faith informs other truths of the faith, about creation, providence, salvation, and incarnation. Some claiming acquaintance with Aquinas, however, have been more doubtful about his Trinitarian commitments and the shape of his teaching. Several criticisms have been made of the Dominican theologian, sometimes with a nod to the, apparently, more compelling, integrated teaching of his Franciscan contemporary. To cite but a few of these criticisms: this account of Trinity is too rationalistic and jargon-laden; the intimate connection between the immanent and the economic Trinity has been broken; Aquinas’ talk of God over-emphasizes the essence and is relatively Page 1 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">inattentive to the persons; the account of Trinity, sophisticated in itself, has inadequately informed the rest of the theology; the Trinitarian teaching is simply too speculative and fails to make a difference in Christian living and practice (Scheffczyk 1995). Aquinas, however, does affirm Trinity, and with  <b class="calibre3">(p. 183) </b>Bonaventure affirms the centrality of Trinity; it is hard to see why he too should not be taken at his word. There are, he tells us ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">II-II, q.1, a.8,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.), two main categories of articles of faith, the truths revealed by God that are necessary for salvation, for coming, in the next life, to the immediate presence of God and knowing and loving God directly: those about Christ, who is the way to eternal life; and those about God, who is the beginning and end of human existence. There are seven articles, in Aquinas’ reckoning, that treat of God. Three have to do with God's activities, in creating, sanctifying, bringing the successful human journeyer to the end of eternal life. One has to do with the unity of the divine essence. The other three are concerned with the persons, who differ in person but are one and the same in divine substance and being. A single article, affirming the distinction and equality, might have sufficed, but for the explicit denial, by the Arians and Macedonians respectively, of the full and equal divinity of the second and third divine persons who truly are God ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.1, a.8, ad3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, each of the persons receives an article; what is true about the one God who is three, active in the world, must be affirmed to attain eternal life. An even more striking affirmation of the centrality of the Trinity comes earlier in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa</i> ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.32, a.1, ad3), and its bluntness is inescapable. By their natural powers, humans are unable to know the triune God, that God is a Trinity of persons. This must be revealed; and God does so reveal God. In this passage, Aquinas is clear about the significance of this self-manifestation. What difference does the revelation by God of God as triune make? It makes possible, Aquinas states, a correct understanding of both creation and salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By affirming that God creates by the Word, necessity is removed from creating. Creating is a voluntary activity that is intentional; God freely acts, according to a plan that is the Word. So too the involvement of the Holy Spirit in creating shows that God here acts by love, a love of God's own goodness that God wills in love to share with others. God need not share God's goodness, to be God; that God does, shows God's love for what is not God. And, Aquinas adds, that God is triune enables, and chiefly, a correct understanding of salvation, which is brought about by the incarnation of the Word, who as human is the way to God as beatifying end, and by the gift of the Holy Spirit. Here, Aquinas is invoking the divine missions, which are discussed in  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.43 and then at greater length later in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa</i>, as at I-II, qq.106ff. (of the grace of the Holy Spirit that is the New Law) and III, qq.1–59 (on Christ, the Word become human). For a Christian theologian, creation and salvation are not trivial or incidental matters, but will stand at the heart of theological work. Trinity, according to Aquinas, is needed for the perceptive handling of these central themes; the subsequent inquiries in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa</i> will have, then, a Trinitarian cast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas and Bonaventure would seem to share a second, fundamental conviction: the affirmation of God as triune is dependent on divine revelation, and so too is theological reflection on the triune God. The two, it is true, advance the claim about the need for revelation in somewhat different terms. In Aquinas, the insistence on divine revelation meshes nicely with his basic epistemology ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.1, aa.1, 9, 10; qq.12–13; q.32, a.1). In this Page 2 of 15</p>

<p class="calibre1">life, knowledge must originate in the senses, and one will be able to come to know what is accessible from that starting point. And so one can come to know that God exists and that God must differ from creatures, not subject to creaturely limitations and pos <b class="calibre3">(p. 184) </b>sessing all perfections in a supereminent way. But what God is in Godself, and in particular that God is triune, transcends the human capacity for knowing. Thus, knowing God is dependent on God's initiative, on God revealing God to human beings, which God does through Scripture. Without that revelation, humans in this life would not know who God is and what God does for them and what God seeks of them, as they move through their affections and acts to God as their God-given end. Bonaventure takes a different tack in arguing the indispensability of divine revelation, invoking the history of salvation as marked by human need, due to sin, and God's redemptive activity ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> q.1, a.2  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.). As made by God, the world does offer testimony to the God that is triune; the world proclaims God in the ways determined by God in God's creative activity. The triune God can be read in the ‘Book’ of creation. But the intellect has been clouded by sin, and human beings as under sin consequently fail to read this Book correctly; they are thus blind to the witness to the triune God provided by the creation. Thus, for humans to know the triune God, other ‘Books’ are required. There is the Book of Scripture, which testifies to God. The Old Testament is concerned with being and unity; but there are figures of the triune God even in the Old. The New Testament more openly proclaims the triune God; here, God reveals God, in the process making it possible to read anew the Book of creation correctly. Yet, for the grasping of the scriptural message about God, and so too the correct reading of the world, a further Book is needed, the Book of Life, which is God's inner inspiration by which people are granted faith, and so accept God's self-manifestation in Scripture. Bonaventure is less interested than Aquinas in the epistemological need for divine revelation, but would seem to have room for that: his God, after all, is transcendent mystery, and while there are lesser and better ways of putting the triune God, ultimately this God transcends the ability of reason to fully grasp, in this life. But, in Bonaventure, it is the moral need that comes to the fore: God's revelation of God, and providing of aid in the Book of Life, aims at change in the person, to facilitate the attainment of the end—God—that has been set for people by God. Coming to affirm the triune God, and seeing in reality that God, are essential to the journey to God, which comes to its term in the next life. Correspondingly, to ‘see’ God through and in the world or the self requires the proper spiritual disposition, fostered in prayer and humble desire, on the part of the journeyer, a point nicely made in the Prologue to his great spiritual writing, the  <i class="calibre4">Itinerarium</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God's initiative makes possible the salvific movement to God as end. This initiative likewise for both theologians sets the stage, is the condition, for theological work, not least the discussion of the triune God. Theirs is a tradition-based and tradition-guided enquiry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, there are some differences between the two in the understanding of theology. Thirteenth-century Franciscans tend to conceive of theology in primarily practical terms. Just as is Scripture, so the theology made possible by Scripture aims at moral transformation, the furtherance of the movement of the person to God as end. Aquinas for his part thinks that just as sacred doctrine—the body of truths revealed by God that are necessary for Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">salvation—is both practical and speculative ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.1, a.4), so too is the theology that pertains to it. By accepting in faith the God who is both beginning and end, and thinking correctly of that God, one will be led to action that is desired by God  <b class="calibre3">(p. 185) </b>and conducive to reaching the end that is God. Theology thus is practical. But it is also speculative, mirroring the knowing that God has of God and that is the root of sacred doctrine, and anticipating that knowing, now held by the blessed ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.1, a.2,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.), that will be granted at the term of the journey, in the next life. Yet, despite such difference in characterizing the point of theology, for both Bonaventure and Aquinas, theology remains ‘faith seeking understanding’. Through one's theological meditation and argument, one is seeking a firmer understanding of truths that are crucial to one's being and operation. For that seeking, there must be a faith, in objective terms; and the truths of faith are revealed by God, in Scripture. Scriptural revelation is the foundation of all theological work, and, in ways appropriate to their different writings, Scripture will provide the touchstone. In addressing the scriptural witness, neither theologian is on his own. In his reading and rendering of the scriptural witness, each is aided by those who have come before: the Church, in its conciliar determinations; the doctors or Fathers of the Church, whose skill in interpreting and exploring and defending God's revelation has been acknowledged by the believing community; other theologians, including more recent theologians, who aspire to grasp and transmit saving truth; the philosophers, whose principal occupation lies elsewhere than sacred doctrine and theology, but whose insights and analyses may be useful, when appropriated and adapted by the theologian, in proclaiming and clarifying and defending Christian truth ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.1, a.8, ad2;  <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, Prologue; Part One, chs. 1–2). As it happens, Aquinas and Bonaventure tend to favour different theologians and parts of the tradition in their particular Trinitarian discussions. But, for both, doing theology is a communal affair, and their theologies are possible only by virtue of Scripture and the mediating tradition. In discussing the triune God, they each are trying to do justice to what God has revealed about God, to what the Church has proclaimed through the centuries about the three-personed God. The ancient faith of the Church was known in the thirteenth century, and was still vibrant, and cherished. That faith, as delineated in the formative centuries of the Christian movement, and nicely restated more recently, at Lateran IV (1215), acknowledges both unity and substantial identity, and personal distinction and proper qualities (Tanner 1990: 230); one without the other will distort the reality that is the Christian God. Both Aquinas and Bonaventure strive mightily, each in his own way, to offer balanced accounts of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bonaventure</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bonaventure offers extended discussions of the triune God in several of his writings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the chief discussions are the  <i class="calibre4">Commentary</i> on the first book of the Lombard's  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i>; the disputed questions on the Trinity (1255); the  <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, Part One, chs. 2–6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(1257); and the  <i class="calibre4">Itinerarium</i>, ch. 6 (1259). The  <i class="calibre4">Commentary</i> on the  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> follows the Lombard's order and contains (in I, dist. 2–34) a detailed presentation on Trinity, articulating Bonaventure's most typical insights. There are eight disputed questions on  <b class="calibre3">(p. 186)</b> the Trinity, looking in turn at divine existence, unity, simplicity, infinity, eternity, im</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 15</p>

<p class="calibre1">mutability, necessity, and primacy. Each of the first seven questions falls into two articles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a first article, he will reflect on an attribute, and in the second, make the appropriate Trinitarian comments, showing the compatibility of a given attribute with Trinity, indeed, its instantiation. The discussion is as a rule sophisticated, and more nuanced and advanced than that found in the  <i class="calibre4">Commentary</i> on the  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> or in the  <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, playing up the thorny issues of Trinitarian discourse and for the most part assuming the basics of Trinitarian theology. The  <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i> is meant to be a summary of theology for the benefit of newcomers to the discipline. It treats its topics briskly, in the process hitting on the high notes of theology. In the discussion of Trinity, Bonaventure announces three main questions which he considers in turn: how the unity of the divine substance and nature can coexist with a plurality of persons; how the unity of the divine substance and nature can coexist with a plurality of manifestations; how the unity of the divine substance and nature can coexist with a plurality of appropriations. In treating the first of these questions (Part One, chs. 2–4), Bonaventure introduces the most important Trinitarian terminology (emanations; hypostases; relations; characteristics or notions; personal properties) and, in reviewing basic rules of predication when it comes to God, is attentive to the need for precision in stating the triune God. In the  <i class="calibre4">Itinerarium</i>, the discussion of Trinity, scattered throughout the work, is most intense in the sixth chapter. In the fifth, he has reflected on the name of God, Being, revealed in the Old Testament. In the sixth, he turns to that, Good, revealed in the New Testament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Good is central to Bonaventure's discussion of the triune God. Bonaventure invokes the Good in treating God's activities  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>. Echoing Pseudo-Dionysius (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">De caelestia</i> <i class="calibre4">hierarchia</i>, ch. 4;  <i class="calibre4">De divinis nominibus</i>, ch. 4), Bonaventure notes that it pertains to the good to diffuse itself, to share its goodness or perfection with others. Hence, in creating, in bringing into existence and sustaining what is not God, God is sharing with creatures God's goodness. God is free of any necessity to create; God would be God even if there were no universe of creatures. But, as good, indeed the ultimate goodness, it is wholly in keeping with, compatible with, God's nature to bring others into existence. Thus, God creates, in a voluntary, non-necessitated act. That God is good also shapes the treatment of salvation, and of the incarnation that facilitates the attainment of God's salvific end for human beings. God wills to share the good that is God with those who are not God. God has set God as the end of human existence. God offers, as the end of human beings, the possibility of full communion with God, of coming to know and love, directly, the good that is God. And, to make reaching that end possible, God gives of Godself, entering into the world and taking up all that pertains to human being into a union that is personal and hypostatic. Again, there is no necessity for God to save or to become incarnate; but such are reflective of God's goodness. For Bonaventure, as for other medieval theologians (including Aquinas), there is an intimate link between goodness and love. Loving is the highest form of good and is a sharing of goodness. And so creating and saving and becoming incarnate all testify to God's love for what is not God. In the way appropriate to each of these activities, God shows God's love, because God is good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 187) </b>The account of the inner life of the Trinity too revolves around love and the good (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 2, a.unicus, q.4, conclusion;  <i class="calibre4">Itinerarium</i> 6.2). Several basic features of love are pertinent to the presentation of the triune God. Love is not self-contained; it has to do with another. To love is to give of oneself, to another. It is to share oneself with that other. Love is also mutual: it involves the love of that other in return. And true love involves more than the two; it will bring in a third, who is loved by the two. The two in their perfect love share themselves with a third, who so unites them fully. With respect to God, the relations that are constitutive of the divine persons are figured in terms of love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Father's loving self-giving, the Son is generated; the Son loves the Father in return; and in the perfection of their mutual love, there is a third, the Holy Spirit, with whom they share themselves, in their love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origin is important in this meditation on the divine persons. The Son is generated by the Father, arises from the Father. The Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, receiving from both. The Father, however, is innascible, does not arise from another; the Father is of himself. On this basis, the Father enjoys a fundamental primacy (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">In I</i> <i class="calibre4">Sent</i>., dist. 27, pars 1, a.unicus, q.2, ad3; dist. 28, a.unicus, qq.1–4;  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> q.8, conclusion;  <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, Part One, ch. 3, 7). Now, from Aristotle ( <i class="calibre4">Posterior Analytics</i> I, ch. 2) and the  <i class="calibre4">Liber de causis</i>, we know that what is more prior is more productive of being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, to the ‘negative’ aspect of the Father (namely, the Father does not arise from another) Bonaventure adds the more positive description, that the Father possesses a fontal plenitude. It is out of this fullness that the Father generates the Son; that the Father does so is fully in keeping with the Father's underived goodness; this generating is for such a one necessary. There are different sorts of emanation, as, again, Aristotle reminds us ( <i class="calibre4">Metaphysics</i> 6.22). This emanation can be termed in the manner of nature ( <i class="calibre4">per modum</i> <i class="calibre4">naturae</i>), in the Father's full communication of what belongs to the Father to the Son, in generation. Another emanation is found in the spiration of the Holy Spirit. This is  <i class="calibre4">per</i> <i class="calibre4">modum voluntatis</i>, and is a matter of liberality, more of the will (with the nature accompanying) ( <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, Part One, ch. 3, 2;  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 2, a.unicus, q.4, conclusion; dist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">10, a.1, qq.1–3). In their mutual love, Father and Son bring to be the third that is the Holy Spirit, sharing themselves with this shared term of their love. The Son is the beloved of the Father, the Holy Spirit the co-beloved of the Father and the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his discussion of the emanations and relations, Bonaventure is attentive to the attributes of divinity. Perfection, eternity, unity, and simplicity might be mentioned here. God is utterly perfect, and eternally so. And thus there is no discursiveness in God, and God is not subject to time. Emanation is an eternal act, and there is no ‘time’ when the Son, who is generated by the Father, is not. Nor can that act be distinguished into constituent parts, falling into some sort of sequence. So too of the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son in their mutual loving; the Spirit eternally is, as are the Father and the Son. The communication in each of these emanations is total; all that belongs to God the Father in the Father's divinity is given, without loss to the Father, to the Son who is generated; all that pertains to the first two persons as divine is communicated to the Holy Spirit. The three persons are coeternal and equal (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. <b class="calibre3">(p. 188) </b>19). God's perfection might also be cited to explain why there are only the two eternal emanations in Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">God. To posit others would be superfluous, and even impious; generating the Son, the Father communicates to the Son all that the Father is, and there is no need for further, additional emanation of this sort. So too the spiration by the Father and the Son of the Holy Spirit is complete, fully constitutive of this divine person; there is no need for another spirit. God is also one and simple. In generating the Son in the self-giving love that expresses the fecundity of the Father, the Father is not bringing another being into existence. The Son eternally is; and is of the same being, and substance, as the Father. There are differences in God, marked by talk of persons, but these differences are not absolute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Father is not the Son; but they, and the Holy Spirit, are the same God. The three persons, different from each other but always in fundamental relation, are each identical with one and the same divine essence. What is generated, what proceeds, does not go </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘outside’ of God but each stands in eternal relation to its Principle. What emanates is intrinsic and immanent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through his careful rendering of the divine emanations in terms appropriate to God, Bonaventure is able to allege the parallel between the inner life of the triune God and God's work  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>, without confusing the two. In both, love and good predominate; and God's work in the creation mirrors and is rooted in the inner dynamic of the triune God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God's communication of good to creatures echoes, in accordance with God's creative plan, the eternal generation and spiration; this is why creaturely effects can act sacramentally, pointing beyond themselves to, and so proclaiming, the triune God who is their source and end. But divine emanation is not a creative act. God brings creatures into existence and sustains and guides them by God's will. However much, by the divine intention, creatures look like God, no creature is God; there is always an ontological distance between Creator and creature. The Father is the principle of the Son, but is not the creator of the Son; the Son is not a creature, but is God, one who arises from the Father and who eternally stands in full relation to the Father, who is Father because of the Son. The emanations characteristic of divinity and creation are of fundamentally different orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As testified to by Scripture and the tradition, the second divine person is known by several names proper to this person: Son, Image, Word ( <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, Part One, ch. 3, 8;  <i class="calibre4">In I</i> <i class="calibre4">Sent</i>., dist. 27, pars 2). Each of these names helps to manifest important features of the second person. ‘Son’ underscores that the Father's generating is personal, and that what is generated is of one and the same nature as the Father. ‘Image’ points to the extent of the communicating in this generation. The second person receives, and fully, the divine nature; the second person who is Image also receives from the Father what pertains to the Father as that divine person. While the second person is not innascible, the second divine person does receive from the Father the Father's productive power, such that the second person is principle, with the Father, of the third. The name ‘Word’ has a more intellective flavour. It discloses that this person expresses the Father, what the Father is and knows. And, on that basis, this person also stands as the model or exemplar of the creation, of all that is brought into existence as a mark of God's communication of God's goodness  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>. All things that are made are made according to the second  <b class="calibre3">(p. 189) </b>di</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">vine person, in accordance with God's plan for the wise communication of God's goodness outside of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The third divine person also has several names ( <i class="calibre4">Breviloquium</i>, Part One, ch. 3, 9;  <i class="calibre4">In I</i> <i class="calibre4">Sent</i>., dist. 10, a.2, q.1  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.; dist. 18, a.unicus, q.5, ad4). The Holy Spirit has the personal name of ‘Love’, for the Spirit is produced by the joint loving of the Father and the Son, sharing their love with this third. As such, the Spirit is also ‘Bond’, the eternal, personal result of the loving of these others. And, since that loving reflects the liberality of God, linked to the will of God, the third person is also termed the ‘Gift’, the first of all gifts who as fully God is the basis, and model, for all gifts given to those who are not God. The Spirit, however, is not ‘Image’, as the Son is Image; for the Spirit is eternally produced by a joint activity, not by the Father alone. And so the Holy Spirit lacks the generative power that the Father eternally communicates with the Son. The Spirit is in this sense purely receptive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bonaventure's description of the primacy of the Father is perhaps his most innovative Trinitarian move. It also occasioned some controversy. Why is the first divine person the Father? Here, paternity, the personal characteristic of the Father, is surely relevant. The Father is the Father because of generation. But Bonaventure also observes the fontal plenitude of the Father, which pertains to the Father as first; and this seems, logically, to be prior to, apart from, generating. It is because of this primal fullness, as unoriginated, that this person can/must generate. Relation, then, would only provide a partial account for the person. The first person would be Father in a lesser sense (due to the primal fullness), and then logically in a fuller sense, because of generation (Hayes 1979: 42; Friedman 2010: 28–30). The richness of Bonaventure's talk of the primacy of the Father in terms of plenitude might be offset by this relativization of paternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bonaventure drew on several different sources in constructing this imposing Trinitarian theology (Hayes 1979: 13–24; Calisi 2008: 27–34). The twelfth-century theologian Richard of St Victor, in his  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> 3, had anticipated him in rooting the discussion of Trinitarian relations and the divine persons in an analysis of love and its modes; so too Richard shared with Bonaventure the affirmation, on this basis, of necessity, that a plurality of divine persons is necessary, and precisely three divine persons. Richard too had linked love and the good, but did not invoke the Pseudo-Dionysian ‘good as self-diffusive’ in explicating the triune God. That move was made subsequently, by Bonaventure's Franciscan predecessors, by Alexander of Hales in his  <i class="calibre4">Gloss</i> on the  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> and in the collaborative <i class="calibre4">Summa fratris Alexandri</i> (Hayes 1979: 20; 21–2). The  <i class="calibre4">Summa fratris Alexandri</i> also anticipated Bonaventure in his use of the two kinds of emanation ( <i class="calibre4">per modum naturae</i>;  <i class="calibre4">per</i> <i class="calibre4">modum liberalitatis</i> and will) to distinguish Son and Spirit (Mathieu 1992: 28–34). Philosophy too has made its contribution. The insight that what is more prior is more fecund goes back to Aristotle, and more clearly to the  <i class="calibre4">Liber de causis</i> (propositions 1, 17); so too the identification of kinds of emanation has an Aristotelian inspiration. Yet, while the significant features of this theology have important antecedents and the teaching is ‘Franciscan’, there is a scholarly consensus that Bonaventure marks an advance on what has been Page 8 of 15</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas discusses the Trinity at length in several of his writings. He devotes considerable space in the systematic writings to an  <i class="calibre4">ex professo</i> account of Trinity. Thus, he addresses Trinity in the first book of his  <i class="calibre4">Commentary</i> on the  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard, which he prepared as a student at the University of Paris, making use of the commentaries of Albert the Great and of Bonaventure and, among other things, suggesting how the acts of God  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> are patterned on the inner activities of Trinity (Emery 1995); in the final book of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i>; and in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae, Prima Pars</i>. He also treats Trinity at length in writings of other genres; these writings can nicely complement what is found in the systematic writings. Thus, for example, there is a series of questions devoted to Trinity in the disputed questions  <i class="calibre4">De Potentia</i> (roughly contemporary with the <i class="calibre4">Prima Pars</i> of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa</i>); and Aquinas offers a rich teaching in his great  <i class="calibre4">Commentary</i> on John. In what follows, the focus is on the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> and  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> ). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Granted the scholarly debate about occasion and genre, the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> is best characterized as a work in Christian wisdom (Gauthier 1993). As suggested by the opening citation of Prov. 8:7 (‘my mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate impiety’), the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> reviews the main truths of the Christian faith, exploring their meaning and coherence, while also distinguishing these truths from other versions of wisdom. An alternative title for the entire work helps to convey the double movement of the work, to proclaim and defend:  <i class="calibre4">Liber de veritate catholicae fidei contra errores infidelium</i>. ‘Unbelief’ can take different expressions, and so those against whom Aquinas argues while teaching Christian wisdom will differ from case to case: at times philosophers, who have fallen short in this regard or that of some aspect of the faith, at others, heretics who share some but not all of the orthodox faith. Aquinas organizes the four books of the <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> according to the distinction between the articles and the preambles of faith ( <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> I, chs. 1–9). Both are revealed by God and are tied to salvation; the articles transcend reason and must be held by faith; the preambles are open to demonstration, but are revealed since they can be attained by argument only after a long time, and only by a few, and then with error admixed in. While the articles cannot be demonstrated, they are not contrary to reason (although above it), and one can think about them, plumb their meaning, and try to obtain a greater sense of them. The first three books are devoted to the preambles; the final to the articles, covering Trinity, incarnation, sacraments, and the end things. The doctrine of God, consequently, is distributed across several books: that God exists and what God is/is not is found in book one; God's creative and providential activity are treated in the second and third books; the Trinity, with the continuation of the discussion  <b class="calibre3">(p. 191) </b>in the account of Christ, is examined in the fourth. Each successive part of the discussion of God presupposes what has Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">come before, while contributing to the overall doctrine. It is the same God, the Christian God, who is discussed throughout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas discusses Trinity in Bk. IV, chs. 2–26 (chs. 27–55 look at the incarnation of the second divine person and its salvific payoff). The Trinitarian chapters fall into two main parts: chs. 2–14 are on the second divine person, chs. 15–25 on the Holy Spirit (ch. 26 offers a fine summary of Christian teaching, affirming the three persons who are equal in their divinity, rehearsing more methodically the technical language of procession and relation and notion that has been employed at points in the preceding chapters). The discussion of the second person itself falls into two sections, each prosecuting particular tasks of a Trinitarian theology. Chs. 2–9 revolve around the scriptural evidence, taking into account divergent readings of Scripture, offered by certain heretics (Photinus, Sabellius, the Arians). Scripture proclaims a generation in God and insists that what is generated is truly God. The heretics have failed to read Scripture correctly: Sabellius denies distinction in God and thinks that the names of ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ simply mark different moments in the activities of an, in effect, one-personed God; the Arians grant distinction, but equate the difference between Father and Son to that in effect between the creator God and creatures. The virtue of the orthodox formulation (the one God who is distinct in persons) is brought into relief by showing how the different heresies fail in their reading of Scripture. Chs. 10–14 approach the second person in relation to the first from a different angle. Ch. 10 raises objections to the orthodox teaching: even if it fairly renders Scripture, there are profound difficulties with that teaching; the objections reported in ch. 10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">would seem to be insinuating the rational appeal of the heresies previously treated (even if they are defective readings of Scripture, don’t they nonetheless make more sense than the orthodox teaching?). Aquinas will answer these objections, and in the process make the orthodox case, in ch. 14. In the intervening chapters (11–13) he sets up that final chapter, showing the plausibility of what orthodox Christians, on the basis of Scripture as read and determined by the Church, proclaim about God. How is generation in God to be taken (ch. 11)? After considering different types of generation, Aquinas identifies the most suitable parallel as found in intellectual generation, and in particular, in one's thinking of oneself, in which one forms a ‘word’ of oneself. He then painstakingly suggests how this would play out in God, taking into account the analyses offered in the first book. All perfections are to be affirmed of God; they are to be affirmed of God in a way proper to God; all imperfections, found in creatures, are to be denied of God. There is, in short, a grammar of divinity; and in the Trinitarian discussions, Aquinas observes that grammar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The upshot is that intellectual generation in God, by which the one spoken is distinguished from the one who speaks, is portrayed as a single, eternal act, in which the Word who is spoken possesses real being and indeed the same being as the Father. The Word is different from the Father, but does not proceed outside of God; the two stand in real relation, and the being of the two is the same. Each is identical with the divine essence, while different from each other. The relations constitutive of Father and second person, on the basis of the eternal intellectual generation, are subsistent. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 192) </b>With the tradition, Aquinas knows of different names proper to the second person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier in his career, he had tended to prefer that of ‘Son’, which nicely conveys personhood as well as identity in nature. By the time of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i>, he tends to play up that of ‘Word’, as this chapter underscores, corresponding to the manner of generation by which the second person eternally is (Paissac 1951). He can also employ the name ‘Image’ with facility: since God's knowing of God is perfect, the Word who is eternally formed by the Father is a perfect representation of the Father, the Image of the Father. The Word manifests the Father and can reveal the Father to others. And the Word of the Father is thus, in a distinctive way, the Wisdom of God; Aquinas will exploit this in his account of creation, as well as in a subsequent discussion of the fittingness of this divine person becoming incarnate for the purpose of human salvation ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> IV, chs. 12 and 42) (Wawrykow 1998). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the subsequent presentation of the third person, Aquinas is again intent on stating orthodox teaching succinctly and in linking that formulation to the scriptural witness. The Holy Spirit is distinct in person and one in being and substance with the Father and the Word; this is what Scripture affirms. Heresy (in particular, that that denies fully divinity to the Spirit) is invoked, to make clearer orthodox teaching by contrast, and rebutted, as a faulty reading of Scripture. Aquinas devotes considerable effort to the scriptural presentation of the activities of the Spirit, to gird the case for full divinity. He also brings in the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, which with Bonaventure he affirms, although in different terms ( <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> IV, chs. 24 and 25; Emery 1996). He alleges several reasons for saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both persons, is spirated by Father and the Word, including the need to distinguish between the second and third persons. Given the identity of intellect and will in God, if the Spirit proceeded from the Father alone, then there would be no reason not to term this person a Son; yet there is only one Son. Both Father and Son are involved in spiration, in the love of God's goodness that eternally gives rise to the Spirit; and there is a logical priority of the Word's generation. Love proceeds from a word; humans are able to love nothing but that which a word of the heart conceives ( <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> IV.24.12); the same holds in God. In teaching  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, Aquinas asserts a continuity with the fourth and fifth ecumenical councils, as well as with the great doctors of the faith, both east and west ( <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> IV.24.5–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While presenting materially the same teaching, the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> differs from the <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> in several respects. First, Aquinas no longer uses the preambles of faith-articles of faith distinction to structure the entire work. Thus, what is distributed over several books in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> is now found in the Prima Pars of the <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i>: the unity and essence of God; the Trinity of persons; the creative activity of the triune God. Second, Scripture figures differently in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas is still dependent on scriptural revelation: apart from God's self-disclosure, one would not know that God is triune. But Aquinas is not intent in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> to show how dogmatic formulation is rooted in Scripture; that task of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra</i> <i class="calibre4">Gentiles</i> (as in Bk. IV, chs. 2–9) is here taken as given. A third difference comes in the depth and extent of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa's</i> analysis. The  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i> is much more <b class="calibre3">(p. 193) </b>limited in scope, keeping to what is basic in the presentation of Christian truth, Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">including Trinity. In its discussion, the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> goes into much greater detail and the process is meticulous and precise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In treating what belongs to the Trinity of persons in God, Aquinas follows what he deems the order of doctrine, beginning with the processions (q.27) and then relations (q.28) and then person (qq.29ff.); this is to reverse the order of knowing, in which person is revealed first, but is in keeping with the pedagogical aim of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i>, as announced in its brief Prologue. The discussion of person falls into two main sections, as suggested by the transitional paragraph at the head of q.29: Aquinas first considers the persons absolutely, and then in comparative terms. In terms of the first section (qq.29–38), the general consideration of the persons involves four points: the meaning of the word </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’ (q.29); the number of the persons (q.30); what is involved in the number of the persons or is opposed thereto, as diversity and similitude and the like (q.31); and what belongs to the knowledge of the persons (q.32). A series of questions is then devoted to the persons singly: to the Father (q.33); to the second person, who is Son, Word (q.34) and Image (q.35); to the third, who is called Holy Spirit (q.36), Love (q.37), and Gift (q. </p>
<p class="calibre1">38). In the second main section devoted to the persons (qq.39–43), Aquinas looks at what concerns the person in relation to the essence (q.39), to the properties (q.40) and notional acts (q.41), and then as compared to one another, first with regard to equality and likeness (q.42) and then with regard to mission (q.42). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opening questions (27 to 29), on procession, relation, and person, are foundational, setting the tone for the rest of the discussion of Trinity. One begins with these since the divine persons are distinguished from each other according to the relations of origin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Questions 27 to 29 are brisk and adept. There are two eternal processions in God: the intellectual generation of the Word, and the procession which is the spiration of the Holy Spirit. The relations (paternity, sonship, spiration, and procession) are real, and distinguish the persons. But, as is proper to God, they are identical with the divine essence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This allows Aquinas to portray correctly ‘person’ as used of God. As Boethius says, ‘person’ is an individual substance of a rational nature. In God, relations are constitutive of the persons. While in creatures relation is an accident, in God relation is taken substantially. In God, there is no real distinction between essence and  <i class="calibre4">esse</i> ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.3, a.4); and since the relations are identical with the divine essence, their being is not accidental. In God, person denotes subsistent relation ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.29, a.4,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.). Previous questions in the treatise on God, dealing with what is common in the Christian God, have prepared well for the discussion of divine persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Organization is indeed Aquinas’ forte, and he has constructed a teaching on God that is comprehensive and precise, leading to fresh insight into the Christian God, in the service of Christian faith. While sharing much with Bonaventure's theology—the basic terminology of Trinitarian discourse, as this had emerged over the centuries; the linking of the immanent and the economic Trinity; the stressing of God's salvific intention as the beginning and end of reflecting on Trinity—Aquinas’ account of the Christian God  <b class="calibre3">(p. 194) </b>takes a distinctive shape. The pace is measured as he unfolds that teaching, moving from what the persons hold in common, to the persons themselves, including in their individuality, to Page 12 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a><b class="calibre3">Franciscan and Dominican Trinitarian Theology (Thirteenth Century):</b> <b class="calibre3">Bonaventure and Aquinas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">the creative and salvific activities of the triune God in the world. Aquinas favours, as well, different authorities; as in the discussion of the processions in terms of rational activities, the debt to Augustine is more pronounced and obvious. Aquinas has, finally, shied away from what is likely the most distinctive feature of Bonaventure's Trinitarian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without naming Bonaventure, Aquinas rejects the parsing of innascibility in terms of fecundity; for him, innascibility simply means that the Father is not from another ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q. </p>
<p class="calibre1">33, 4, ad1). And although Aquinas certainly invokes the Dionysian insight into the self-diffuseness of the good when it comes to the action of God  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>—witness his argument for the plausibility of the second person becoming incarnate ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.1, a.1,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.)—he does not use that saying to portray the inner life of the Trinity, preferring to base the distinction of the persons who are God exclusively in subsistent relations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">IN the present chapter my purpose is to give an overview of aspects of the Trinitarian discussion from around 1250 until around 1500, outlining some of the major positions and identifying their most important adherents, and indicating how the discussion changed over time. In the process, I hope to give an impression of the richness of later-medieval Trinitarian theology, as well as of the argumentative and systematic rigor with which theologians from the period approached the subject. The chapter is arranged in four parts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first part describes two distinct ways in the late thirteenth century of talking about the constitution of the divine persons, one based on relations, the other on emanations; the second part focuses on some of John Duns Scotus’ contributions; the third sketches two important fourteenth-century developments, Praepositinianism (the denial that the Trinitarian mystery can be  <i class="calibre4">explained</i> in any significant sense), and innovations in Trinitarian logic; the fourth part looks briefly at the still mostly uninvestigated fifteenth-century Trinitarian theology. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Late Thirteenth-century Trinitarian Theology</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For the university-trained theologians throughout our entire period, the central fact in Trinitarian theology, given by the faith and confirmed by Church councils from Nicaea to Lateran IV, was that God is three and one. There are three persons, really distinct among themselves, yet truly identical in the one, common divine essence. All our theologians <b class="calibre3">(p. 198) </b>could agree on this. Nearly every other issue was up for discussion. For example, by far the most common view among our theologians was that each divine person was constituted, i.e. took on his own personal being, on account of a characteristic known as a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘personal property’ that is unique to that one person and makes that person distinct from the other two. On this view, then, the three divine persons share everything—they are ‘essentially identical’—apart from each their own personal property bringing about the real distinction between the persons. We will see below (§3) that in the fourteenth century several theologians rejected the whole idea of personal properties and personal constitution. But already in the thirteenth century, one of the most heavily disputed questions concerned the nature of the personal properties: are they  <i class="calibre4">relations</i> or are they  <i class="calibre4">emanations</i>? In brief, a group of primarily Dominican theologians, following Thomas Aquinas on this issue, claimed that the personal properties are relations, whereas another group, mostly composed of Franciscans, developed in the course of the later thirteenth century an explanation of the Trinitarian mystery focusing on emanations. These views were grounded in quite divergent ways of thinking about the constitution of the divine persons, and hence in two very distinct approaches to Trinitarian theology. (On late thirteenth-century Trinitarian theology, see Friedman 2010: 5–75; Friedman forthcoming: chs. 1–5). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relation account of divine personal distinction claims that, for example, the Father and the Son are personally distinct since a Father is only a Father because he has (in this case) a Son. If the relations between them are real and not mere mental constructs, then Father and Son must be distinct in some way—not distinct essentially (since they share everything else and are one God) but distinct as persons. During our period, defenders of the relation account of personal distinction laid a stress upon the fact that not only are these relations that constitute the persons real, they are also  <i class="calibre4">opposed</i>. Thus, it is because paternity and filiation are opposed to each other that they are the constituting properties of Father and Son;  <i class="calibre4">mutatis mutandis</i> the same is true concerning passive spiration's being the constitutive property of the Holy Spirit, although active spiration does not constitute a person in its own right since it is shared by the Father and the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emanation account takes a different point of departure. ‘Emanation’ is the term the medieval scholastics used to describe how the divine persons are put into being or originated. On the emanation account of the distinction of the persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the very same divine essence in three irreducibly distinct ways, the way that each one emanates or originates. Thus, the Father is the divine essence in a fundamentally different way than the Son is, and the Holy Spirit is the very same divine essence in a third totally different way, these three different ways being how each one originates or has being. Specifically, the Father has the divine essence from no other (the Father is unemanated), the Son has the divine essence naturally by the emanation Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">‘generation’ (the Son is emanated by way of nature), and the Holy Spirit has the divine essence voluntarily by the emanation ‘spiration’ (the Holy Spirit is emanated by way of will). Thus, three irreducibly distinct emanational properties account for the fact that the three divine persons are emanationally distinct, yet essentially identical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After around 1250 theologians began to consider these two Trinitarian explanations to be mutually exclusive, such that holding one of them more or less ruled out holding  <b class="calibre3">(p. 199)</b> the other. Thus, after around 1250 one can trace the development of two mutually opposed complexes of Trinitarian positions—what I call Trinitarian traditions: one centring on relations, the other on emanations. As mentioned, one tradition was predominantly Dominican in composition and, following Thomas Aquinas, adopted the relation account to explain the distinction of the persons and played down the significance of the emanations. A predominantly Franciscan tradition, on the other hand, championed the emanation account, and viewed the relations as being of lesser importance. It was in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century that these two Trinitarian traditions stabilized—and this is visible in the works of such Franciscan theologians as John Pecham (d. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1292), William de la Mare (d. after 1282), Matthew of Aquasparta (d. 1302), Roger Marston (d. 1303?), and William of Ware (fl.  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1300), as well as in the works of Dominicans and those who follow a basically Dominican line, from major figures of the late thirteenth century like Giles of Rome (d. 1316), Thomas of Sutton (d. after 1315), and Godfrey of Fontaines (d. 1307?), to such diverse early fourteenth-century theologians as Hervaeus Natalis (d. 1323), Durand of St Pourçain (d. 1334), and John of Naples (d.  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1350). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the two Trinitarian traditions, the Dominican and the Franciscan, gradually coalesced in the later thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the particular differences between the emanation account and the relation account came to the fore in several ‘flashpoints’, loci in the Trinitarian debate where an emanational conception of the personal properties and a relational one were fundamentally at odds. Specifically, these flashpoints arose because on the Dominican interpretation of the relation account the persons are constituted in opposed pairs (Father in opposition to Son, Father and Son in opposition to Holy Spirit), whereas on the Franciscan interpretation of the emanation account persons are (or at least could be) constituted singly on the basis of their unique emanational property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of these flashpoints had to do with the constitution of the Father. The Franciscans made the claim that the Father's innascibility, the fact that the Father is not from any other (i.e. is unemanated), was the way that he was the divine essence. (To be more precise: as most of the later-medieval theologians in the Franciscan Trinitarian tradition recognized, it is most proper to speak of the  <i class="calibre4">first person</i> being constituted by innascibility, since a Father is a Father on the basis of having a Son through generation.) Innascibility thus played a crucial role in Franciscan Trinitarian theology, being an indispensable factor in the Father's constitution. Innascibility did not play so crucial a role in Dominican Trinitarian thought: for the Dominicans, the Father and the Son only have being in relation to each other; it is precisely because the Father has a Son and the Son has a Father Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">that they are distinct from each other. Thus, the Dominicans held that innascibility played basically no role in the constitution of the Father as a person distinct from the other two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A second flashpoint in the later-medieval Trinitarian debate was over the Son's role in the spiration of the Holy Spirit. The issue is as follows: would the Son and the Holy Spirit be distinct if they each emanated from the Father alone, as the Franciscans maintained; or are the Son and the Holy Spirit distinct only if the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son <b class="calibre3">(p. 200) </b>and the Father together, so that there are opposed relations between the Son and the Holy Spirit, as the Dominicans held? Since, for the Franciscans, the  <i class="calibre4">way</i> in which each person took being is the distinctive property of that person, on the Franciscan view whether the Holy Spirit emanates from the Son or not, the Holy Spirit could still be distinct from the Son, because they each could emanate in different ways from the Father alone. This is only to say that each of the three divine properties is irreducibly distinct from the other two on its own account. The Dominicans rejected this entirely. For the Dominicans, only the Holy Spirit's emanating from the Son (and the Father), and hence the existence of directly opposed relations between them, could explain their distinction. Of course, the Franciscans were well aware that one of the issues that stood between the Roman Catholic and the Greek Orthodox churches was the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> clause, the Greeks contending that the Holy Spirit in fact does not proceed from the Son; hence the Franciscans were always careful to stress that the question of the Holy Spirit's not proceeding from the Son was a purely counterfactual one and that the Holy Spirit does in fact proceed from both Father and Son (on this flashpoint, see Bruce Marshall's chapter in the present volume). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A special position in the early Franciscan Trinitarian tradition was held by Henry of Ghent (d. 1293). Henry was not a Franciscan—he was unaffiliated with a religious order—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but his Trinitarian theology can only be understood as part of the Franciscan Trinitarian current. For instance, Henry stresses that innascibility is a crucial factor in the Father's constitution. Further, he maintains that the Holy Spirit would be distinct from the Son, even if the Holy Spirit did not proceed from the Son, since they would be distinct on the basis of their disparate ways of emanating from the Father. In general, Henry stresses the emanational character of the properties constitutive of the persons and de-emphasizes the relational aspects. While supporting these typically Franciscan views, Henry also injects a new element into Franciscan Trinitarian theology: he claims that the emanation of the Son is the emanation of a mental word ( <i class="calibre4">verbum</i>) or concept from the paternal intellect, and that the emanation of the Holy Spirit is the emanation of zeal ( <i class="calibre4">zelus</i>) from the will of the Father and the Son. In this way, Henry moves Augustine of Hippo's psychological model of the Trinity into the heart of his Trinitarian theology, something that his contemporaries in the Franciscan Trinitarian current had not done. (See, on Henry's Trinitarian thought, Friedman 2010; Friedman forthcoming: esp. ch. 4; Williams 2010.) In his  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>, Augustine had given a clarification of the way that the Son relates to the Father, in his attempt to make sense of the opening of John's Gospel: ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God’. The ‘word’ that John was talking about was a mental concept, according to Augustine, and the relation Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">between the Son and the Father is in some way parallel to the relation between a mental word and the knowledge from which the word comes. Thus, the word is an exact likeness of the prior knowledge, differing only because the word is formed or given birth by the intellect. In just this way the Father and the Son are identical essentially, differing only on account of the Son's generation, his receiving the divine essence from the Father. Augustine extended this ‘psychological model’ to include the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit is spirated as Love. Henry of Ghent overlaid onto the Franciscan tradition's  <b class="calibre3">(p. 201) </b>emanation account of personal distinction the Augustinian psychological model of the Trinity. Capitalizing on the fact that in medieval philosophy the intellect was commonly considered a ‘natural’ faculty (i.e. when presented with an object it necessarily functioned), Henry linked in a stronger and more elaborate way than had been done previously the Son's procession by way of nature with the Word's procession by way of intellect. For Henry, the Father is unemanated, the Son is emanated by way of the divine intellect as a Word or Concept, and the Holy Spirit is emanated by way of the divine will as Zeal. Thus, Henry claimed that it is the very fact that the Son's emanation is an  <i class="calibre4">intellectual</i> emanation that explained why the Son is distinct from both the Father and the Holy Spirit. Likewise with the Holy Spirit's voluntary emanation: this very fact explained why the Holy Spirit is distinct from both the Father and the Son. Henry went on to say that, because the divine attributes of intellect and will are the sources of the divine emanations, it is the merely rational distinction between these attributes that is the ultimate basis for the distinction between the emanations and hence the persons. In general, Henry stressed a tight link between the divine attributes and the divine emanations: the Son's generation is literally an intellectual emanation; the Holy Spirit's emanation is literally an emanation by way of will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry's linking of the emanation account of personal distinction with a rather literal interpretation of the psychological model became a standard part of Franciscan Trinitarian theology beginning in the 1280s, and it remained highly important for some forty years, after which its significance waned, without ever disappearing. Franciscans of the period, then, often strictly identified the Son's emanation as an intellectual emanation of a concept or Word, and the Holy Spirit's emanation as a voluntary emanation of Love. Dominican theologians, on the other hand, from Henry's day and on were highly sceptical of a literal use of the psychological model of the Trinity: the Son is a Word, certainly, but not because he is emanated literally by way of the intellect; the Holy Spirit is Love, but not because he is emanated by the divine will. And this Dominican rejection of Henry's literal acceptance of the psychological model is simply a facet of the more general Dominican stress on relations: for them, Father and Son are constituted in opposition to each other on the basis of the relations paternity and filiation; while the Holy Spirit is constituted in opposition to both Father and Son on the basis of the relations active and passive spiration. In general, the Trinitarian traditions were a fundamental part of the later-medieval Trinitarian discussion. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">John Duns Scotus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the giants of later-medieval theology, Scotus (d. 1308) worked at Oxford and Paris around the turn of the century, leaving behind a tremendous number of theological writings, including a highly coherent and creative reformulation of later thirteenth-century Franciscan Trinitarian theology. It was indeed a  <i class="calibre4">reformulation</i>, since it is rare that Scotus makes a really radical departure from the core ideas of this Franciscan  <b class="calibre3">(p. 202) </b>Trinitarian tradition; with few exceptions his own contribution was a ‘fine-tuning’ of ideas already laid out. After he made them public, Scotus’ ideas on the Trinity became a building block for later thinkers, and in this way his Trinitarian theology functioned as a type of conduit from the late thirteenth-century Franciscan tradition to the broader scholastic Trinitarian discussion of the fourteenth century and beyond (on Scotus’ Trinitarian theology, see Cross 2005; Friedman 2010: 50–115, 141–2; Friedman forthcoming: ch. 6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scotus’ most remarkable addition to the Trinitarian debate was the suggestion of a near total rejection of the relation account. Earlier Franciscans had downplayed the importance of relation in the constitution of the divine persons, but they had always maintained some space in their Trinitarian theories for relation and relational persons. Scotus’ rejection of relation was far more categorical. Although later in his career he backed away from it, early on Scotus suggested that relation played no part at all in the constitution of the persons; the persons were  <i class="calibre4">absolutes</i>, constituted by absolute origin. This view had been defended even before Scotus by, for instance, William of Auvergne (d. 1249) and Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253), as well as by the Franciscan Peter of John Olivi (d. 1298) and the Augustinian Hermit James of Viterbo (d. 1308), but after Scotus suggested it, it became closely associated with his name. Why are the persons not relative? Scotus basically argues that there are insurmountable problems connected with maintaining that the properties constituting the persons are relatives, and given these problems it is better to claim that the properties are absolutes, and more particularly that the properties are the origin of person from person. Scotus employs several lines of argumentation in favour of this view. First, he claims that one thing refers to another  <i class="calibre4">through</i> relation, and therefore without two pre-existing things there is no relation. This is just to say that what refers through relation is at least logically prior to the relation itself; therefore relation cannot constitute the things related. A second argument that Scotus uses is that, given that we know the Son to be generated, then there must be a supposite that generates the Son, and this supposite has to have existence ‘prior’ (logically, not chronologically speaking) to the relation between Father and Son. It is not merely the case that the Father has the Son as a correlative, rather the Father originates or produces the Son, and according to Scotus, if relation were that which constitutes the persons, then there would be no origin of the Son from the Father. Correspondingly, the person who is produced must be produced as an absolute ‘prior’ to his being related to the person producing. Production comes </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘first’, relation ‘follows’. Finally, Scotus has an argument based upon his own view of the metaphysics of relation. For Scotus, relations are things, having quiddities or natures of their own, and thus a divine relation and the absolute divine essence are two different things with two different quiddities; consequently, Scotus contends that, if each divine Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">person included both essence and relation, then each of the persons would be a sort of accidental unity composed of these two quiddities, rather than a per se unity. Scotus makes a great deal of this last point, and it leads him to conclude that what is constitutive of the persons has no quiddity of its own that could cause composition in the persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Scotus hedges his bets in various ways, nevertheless appealing to these and other arguments, he says that the relation account of personal divine distinction involves <b class="calibre3">(p. 203) </b>too many difficulties to be defended. He suggests instead that the persons are absolute, constituted by absolute properties, and he identifies the absolute properties as non-quidditative origin, corresponding, he tells us, to an efficient cause in creatures. To put this in another way, the constitutive or distinguishing feature of each produced person is the very production of that person, and this production has no quiddity or nature of its own (Scotus stresses that the unproduced Father is constituted not by the relative property innascibility but by some absolute property). This plays a role in Scotus’ model of the constitution of the divine persons as the individuation of a particular member of some natural kind. For Scotus, the divine essence is a nature or a quiddity (i.e. a second substance); personal property is the act individuating the person, making this person an individual of the divine nature distinct from the other two persons; and the divine person is first substance or individual supposite. Throughout his Trinitarian theology, Scotus will rely heavily on this distinction between first and second substance: the divine essence is nature or second substance or quiddity, the persons are first substance and are constituted ‘quasi-efficiently’ by non-quidditative absolute origin. Indeed, some of his further arguments for the persons being absolute hinge on this distinction. We know that first substance is most properly substance, and since it does not involve any imperfection it should be posited in God. But the persons would especially be first substance, since they exist per se (i.e. they subsist). Relation, however, could not formally constitute a subsistent thing or first substance. Therefore the persons are constituted by absolutes. Further, second substance indicates the entire quiddity of first substance; but if the quiddity of relation—different from the quiddity of the essence—were involved in the constitution of the persons, then the persons would not solely have the quiddity of essence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One thing that should be noted about Scotus’ ideas on absolute persons is that, although radically stated, they were in line with the Franciscan Trinitarian tradition's emphasis on emanation and origin. In his later works, Scotus retreats from his suggestion concerning the possibility of absolute persons, but he nevertheless maintains that we are in no way able to  <i class="calibre4">demonstrate</i> the persons to be relative (as opposed to absolute): we must take this on faith due to the preponderance of evidence for its truth from Scripture and Church tradition. This appeal to the faith as the only reason to hold the persons to be relative is taken up by several important fourteenth-century authors like Francis of Meyronnes (d. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1328) and William of Ockham (d. 1347). Indeed, the position that the persons are absolutes was not very successful in the period after Scotus: it appears that only the little-known Michael of Massa, OESA (d. 1337), and the Franciscan John of Ripa ( <i class="calibre4">fl</i>. 1358) would make the theory their own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The unmistakable relationship of Scotus’ ideas on absolute persons to earlier Franciscan Trinitarian thought is borne out in many of the other Trinitarian views that Scotus holds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, as seems clear from his suggestion of absolute persons, central to Scotus’ Trinitarian theory is the fact that the productions or emanations are the most basic sources of the distinction between the divine persons. More specifically still, Scotus maintains that the produced persons are distinct because of the  <i class="calibre4">way</i> that they originate, and this is traced back to the distinction between the sources of the emanations, intellect and will, and more particularly to the irreducibly distinct ways that intellect and will  <b class="calibre3">(p. 204) </b>work, naturally and freely, respectively. Thus, the reason that the Son is a person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit is because he emanates naturally by way of intellect and the reason that the Holy Spirit is distinct is because he emanates freely by way of will. In line with all this, Scotus will argue that the Holy Spirit would still be distinct from the Son if the former did not proceed from the latter (on this last issue, see Marshall's chapter in this volume). </p>
<p class="calibre1">With regard to the psychological model of the Trinity, a foundational claim of Scotus’ is that that intellect and will are  <i class="calibre4">formally</i> distinct both from each other and from the divine essence, and in this way they serve as the foundation for the distinction between the emanations and further the persons. Here Scotus appeals to his famous  <i class="calibre4">formal distinction</i> or <i class="calibre4">formal non-identity</i>, a distinction in something prior to any act of the intellect, yet less than a fully real distinction (like that between two human beings). Because he thinks that merely rationally distinct attributes could not suffice to ground the real distinction between the persons, Scotus maintains against Henry of Ghent that the divine attributes must be more than rationally distinct from each other; in fact, according to Scotus, they must be formally distinct from each other in order to explain how they can act as sources of irreducibly distinct emanations: one absolutely undifferentiated essence, according to Scotus, could not produce in two irreducibly distinct ways. Arguing along these lines, Scotus intends to support a strong use of the psychological model of the Trinity: the Son literally is a Word emanated by way of the divine intellect, the Holy Spirit literally is Love emanated by way of the divine will, and this is only possible if intellect is formally distinct from will. Moreover, Scotus spells out in some detail the relationship between the formally distinct essence, intellect, and will in the emanation of the second and third persons, respectively. Thus, in the Son's intellectual emanation, the divine intellect in the Father, with the divine essence present to it as an intelligible object, is a productive source of generated knowledge, i.e. the Word. In the Holy Spirit's voluntary emanation, the divine essence, present as the loved object to the infinite divine will as it is in the Father and Son, is a productive source of infinite and subsistent Love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All in all, John Duns Scotus passed on to the fourteenth century and beyond an extremely detailed and internally consistent Trinitarian theology in which the clear motivation was to explain as much as possible. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Issues in Fourteenth-Century Trinitarian </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Thought</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the fourteenth century there was a lively discussion of Trinitarian theology, and both the Dominican and the Franciscan Trinitarian traditions and their relation and emanation accounts of personal distinction were represented. Indeed, all through the century there were theologians influenced by Scotus’ version of Franciscan Trinitarian <b class="calibre3">(p. 205) </b>theology. Thus, men like Henry of Harclay (d. 1317), William of Alnwick (d. 1333), and Francis of Meyronnes tended to take their starting point in Scotus’ ideas and even words. A similar fourteenth-century phenomenon can be seen with regard to the Trinitarian theology of Thomas Aquinas. This is not to say that the later theologians were slavish imitators of the great masters; indeed, they often developed and modified (and sometimes explicitly rejected) elements in the Trinitarian theologies of the masters. But Scotus and Aquinas, respectively, were central to their theologies. There were also a good number of theologians whose Trinitarian thought is not Scotistic or Thomistic in any significant sense but whose interests and techniques were clearly in continuity with the earlier period. Included in this category were two of the great minds of the Franciscan order, Peter Auriol (d. 1322) and William of Ockham. In the remainder of this section, however, I want to emphasize two major developments that appear to set apart fourteenth-century Trinitarian thought from thirteenth-century: Praepositinianism and developments in Trinitarian logic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several thinkers from the mid-fourteenth century held a view that can be labelled ‘Praepositinianism’, after Praepositinus of Cremona (d. after 1210), whose name was most often associated with the view in later-medieval texts. The view involved two major points: (1) there is nothing more than a grammatical distinction between a divine person and its property, for example between the Father and his paternity, since they are perfectly identical; (2) because there are no properties in any way distinct from the persons, properties cannot be appealed to in explaining the distinction of the persons, and hence the persons are distinct from one another ‘in and of themselves’ (the Latin term is  <i class="calibre4">se ipsis</i>). The view, then, entails the rejection of both the relation and the emanation account of personal distinction, since in order to explain personal constitution both those accounts rely on properties in some sense distinct from the persons. Although there were never many adherents of the view, in the mid fourteenth century they included major theologians like Walter Chatton (d. 1343) and Robert Holcot (d. 1349) at Oxford, and Gregory of Rimini (d. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1358) at Paris. There are two major points to be stressed about fourteenth-century Praepositinianism. First, the main motivation behind it is to maintain the strictest form of divine simplicity possible, such that there could be no hint of any distinction within a divine person. This motivation is made explicit in the arguments most often used in favour of the view, for example, that each divine person must be as simple as the divine essence itself, and therefore subject to no distinction whatsoever; or that, if a person were constituted from common essence and personal property, then the person would not be absolutely simple. The second point to be stressed is that, beyond the two basic claims about person and property being merely grammatically distinct and the persons being distinct in and of Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, as well as arguments against more elaborate Trinitarian theories, Praepositinians largely eschewed Trinitarian explanation, limiting themselves to restating the most indisputable Trinitarian dogma: that the one God is three really distinct persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This comes across most clearly in Praepositinian responses to criticisms of their position developed in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, when basically all theologians, including Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, and William of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 206) </b>Ockham had condemned the view. Thus, one argument against the Praepositinian view relied on the fact that persons and properties do not neatly coincide, e.g. the Father has two properties, paternity and active spiration, while the Father and the Son share the property of active spiration, and hence person and property could not be strictly identical as the Praepositinian view required. Adherents of Praepositinianism rejected this sort of move by denying that there was even a problem: the Father just is paternity and active spiration, the Son just is filiation and active spiration, and Father and Son spirate the Holy Spirit. There is no genuine explanation here, merely the Roman Catholic view of the Trinity placed into a Praepositinian framework. (On later-medieval Praepositinianism, see Friedman 2010: 133–70; Friedman forthcoming: chs. 11 and 12.) No discussion of fourteenth-century Trinitarian theology would be complete without a mention of the innovative developments in Trinitarian logic that took place especially in the first half of the fourteenth century. Although logical issues were important in several loci in the Trinitarian discussion, nevertheless the most interesting developments are found in discussion of the Trinitarian paralogisms, places where reasoning, as represented by Aristotelian logic, seemed simply to conflict with the doctrine of the Trinity. The most famous example of this is the case of the so-called expository syllogism, for example: the Father is this essence; this essence is the Son; therefore the Father is the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Aristotelian logic, this syllogism is valid, that is to say, it should yield a true conclusion. But its conclusion is, according to the Catholic faith, false, since the Father is a different person from the Son. For scholastic theologians, trained from the first in logic, this presented a paramount challenge, because if there was something wrong with Aristotelian logic in this case, the question would have to be asked whether there is a problem with it in all cases, and that question involved implications for the scholastic project in general. There were two basic ways of tackling this issue. The first was to say that Aristotelian logic is in fact universally valid and then to find a reason within Aristotelian logic itself as to why the syllogism does not work in precisely this case; the second was to say that Aristotelian logic is not universally valid, being unable to handle a case like this, and perhaps further to postulate a special non-Aristotelian ‘logic of faith’ to deal with the Trinitarian paralogisms. The second way was not particularly popular in the fourteenth century, although it is found in the  <i class="calibre4">Centiloquium theologicum</i> (previously attributed to William of Ockham but more likely written by the Dominican Arnold of Strelley ( <i class="calibre4">fl</i>. 1325)), and (less clearly) in Robert Holcot's theology. But the first way was a major source of interesting logical innovations, made with an eye towards defusing the Trinitarian paralogisms. John Duns Scotus provided the fourteenth-century starting point. According to Scotus the problem with the syllogism above is that it fails to take into account the formal distinction that obtains between person (or property) and essence. It is true that the di</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a><b class="calibre3">Medieval Trinitarian Theology from the Late Thirteenth to the Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">vine essence is the Father essentially, but there is nevertheless a formal distinction between them—the Father is not purely or absolutely identical with the essence. The same is true of the Son: Son and essence are the same essentially, but there is a formal distinction between them. On account of the formal distinction, then, the syllogism does not conclude, since the ‘fallacy of accident’ arises and blocks the syllogism. Hence, Scotus believed that the formal distinction  <b class="calibre3">(p. 207) </b>safeguarded both the doctrine of the Trinity and Aristotelian syllogistic logic: there was a perfectly good reason that the syllogism did not result in a true conclusion. Although William of Ockham thought Scotus’ formal distinction to be unintelligible, nevertheless he accepted that person and essence are formally distinct precisely because he could see no other way to guarantee the universality of Aristotelian logic. Dissatisfied with this ad hoc solution, thinkers coming after Ockham, like Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Gregory of Rimini, appealed to other Aristotelian logical tools in order to save the universality of syllogistic logic even when dealing with the Trinity. The discussion continued into the later fourteenth century with such scholars as Pierre d’Ailly (d. 1422) and further into the fifteenth. It has been suggested that theologians in Vienna at the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries became convinced that the Jews living in the town would never convert to Christianity precisely because they could see the logical problems raised by the Trinity; thus the Trinitarian paralogisms seem to have had real world consequences. (On logic and the Trinity in the later-medieval period, see Gelber, dissertation, 1974; Shank 1988; Hallamaa 2003; Kärkkäinen 2007: esp. articles by Knuuttila, Maierú, Marshall, and Nielsen.) <b class="calibre3">The Fifteenth Century</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The theology of the fifteenth century is not well researched at present, but already there are some indications of a few major figures and characteristics. A recognized trait of fifteenth-century thought is its tendency to consciously revisit and even defend the thought of earlier masters. One sees this clearly in the Trinitarian theology of several of the century's major figures, for example John Capreolus (d. 1444), who based his  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> commentary on Thomas Aquinas’ own commentary on the same work. Peter of Nugent ( <i class="calibre4">fl</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1403–4) and William of Vorillon (d. 1463) appear to have done something similar with respect to John Duns Scotus’ Trinitarian theology. Finally, Gabriel Biel (d. 1495), best known for having been read by Martin Luther, tells us explicitly that his purpose in his  <i class="calibre4">Collectorium circa quattuor libros Sententiarum</i> is to capture the meaning of Ockham's  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> commentary in abbreviated form. (On Biel, see Friedman 2003.) Finally, one should mention Denys the Carthusian (d. 1472), whose immense  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> commentary presents a spectrum of scholastic figures in discussion with one another on many issues, including the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A second important tendency of the fifteenth century is the differing ways in which both artists and theologians read Aristotle: a nominalist way, harking back to William of Ockham (among others), and a realist way, harking back to Albert the Great (d. 1280), Thomas Aquinas, and John Duns Scotus. The  <i class="calibre4">Wegestreit</i>, or dispute between these ways, became bitter at many fifteenth-century universities, and it influenced Trinitarian theolo</p>

Thus, nominalistic-leaning theologians were more inclined to say that the Trinity was not amenable to Aristotelian analysis, and, even when such analysis was defensible, it was founded on a parsimonious nominalistic understanding of Aristotelian metaphysical <b class="calibre3">(p. 208) </b>categories (e.g. of relation); realists, on the other hand, were more sanguine about the use of Aristotle, and understood Aristotle in a more concrete, realist way (Hoenen forthcoming). The influence of the nominalist/realist divide upon Trinitarian thought is to be seen already in the late fourteenth century with the Trinitarian theology of John Wyclif (d. 1384), a strong realist on the issue of universals, who conceived of the divine essence as a universal nature and the persons as particulars of that nature (Lahey 2006: 127–65). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it is true more generally about all later-medieval Trinitarian theology, from the late thirteenth century and on, nevertheless the thought produced in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is particularly under-studied, and there is a large amount of source material waiting to be integrated into our picture of this extremely rich theological tapestry. As we come to grips with this material, it is sure to deepen our historical picture of later-medieval thought and to inject a voice of philosophical and theological sensitivity and rigor into our own discussion of the Trinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Orthodox Tradition</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">SINCE the Council of Nicaea (325) there has been a growing tendency in the East to view the most important Orthodox dogmatic teachings as complete and the questions connected with them as answered. Canon VII of the Council of Ephesus (431) decreed that the decisions made at the Council of Nicaea could no longer be amended, thus prohibiting the formulation of new creeds above and beyond the Symbol of Nicaea. In fact, it was not the Nicene Creed itself, but the Creed of the second Ecumenical Synod of Constantinople (381), which is based on the Nicene Creed, that became the sole symbol of the Orthodox Church, beyond which later Councils may still have formulated their Æqoi, but did not dare to establish new symbols of faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the Byzantine theologian Maximus the Confessor (579/80–662), who was, as Hans-Georg Beck noted in an assessment with a very western slant (Oberdorfer 2001: 143, n. </p>
<p class="calibre1">53, rightly observes how strongly Beck's underlying assessment criteria are influenced by the West), the ‘most universal mind of the 7th century and perhaps the last independently Page 1 of 16</p>

<p class="calibre1">thinking theologian of the Byzantine Church’ (Beck 1959: 436), when writing his liturgical commentary, shied away from newly interpreting passages of the Divine Liturgy that had previously been interpreted by Dionysius Areopagita, whom Maximus held in high esteem and who was revered as an apostolic authority beyond all doubt (von Balthasar 1961: 367). A general preference—at that time for the most part still  <b class="calibre3">(p. 211) </b>shared in the West</p>
<p class="calibre1">—for the ancient and traditional over the new, not yet tried and tested, as well as the binding character of the decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Councils for Roman imperial law, always made theological innovations, especially those in the area of the Trinity doctrine or Christology, seem suspicious to Byzantine theologians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to a widespread eastern self-image and contrary to western prejudices, eastern theology, in spite of this, was not paralysed, and by no means remained without creativity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, proposals for new ways of rethinking traditional positions almost always came from outside the Church, or from theologians who challenged whatever consensus had been reached up to that point. Only when it was necessary to defend the traditional against challenges from within or without were new statements risked in theology—</p>
<p class="calibre1">though more so in the field of questions on which there were no conciliar provisions, such as was exemplified by St Gregorios Palamas (1296–1359) in the development of the doctrine of the divine energies, or by St Nicholas Cabasilas ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1320– <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1397), with his theology of mysteries (sacraments). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Complementary to an understanding of theology as a strictly rational permeation of doctrines, there is also, very early in the eastern Church, an understanding of theology as teachings cast in hymns and expressed through pictures. Saint Ephraem the Syrian ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">306–73) carried out theology predominantly in this vein, and one of the most important writings of Basil the Great (329/30–79), that entitled ‘On the Holy Spirit’, in reality treats a liturgical question, namely that of the correct doxology of the Father and the Son ‘with the Holy Spirit’, and repeatedly includes the liturgical tradition as an essential component of historical tradition in his argumentation. After a long phase of diffidence towards ecclesiastic poetry, Byzantine theologians began to compose  <i class="calibre4">kontakia</i> in the sixth century (Stephan 2001), whose  <i class="calibre4">proemia</i> mainly treat questions of dogma. Over time, canon poetry, which presumably goes back to the seventh century (Felmy 2001), widely dispelled the <i class="calibre4">kontakia</i>. Canon poetry reached its highest point in the eighth century, although canons of the highest poetic and theological quality were still being written in the 9th century, and these repeatedly included the Trinity doctrine. In the ninth century, we have first and foremost Theodoros Graptos (born 775), Theophanes Graptos (775–843), Theodoros Studites (759–826), and Josef the Hymnographer (816–86), as well as the nun Cassia (born  <i class="calibre4">c</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">910) (Schmalzbauer 1996), who wrote several  <i class="calibre4">idiomela</i> that are still sung today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Pentecostal canon was in fact written earlier, by Cosmas of Maiuma (second half of the eighth century) (Hoffmann 2001; Hörandner 1997). However, the increasing development of this festival from its original purpose, to celebrate the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, into the feast of the Holy Trinity, which later found its conclusion in Russia, is reflected in the  <i class="calibre4">idiomelon</i> of the Emperor Leon VI the Wise (886–912), which gave the trishagion, originally most likely understood Christologically, a Trinitarian interpretation Page 2 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a><b class="calibre3">The Development of the Trinity Doctrine in Byzantium (Ninth to Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">(Plank 1992,  <i class="calibre4">passim</i>) and taught the appearance (not the proceeding) of the Holy Spirit in the world through the Son, and sang of the Holy Spirit as He who proceeds from the Father and rests in the Son (Πεντηκοστάριον 218). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The increasing transformation of the Feast of Pentecost into the Feast of the Holy Trinity (in Greek, this feast is to this day called Κυριακή τη̑ς Πεντηκοστης,  <i class="calibre4">Sunday of Pentecost</i>, whereas in Russia it is more often called День Святой Троицы,  <i class="calibre4">Day of Holy</i>  <b class="calibre3">(p. 212) </b>  <i class="calibre4">Trinity</i>) was also reflected in the growing numbers of the Trinity icon and in its reshaping as the best-known Trinity icon of St Andrej Rublev (1360–1427) in the Russian Church, which at that time was still under the jurisdiction of Constantinople. In a more traditional way than with certain later Byzantine theologians (see below), in this image it is not so much the unity as the independence of the three hypostases of the Trinity linked by love that is portrayed and emphasized (Felmy 2004: 56–63). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Beginnings of the Debate on the Proceeding of the Holy Spirit</b> If Byzantine theology rose to meet challenges from within and without, rather than being inclined to follow up, on its own initiative, on issues of the Trinity doctrine that were in principle considered to be closed cases, the West soon presented it with such a challenge, by becoming increasingly fixated on Augustine with his tendency towards a doctrine of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit from the Father  <i class="calibre4">and the Son</i> ( <i class="calibre4">ex Patre Filioque</i>). As long as the West, with its new theological orientation, did not affect the text of the creed and, despite Augustine's leaning towards the doctrine of proceeding from the Father  <i class="calibre4">and</i> the Son, continued to adhere to the proceeding of the Holy Spirit  <i class="calibre4">principaliter</i> a Patre, which he taught all the same, the East did not react to the tendencies of the West to assume that the Son participated in the proceeding of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without question, Augustine's contribution was decisive for the development of the doctrine of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit  <i class="calibre4">ex Patre Filioque</i>, over which the conflict, and in 1054 the schism, between the eastern and the western Church arose. According to Augustine's teaching, the Father and the Son breathe the Spirit back and forth to one another. The Holy Spirit is thus the Gift of the Father and the Son. It is, as their Gift, the bond of love that connects the Father and the Son with each other (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> 5.16). But in doing so, Augustine was not thinking in inner-Trinitarian terms, but he assumed that the Holy Spirit, in the economy of salvation, is a gift and a donation. Because it is given to creation, it also proceeds from the Father and the Son in the sense that it is their gift to each other (Mühlenberg 1982: 430). Therefore we find here for the first time in the Trinity doctrine the axiom, though as yet not explicitly expressed, that there exists not only an outward relationship between the inner-Trinitarian existence and the economical workings of the Holy Trinity, but that the inner-Trinitarian relationship and the outer-Trinitarian workings, essence, and economy of the Trinity are completely identical. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Augustine did not have in mind changing the text of the Nicene Creed. Furthermore, there are still diverse lines in his theological thinking. Alongside what one could call the true Augustine line just sketched, he maintains the old line of thinking according to which the Father is to be thought of as the  <i class="calibre4">principium deitatis</i>. In order to balance the traditional line with his own new line, Augustine taught the proceeding of the Holy  <b class="calibre3">(p. 213) </b>Spirit <i class="calibre4">principaliter a Patre et a Filio</i>. And yet with the new line existing alongside the old, he seemed to have found the solution to a problem for which the Cappadocian Fathers, who shaped the eastern theology, had found none. They were hesitant to specify the difference between the begetting of the only begotten Son and the proceeding of the Holy Spirit. According to Augustine, the main difference between the Son's begetting and the proceeding of the Holy Spirit is that the Son has his origin only in the Father, but the Holy Spirit in both the Father and the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> is taught  <i class="calibre4">expressis verbis</i> for the first time in a document that in its entire approach is typically western and that probably originates in Augustine's school in Spain: the so-called Athanasian Creed, often called the  <i class="calibre4">Quicumque</i> after its opening words (Collins 1979: 332). </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a previous synod in Toledo had yet omitted a doctrine of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son in its profession of faith (Oberdorfer 2001: 131), the third Synod of Toledo in the year 589 imposed the penalty of anathema on all who denied that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father  <i class="calibre4">and the Son</i>. Evidently, the Fathers of this synod were of the opinion that this was the only way to overthrow once and for all both Arianism, which the Visigoth king Reccared renounced at said synod, and the denial of the divinity of the Holy Spirit as was practised by that king's father, King Leovigild. And yet it seems that the synod did not yet touch the text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan symbol itself at that time, but left it in its original version—without  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> (Gemeinhardt 2002: 5–55). This conclusion follows, in any case, from the older of the extant manuscripts of the synodal resolutions. It was not until the eighth Synod of Toledo in 653 that a text was adopted in which the wording of the Niceno-Constantinopolitanum itself was altered (Gemeinhardt 2002: 53–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For its further development, the reception of the doctrine and of the formulation of the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> by the Frankish Church is of crucial significance. At the time a young Church, the Frankish Church sought theological conflict with Constantinople, in order to prove itself a worthy successor to Constantinople as the keeper of the true faith. The ‘suitability’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> issue for this conflict was not recognized right away, however, and the dispute concentrated initially on the question of icons (Gemeinhardt 2002: 88ff.). But the ‘capitulary’ made at the court of Charlemagne, which in the year 792 was taken to Rome, focuses on the problem in Trinitarian theology of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit, in that it argues against a text by the Constantinopolitan Patriarch Tarasius (784–806) contained in the synodal files of the seventh Ecumenical Council of Nicaea (787), which professes: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘and in the Holy Spirit, who is the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father through the Son and who himself is God and is recognized [as such]’ (Concilium Nicaenum II, actio III (Mansi 1766: vol. 12, 1119E–1127A, here at 1121CD)). Though this Page 4 of 16</p>

<p class="calibre1">text has more affinity with the western doctrine in the sense that it speaks of an involvement of the Second Hypostasis in the proceeding of the Holy Spirit, it still met with harsh criticism from the Franks, because by this time the Frankish theologians were convinced that  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> was the original version; they deemed it insufficient that the Second Hypostasis should function as a mere intermediary in the procession of the Holy Spirit. Pope Adrian  <b class="calibre3">(p. 214) </b>(772–95), however, essentially decided in favour of the Constantinople party (Gemeinhardt 2002: 108–13). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A first very careful reaction to this special western doctrine is found as early as Maximus the Confessor. He still defended the Latins by attempting to interpret the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> in the sense of the di’ uÕo¤ of the Patriarch Tarasius. The Latin Church Fathers, he wrote, in their teaching of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit, did not make the Son the origin (a¬týa) of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still entirely without polemic, St John of Damascus ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.650–before 754) rejects the doctrine of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit from the Father  <i class="calibre4">and</i> from the Son in his  <i class="calibre4">Exact</i> <i class="calibre4">Exposition of the Orthodox Faith</i> when he writes: Therefore we name not three gods the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but rather one God, the Holy Trinity, for Son and Spirit lead back to  <i class="calibre4">one</i> principle, they are not put together or melt together, as Sabellius would have it (for they are unified, as I say, not in that they mix together, but in that they adhere to one another, and have the state of being in one another (ἐν ἀλλήλοις περιχώρησιν) without any mixture or amalgamation). (John of Damascus,  <i class="calibre4">De fide Orthodoxa</i> I.8; PG 94: 829) In the exposition of the relationship of the Son and the Spirit to the Father, the completely unpolemical and yet unequivocal rejection of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> then follows: The Son we call neither fundament nor Father, but we say he is from the Father and the Son of the Father; the Holy Spirit, however, we say is from the Father, and we call him the Spirit of the Father. But we do not say that the Spirit is from the Son, and yet we call him the Spirit of the Son … of the Son, however, we say neither that he is of the Spirit, nor yet from the Spirit. (John of Damascus,  <i class="calibre4">De fide Orthodoxa</i> I.8; PG 94: 832–3) This last sentence is important, for it refutes the fear that a creed without the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> would diminish the honour of the Son. After all, he reasons, the honour of the Holy Spirit is likewise not lessened by the fact that the Son is neither of the Spirit nor from the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More crucial, however, is the fact that behind John Damascene's polite rejection of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> lurks the wholly diverse eastern approach to Trinitarian theology. He speaks of God's unity because the Son and the Spirit are founded on the same principle, the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> in this Trinitarian context would annul the unity of the Trinity! </p>

<p class="calibre1">The insertion of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> led to a true clash when Frankish monks used the Niceno-Constantinopolitan creed on the Mount of Olives in the form which had become common in the Frankish realm (i.e. with the addition of  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>). A monk from the monastery of St Sabas in the Kidron Valley subsequently accused the Frankish monks of heresy (Gemeinhardt 2002: 142ff.). An appeal on the pope's judgement ended with success for the eastern side to the extent that Pope Leo III (795–816), as reported by Anastasius Bibliothecarius, ‘for the sake of love and of care for the true faith’ had ‘two silver tablets’ made, ‘on each of which the Symbol was written, one in Greek letters and the other in Latin, on the right and the left above the entrance to the tomb’ of St Peter—without the controversial addition of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>. Similar tablets were also installed in the church of San Paolo Fuori le Mura (Gemeinhardt 2002: 163). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 215) Patriarch Photius and the</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Filioque</b></i> <b class="calibre3">Conflict</b> When considering the developments in the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> conflict under the patriarchate of Photius ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.810–93/94; Patriarch of Constantinople 858–67, 877–86), we cannot fully disregard the political and Church-political implications (Gemeinhardt 2002: 165–298 treats not only the theological questions, but also the attendant political circumstances and preconditions in great detail; on the topic as a whole see Hergenröther 1867–9). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Photius, one of the most learned members of the Byzantine aristocracy, had been consecrated archbishop and patriarch of Constantinople in the year 858 under Emperor Michael III (842–67) at the instigation of Caesar Bardas. He was the successor of Patriarch Ignatius (d. 877; Patriarch 846–58, 867–77), who after the fall of Empress Theodora II was forced to resign and was banned from Constantinople. Ignatius, who did not acknowledge his deposition, turned to the Roman pope, Nicholas I (858–67), who in a hitherto unusual estimation of his papal competences excommunicated Photius and reinstated Ignatius. Photius, who did not acknowledge the pope's actions, convoked a synod in Constantinople in 867, which declared the pope to be deposed. This led to a schism between Rome and Constantinople. When in the year 866 the Bulgarian khan, Boris I, despite Byzantine efforts decided to take on the Roman version of Christianity, a stormy polemic broke out between Rome and Constantinople in the context of which Patriarch Photius had all western special developments, especially in the liturgy, condemned and polemicized particularly strongly against the introduction of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> to the creed. It was in the context of this conflict that Photius wrote his ‘Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit’ (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i>, passim). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This text holds the insertion of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> to jeopardize the monarchy of the Father, to invert it into a diarchy, to detract from the honour of the Third Hypostasis and its position in the Trinity; it sees the Holy Spirit as thus being ‘blasphemed as being inferior than the Son’ (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 84; PG 102: 313). In Jn 16:14 Christ does not say: the Holy Spirit receives ‘of Me’, but He receives ‘of Mine’ (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 77; PG </p>
<p class="calibre1">102: 300). </p>

<p class="calibre1">Although you do not change the words, yet by subterfuge you commit the crime of changing ‘of Mine’ to ‘of Me’, and by this manoeuvre, you accuse the Saviour of teaching that which you believe. You distinctly slander Him of these three things: that He said what He did not say; that He did not say what He did say; and that He professed a meaning of the passage which He not only did not express, but which, on the contrary, is obviously opposed to His own mystagogy. (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On</i> <i class="calibre4">the Mystagogy</i> 79; PG 102: 304)</p>
<p class="calibre1">That the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father is a property of the Father that cannot be transferred from Him to another hypostasis (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 76; PG 102: 296f.). If the Son as well is attributed with the capability of being an origin (ἀρχή, αἰτία, <b class="calibre3">(p. 216) </b>ἄιτιον), then either the hypostases of Father and Son are modalistically mixed (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 75; PG 102: 293), or two origins are seen in God, which would amount to a Marcionitic dualism (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 85; PG 102: 316). In any case, this view fails to recognize the μοναρχία and thereby the unity of God. By the assumption that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit is moved farther from the Father than is the Son (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 87; PG 102: 320). It is not the common nature of the Father and the Son that is the origin of the Holy Spirit, but the person, the hypostasis of the Father (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 89; PG </p>
<p class="calibre1">102: 325). Photius takes great care in his exposition to properly explain the designation of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the Son (Gal. 4:6). If the apostle Paul here were teaching the procession of the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son, he would contradict and correct the teachings of the Saviour Himself (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 90; PG 102: 328). </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this cannot be the case, says Photius; instead, the Apostle intends to bear witness, with very wisely chosen words, to the consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the</i> <i class="calibre4">Mystagogy</i> 91; PG 102: 329). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul is demonstrating the identity of the nature, and in no wise does he imply the cause of procession. He acknowledges the unity of essence, but incontrovertibly does not proclaim that the Son brings forth a consubstantial hypostasis; indeed, he does not even hint concerning the origin. (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 91; PG </p>
<p class="calibre1">102: 329)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the Spirit of the Father and the Spirit of the Son, because it is of the same essence as both. It proceeds no more from the Son, as whose Spirit it is designated, than it does from the mental faculties of wisdom, understanding, and recognition, although it is called </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the Spirit of wisdom, understanding, and recognition’ (Exodus 31:3) (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the</i> <i class="calibre4">Mystagogy</i> 94f.; PG 102: 336). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular, Photius is against taking on the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> for the mere reason that some of the Fathers appear to have taught it, and against making a dogma out of a point that some of the Church Fathers have taught without claiming dogmatic validity for it. Photius cites unclear thoughts among some of the Fathers, who in spite of this are highly esteemed in the Church, as for example the saints Clement, Irenaeus, and Hippolytus (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 102; PG 102: 356). Even Basil the Great, he claims, for a time Page 7 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a><b class="calibre3">The Development of the Trinity Doctrine in Byzantium (Ninth to Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">did not profess the divinity of the Holy Spirit, but this not in order to deny it, but so that it might later be professed with that much louder a voice (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 103; PG 102: 357). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Patriarch Photius further states, the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> also contradicts the witness of several popes, who either did not teach the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> or even resisted it. This is particularly the case with Pope Leo III (795–816), who had two tablets made on which the Greek text of the Nicene Creed is to be seen without the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 112; PG </p>
<p class="calibre1">102: 380). This version of the text was in the end acknowledged as authentic by Pope Adrian III (884–5) as well (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 112; PG 102: 381). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Photius would not be the great philologist as whom we know him today if he had not added to his expositions on the Latin Church Fathers who taught the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> contrary <b class="calibre3">(p. 217) </b>to general tradition the complaint that the Latin language was unsuitable for treating dogmatic issues with as much sophistication as is possible in Greek (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On</i> <i class="calibre4">the Mystagogy</i> 110; PG 102: 376). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The phrase ἐκ μόνου του̑ πατρός, considered as a typical Photian formulation, does not appear word for word in the ‘Mystagogy’, though its sense is certainly contained here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The title, probably secondary and summarizing the contents of the ‘Mystagogy’, does however contain this wording:</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit. That even as the Son is proclaimed by the Sacred Oracles to be begotten of the Father alone (ἐκ μόνου του̑ πατρός), so also is the Holy Spirit proclaimed by theology to proceed from the same and only cause. He is however said to be of the Son, since He is of one essence with Him and is sent through Him. (Photius,  <i class="calibre4">On the Mystagogy</i> 67; PG 102: 279f.) Whether one could somehow still speak of the Holy Spirit as proceeding  <i class="calibre4">through</i> the Son does not interest Photius, because his focus is on the monarchy of the Father, which, though not necessarily impacted by the phrase ‘through the Son’, would in no case be supported by it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet Patriarch Photius did not see the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> as the western dogma purely and simply. It is indeed not by chance that he refers to Roman popes, who either did not mention the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> or even (like Pope Leo III) expressly rejected its addition to the Creed, or at least declined to ascribe any official validity to it. This was why it was possible for him to be reconciled with the successors of Nicholas I without an explicit papal correction of the doctrine of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit. Half a century later the situation was complicated even further by the official insertion of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> in the Roman version of the Niceno-Constantinopolitanum. This happened when the German king Henry II insisted on the insertion of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan symbol in the mass held at his coronation as Roman Emperor in the year 1014, namely, in the form in which it had already been used for some time in the Frankish mass, with the addition ‘Filioque’ (Jungmann 1948: 579). When the Church was separated in 1054 into East and West the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> played only a minor part, namely, of all things, in the completely unfounded accusation by the west</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a><b class="calibre3">The Development of the Trinity Doctrine in Byzantium (Ninth to Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ern Cardinal Humbert that the eastern Church had of its own accord left the originally recited  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> out of the creed (Oberdorfer 2001: 169–70). And yet the western insertion of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> in the official text of the Mass reflects an estrangement that Pope Leo III had still been intent on preventing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That estrangement can also be seen in the comparison of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit according to St Symeon the New Theologian (949–1022) with that of his disciple Niketas Stethatos ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1005– <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1085). There is almost no theologian in whose writing the workings of the Holy Spirit played a greater role than Symeon the New Theologian (Архиеп. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Василий (Кривошеин) 1980, passim). While in the doctrine of the proceeding of the Holy Spirit he does hold the traditional Orthodox position, it is without a trace of polemic and without being particularly insistent. It is possible that he was not at all familiar with the western special doctrine on the procession of the Holy Spirit  <i class="calibre4">ex Patre Filioque</i>. Nikethas Stethatos, in contrast, who emphasized the properties of the three  <b class="calibre3">(p. 218) </b>divine Hypostases even more than did Symeon the New Theologian, already reacts extremely polemically to the by now official Western  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>: They overthrow the entire Christian faith by not saying that the One is the principle of the Two [Son and Spirit], but groundlessly introduce a diarchy to the triad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This leads them either to the Sabellian mixture or to the Arianic splitting of the Trinity. They let the Son be the Father. If it is necessary for the Son likewise to give issue to the Spirit, in order to be of one essence with the Father, then the Spirit must in turn also give issue to something, in order to be of the same essence with the Father and the Son. (Cited in Wessel 1982: 357; Sabellius did not make a distinction between persons, but only between ‘modi’ of the one person's effects, and is therefore designated a modalist.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">‘You are the One who Receives and is Distributed’ and ‘The Father is Greater than I’</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the ‘codex Barberini gr 336’, the oldest extant manuscript of the Byzantine  <i class="calibre4">euchologion</i>, which also contains the prayers of the liturgy of St Basil and of St John Chrysostomus, there is a prayer that is missing in many of the more recent manuscripts, and thus had evidently only been inserted in the liturgy shortly before the codex Barberini was written, but had not yet become widely accepted. It is the only prayer of the Divine Liturgy that is addressed to the Second Hypostasis of the Holy Trinity, and it ends in ‘codex Barberini gr 336’ with the words addressed to Christ: ‘For You, Christ our God, are the Offerer and the Offered, the Hallower and the Hallowed, and to You we give glory’ ( <i class="calibre4">L’Eucologio Barberini</i> 62; Parenti and Velkovska 2000: 266). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This last part of the prayer was changed, probably around the time of Emperor Manuel I (1143–80), to read as it does today in the received text of the liturgy: ‘For You, Christ our God, are the Offerer and the Offered, the One who receives and is distributed, and to You Page 9 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a><b class="calibre3">The Development of the Trinity Doctrine in Byzantium (Ninth to Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">we give glory’ (Ἱερατικόν 87: 127). Christ is, according to this prayer, not only the sacrificer and the sacrifice, but also He who accepts the sacrifice. This means the sacrifice of the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> incarnate was offered not only to God the Father, but also to the Holy Spirit and the Son, the indivisible, single-essence Trinity. Soterichos Panteugenes, the deacon of Hagia Sophia and patriarch-elect of Antioch, took steps against this view and its expression in the new version of the prayer spoken at the Grand Entrance; he was supported by Eustathios of Dyrrhachion and the deacons Michail of Thessaloniki and Nikephoros Basilakes, all of whom were—disregarding their not yet very high position in the hierarchy—</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading theologians (Beck 1959: 623–4; Wessel 1982: 341–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A synod was summoned for 26 January 1156, because the monk chosen for the seat of the Metropolite of Kiev, Konstantinos, wished to have a clear answer for the questions raised before he left for Russia. The synod formulated anathematisms from  <b class="calibre3">(p. 219) </b>which the doctrines of Soterichos Panteugenes and his fellow campaigners can be deduced. Apparently they designated exclusively God the Father as the recipient of the sacrifice of Christ: the Divine Logos did not receive the offering of His own body and blood (anathematism 1). In connection with this, Soterichos rejected the idea that the Divine Liturgy be celebrated in honour of the Holy Trinity (anathematism 2). The daily offering of the Eucharist repeats the self-sacrifice of Christ φανταστικω̑ς καὶ εἰκονικω̑ς, that is, in mind and in image (anathematism 3). And finally they claim first the Son, upon becoming human, took in the mortals in grace, then the Father did so for the sake of Christ's suffering, and finally, humanity was accepted by the Holy Spirit (anathematism 4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast to these views, the synod decided in favour of the  <i class="calibre4">textus receptus</i> of the above-mentioned prayer: Christ's life-giving sacrifice was offered to the entire undivided single-essence Triad, and not to the Father alone. The opposing doctrine that rules out the Son and the Holy Spirit as recipients of Christ's sacrifice, it stated, splits the Trinity and robs the Son and the Holy Spirit of the same honour that is owed them together with the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against the symbolic reading of the Eucharistic sacrifice it was argued that the Eucharistic sacrifice is in no aspect different from Christ's sacrifice on the cross. For the Orthodox concept of the Eucharistic sacrifice it is essential that one cannot in this context speak of more than  <i class="calibre4">one</i> sacrifice, but only of one and the same sacrifice, so that in the liturgical sacrifice the sacrifice of Christ on the cross is present in the mind, but the former cannot add anything to the latter, because the two are identical. And against the doctrine of three stages in terms of humanity's receiving divine grace the succinct statement is given that the consubstantial and indivisible Trinity does not allow such a division (Wessel 1982: 344). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Soterichos Panteugenes, in contrast to his associates, did not abide by the resolution handed down by the synod, but rather wrote a paper defending his position, a new synod was called to session in May of 1157, which confirmed the decisions of the synod of 1156. A review of his views that came too late did not protect Soterichos from being stripped of his qualification for high religious office. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A second Trinitarian-Christological dispute during the reign of Emperor Manuel I concerned the right understanding of the word of Christ ‘My Father is greater than I’ (Jn 14:28). The conflict was initiated by one Dimitrios who had repeatedly travelled to the West as an emissary. He was driven by the question of whether Christ's word from the Gospel of John referred to Christ's divinity or his humanity. The explanation that the western Catholics give, that Christ is lower than God the Father and at the same time equal to Him, does not satisfy Dimitrios. In the writings of the holy Fathers of the eastern Church, he found different statements. (1) With the statement that the Father is greater than He, Christ was thinking only of the origin (ἀρχή) that caused Him, according to His divine nature. (2) According to other sources, Christ had His human nature in mind. (3) Yet other statements indicate that this sentence only referred to the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> in His state of humiliation. The Emperor Manuel I, who  <b class="calibre3">(p. 220) </b>dallied in theology, stated that in terms of His humanness, the Second Hypostasis is lower than the Father, but in terms of His divinity, He is equal with Him. A synod convened in 1166 in the palace of Blachern laid a creed before Dimitrios according to which Jn 14:28 refers to the ‘flesh of the Saviour, created and capable of suffering’ (Wessel 1982: 346). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity Doctrine of St Gregorios Palamas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Saint Gregorios Palamas (1296–1359) stuck with the received Orthodox doctrine regarding the Trinity in its fundamental traits, and therefore also rejected the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>. Several years ago, however, Reinhard Flogaus was able to show that Gregorios Palamas had no qualms about borrowing from, of all places, the writings of St Augustine (Flogaus 1997: 146), and that his Trinitarian theology thus was quite different from the established theology. Like Augustine, Gregorios Palamas speaks of analogies between the divinity and the man in God's image. God the Father, he says, corresponds to the human νου̑ς, and the counterpart of the Son is the Word which lies embedded in the human νου̑ς (λόγος </p>
<p class="calibre1">ἐμφύτως ἡμι̑ν ἐναποκείμενος τῳ̑ νῳ̑), or the knowledge that is always with him (ἡ ἀεὶ </p>
<p class="calibre1">συνυπάρχουσα αὐτῳ̑ γνω̑σις), respectively, but not the orally spoken word (λόγος </p>
<p class="calibre1">προφορικός) or the unspoken word (λόγος ἐνδιάθετος) lying dormant in the human (Flogaus 1997: 143). An analogy between the divine and the human kÖcor was also perceived by various eastern Church Fathers. The differences between the four types of human  <i class="calibre4">logos</i> are found in this manner only in Augustine (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> 15.10–15). In Augustine we also find the expositions on the various modes of Logos that were evidently borrowed from him by Gregorios Palamas (Flogaus 1997: 143–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is true of the doctrine of the divine Logos is also true of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. No one who is gifted with the νου̑ς could—says Gregorios Palamas following Augustine—think a word without πνευ̑μα. ‘The Holy Spirit is Itself certainly neither πνευ̑μα </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the sense of that breath that accompanies the λόγος προφορικός that is spoken with our lips, nor is it connected with the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος or the λόγος ἐν διανοίᾳ, as this would imply a temporal existence and thus also the potential for change. That πνευ̑μα of the most high Word is rather the unspeakable love of the Procreator to the Logos begotten by Him in unspeakable manner, with which the beloved Son as well loves the Father, Page 11 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a><b class="calibre3">The Development of the Trinity Doctrine in Byzantium (Ninth to Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">to the extent that He has already received from the Father this love that proceeds with Him and rests on Him’ (Flogaus 1997: 146). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This interpretation of the Holy Spirit as an inner-Trinitarian love of the Father and the Son can, as Reinhard Flogaus notes, be found in the writings of no other eastern Church Father before Gregorios Palamas, and must therefore be seen as a loan from Augustine, <b class="calibre3">(p. 221) </b>as incidentally the Orthodox theologian Protopresbyter Jean Meyendorff had suspected (Meyendorff 1959: 316). Because analogies to Augustine's  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> can be proven in much greater number than previously known, the dependence of St Gregorios Palamas on St Augustine that Jean Meyendorff construed can be claimed without a doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the differences in terminological detail Gregorios Palamas is even dependent on Augustine when he describes the Spirit as the common joy of the Father and the Son (Flogaus 1997: 150). </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, whereas in Occidental theology the statements on the Holy Spirit as a bond of love between Father and Son served to support the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, Gregorios Palamas at this point diverges from his model. Here it is interesting to note the above-cited statement, among others, that the Son ‘has already received from the Father this love that proceeds with Him and rests on Him’, with which the one equal originality of the Father and the Son is rejected (see above). Despite his clear dependence on Augustine, Gregorios Palamas declines to follow him not only on the question of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, but also where Augustine declares ‘it is the Holy Spirit Itself that is poured out as love in our hearts’ (Flogaus 1997: 149). As Palamas sees it, it is not the Holy Spirit Itself that is poured out in the hearts, but the Divine Energies, which he distinguishes from the essence of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this respect, the distinction—which Gregorios Palamas may not have invented, but which he at least developed to a certain conclusion—between the Divine being and the Divine Energies touches on the Trinity doctrine itself. It is not completely unfounded that Dorothea Wendebourg in this context spoke of a ‘de-functionalization’ of the Holy Spirit (Wendebourg 1980), a charge that could in fact be aimed at Augustine for even more cogent reasons. And yet even the Russian priest and religious philosopher Pavel Florenskij, himself under no suspicion of harbouring any all too great western sympathies, raised a charge similar to that expressed recently by Wendebourg. ‘Unnoticed and gradually’ a tendency had permeated the Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">to speak, rather than of the Holy Spirit, of ‘grace’, that is, of something already and conclusively impersonal. What we know is usually not the Holy Spirit, but Its gracious energies, Its powers, Its effects and workings. ‘Spirit’, ‘spiritual’, ‘spirit-giving’, ‘spirituality’, etc. pervade the works of the holy Fathers. But from these works it is also clear that the words ‘spirit’, ‘spiritual’, etc., refer to special states of the believer which are called forth by God, but which only slightly if at all have in their sights the personal independent existence of the third hypostasis of the all-holy Trinity. (Флоренский 1914: 123–4)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a><b class="calibre3">The Development of the Trinity Doctrine in Byzantium (Ninth to Fifteenth</b> <b class="calibre3">Centuries)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As applicable as these observations may be, it must nevertheless be emphasized that the Orthodox Church even at the time of St Gregorios Palamas maintained the sanctifying of the Eucharistic gifts through the invocation and effect of the Holy Spirit, and this ‘de-functionalization’ thus has always remained limited. The theological thinking of the Neopalamitic School of the twentieth century, with its ‘ “personalistic” correction of Palamism’ (Flogaus 1997: 189, n. 430), furthermore showed that the Palamitic doctrine of energies can also stand in the context of a strongly pneumatologically oriented theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 222) The Trinity Doctrine of Patriarch Gennadios II</b> From earliest times the Orthodox Trinitarian theology differed from that of the West essentially in its stronger emphasis of the independence of the three hypostases of the Trinity. For the dialogue with monotheistic Islam this position is not particularly favourable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus the first Constantinopolitan patriarch under Islamic rule, Gennadios II (1453–6, 1458–63) (Blanchet 2008; Tinnefeld 1984), attempted by means of a peculiar new interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma to make the position of the Orthodox Church plausible to the Ottoman conquerors. The doctrine of the three hypostases he explained in his  <i class="calibre4">Homologia</i> (Καρμίρης 1968: 432–6) as a doctrine of three ¬diώlata. Here he went so far as to claim that the three hypostases of the Trinity were distinguished no differently than were God's essence and energies in the thinking of St Gregorios Palamas. ‘As fire, even if there is nothing to be illuminated and warmed by it, yet always has light and warmth and radiates light and warmth, so—even before the world was created—the Logos and the Spirit existed as physical energies of God, for God is one, just as in one human soul there is reason, intellect and thinking will and at the same time these three are in their essence one soul’ (Καρμίρης 1968: 433). For Gennadios, all old-Church anthropological analogies serve to prove the  <i class="calibre4">unity</i> of the Trinity, not to explain the  <i class="calibre4">homousia</i> of  <i class="calibre4">three</i> independent hypostases. However, this viewpoint, with its obvious apologetic motivation, was not capable of influencing the further development of the history of Orthodox theology. </p>
