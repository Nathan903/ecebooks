<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This introductory article discusses the theme of this volume, which is about the history of Trinitarian theology. This volume is divided into seven sections that cover general topics, including the Trinity in Scripture, patristic witnesses to the Trinitarian faith and medieval appropriations of the Trinitarian faith. It provides a valuable ecumenical overview of the key theological and philosophical discussions relating to the Trinity and reflects on the practical import of Trinitarian theology in the liturgy, art, and politics. It also charts the development of theological doctrine from the New Testament writings through the patristic medieval, Reformation, modern, and contemporary periods of Trinitarian reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, Scripture, patristic witness, Trinitarian faith, liturgy, art, politics, New Testament, Reformation</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE development of Trinitarian theology constitutes one of the characteristic traits of contemporary theology. This development is a complex phenomenon that one can observe at least since the 1960s. It is often characterized as a ‘renewal’ or a ‘rediscovery’, but historical studies invite us to nuance this judgement, because in reality reflection on the Trinity has never ceased to be fruitful and to give rise to new approaches. It is perhaps more exact to speak of ‘development’ in order to describe the scope and multiplication of recent publications in this domain. This development is still ongoing, and it is probably too early to speak of a ‘maturity’: the enquiry continues to feel its way forward, and has not yet born full fruit. This Handbook bears witness to the  <i class="calibre4">enquiry</i> that characterizes contemporary Trinitarian thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While recognizing the great diversity of the currents within this development, one can observe certain fundamental elements common to the contemporary enquiry: <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> The Trinity is not a mystery among others, but it constitutes the central mystery of Christian faith and should illumine the entirety of the Christian life. The Trinity is the mystery of salvation, as Karl Rahner vigorously reminded us: ‘The Trinity is a mystery of  <i class="calibre4">salvation</i>, otherwise it would never have been revealed’ (Rahner 2001: 21; Page 1 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">italics in original). Trinitarian theology is situated at the heart of a  <i class="calibre4">nexus</i> that is indispensable for understanding its meaning: the liturgy (which, in the concrete life of Christians, certainly has the first place), biblical exegesis, the dogmatic and moral ecclesial tradition, the teaching of the saints, the historical inheritance of the great theological syntheses, the necessary recourse to philosophy for expositing the faith, the task of preaching and the proclamation of the faith, relationships to politics and society, and the encounter with non-Christian cultures and religions. The fundamental nexus, formulated in an exemplary way by St Basil of Caesarea in the fourth century, is constituted by the sacraments (baptism), the confession of faith (creed), and the ecclesial prayer (doxology), ‘in conformity with the meaning of the Scriptures’: <b class="calibre3">(p. 2)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As we are  <i class="calibre4">baptized</i>, so, also, do we  <i class="calibre4">believe</i>; as we believe, so, also, do we  <i class="calibre4">give</i> <i class="calibre4">glory</i>. Therefore, since  <i class="calibre4">baptism</i> has been given to us by the Savior in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we offer a confession of faith consistent with our baptism, and also the doxology consistent with our faith, glorifying the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son ( <i class="calibre4">Letter</i> 159, in Basil of Caesarea 1981: 313; emphasis ours). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> Trinitarian theology is intrinsically connected to Christology. Contemporary reflection seeks to avoid the dichotomy that separated what is ‘Trinitarian’ from what is ‘Christological’. On the one hand, contemporary works often underscore that Jesus’ Pasch (passion, death, resurrection, ascension, pentecost) is the ‘place’ par excellence of the revelation of the Trinity, without forgetting the presence and action of the Spirit in the life of Christ (‘pneumatic Christology’). On the other hand, Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">words and actions, which the New Testament teaches, only possess their full meaning in light of faith in the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> Trinitarian faith is not limited to illuminating the sphere of redemption and salvation, but it equally concerns creation: the doctrine of creation calls for a properly Trinitarian consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> The majority of studies—not only the systematic works but also the biblical and histories studies—pay attention to the problematic of the unity and distinction between the ‘economic Trinity’ and the ‘immanent Trinity’ (or, if one prefers, between the Trinity in its work of creation and grace, and the Trinity in its inner life). The question of the relationships between the Trinity and  <i class="calibre4">history</i> is often found at the centre of contemporary writing on the Trinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(7)</b> Patristic doctrines today receive renewed attention in order to understand and express the monotheism proper to Christian Trinitarian faith, not only because of contemporary religious pluralism, but also in critical reaction to the  <i class="calibre4">hubris</i> of the idealist subjectivity that has marked the modern conception of God (God as the Absolute Spirit which expresses itself in the human spirit). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(8)</b> Ecumenical discussions of the Holy Spirit, especially between the eastern and western traditions ( <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, divine energies), exercise a determinative role in contemporary reflections, beyond that of ecumenical studies in the strict sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(9)</b> Interreligious dialogue, along with the dialogue of Christianity with cultures (without forgetting the confrontation of Christianity with atheism, which today enjoys a revival in western societies), likewise plays a role whose importance continues to increase. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 3) </b>Writing on the Trinity is not limited to books and essays that are devoted exclusively to the doctrine of the Trinity. Simplifying a little, one can observe three principal categories of studies ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Durand 2010: 9–10). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> New ‘treatises’ devoted to the mystery of the Trinity are not numerous. Only a few theologians, such as Karl Barth, Michael Schmaus, Karl Rahner, and Jürgen Moltmann, have formally undertaken this task. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> Many theologians have placed the consideration of the Trinitarian mystery at the centre of their dogmatic proposals (for example Eberhard Jüngel, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Wohlfart Pannenberg, Robert Jenson). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> More broadly, numerous books and essays in recent decades have treated particular aspects of Trinitarian doctrine (consider, for instance, the works of the French theologians Louis Bouyer and Yves Congar) or particular periods of the history of Trinitarian doctrines (for example Thomas F. Torrance, Lewis Ayres). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little by little, in diverse fields of theological reflection, works have appeared that attempt to realize that programme that, already in 1952, Hans Urs von Balthasar had in view: ‘Christian proclamation in the school, from the pulpit, and in the lecture halls of the universities could be so much more alive, if  <i class="calibre4">all</i> the theological tractates were given a complete trinitarian form!’ (Balthasar 1993: 29; italics in the English translation)—‘Wie lebendig könnte die christliche Verkündigung in der Schule, von der Kanzel, auf den Kathedern sein, wenn alle theologischen Traktate trinitarisch duchrformt wären!’ (Balthasar 1952: 18). Henceforth one sees develop Trinitarian Christologies and treatises on creation structured in a Trinitarian manner. Still more, essays on ‘Trinitarian ontology’ express in a striking way the search for a unified understanding of all reality in light of faith in the Trinity. In addition to these new efforts, it appears more and more clearly that the doctrine of the Trinity goes beyond purely instrumental usages and that it should avoid ‘functionalization’, in order to become again what it is in the New Testament: the Christian teaching on God, with regard to the vivid knowledge of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit who is the very object of Revelation and therefore of all Christian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One domain of research seems, however, to be developed in a particularly extensive way: that of historical studies. The present Handbook wished to honour this aspect: 18 contributions of this volume are devoted to the patristic, medieval, and modern history of Trinitarian theology. The interest in history is not surprising because, on this topic perhaps more than any other, reference to the dogmatic tradition and to theological traditions plays a determinative role. What one means by ‘Trinitarian faith’ can hardly be understood outside of reference to the councils of Nicaea and Constantinople and to their reception: the doctrine of the Trinity is indissociably connected to the reading of Scripture through the ecclesial and theological traditions, with the result that the development of Trinitarian theology today appears generally as a creative reappropriation of the patristic and medieval sources. In this history, a special place rightly belongs to the patristic period, but the medieval period also deserves particular attention, both because of the extensions of patristic thought that it offers (continuity), and because of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 4) </b>the creative syntheses that it shows (newness). There is no ‘blank space’ between the patristic age and the era of the Reformation. In the same way, contrary to certain widespread prejudices, the modern period reveals itself to be surprisingly fecund in this domain. The modern period is characterized especially by the arrival of  <i class="calibre4">history</i>, under two principal aspects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, Trinitarian enquiry has been marked since the seventeenth century by the impact of the historical method, and then by history as a theological discipline—under the name </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘historical theology’ since the beginning of the twentieth century. Second, the development of systematic Trinitarian theology owes much to ‘philosophies of history’, in particular that of Hegel, which have considerably influenced the destiny of Trinitarian theology, although the consequences are ambiguous (Holzer 2008; for a critical reflection on this subject, see Ayres 2004: 384–429). The modern period presented other challenges, in particular one that involves the notion of ‘person’ and that at times gave rise—paradoxically</p>
<p class="calibre1">—to a ‘depersonalization’ of the Trinity. The impact of the notion of ‘person’ derived from seventeenth-century philosophy appears already in the controversies of that epoch, in England, between Unitarians and Trinitarians (Dixon 2003; Libera 2007: 101–23). In analytic philosophy today, the notion of ‘person’ is often defined by the capacity for self-reflection or by the matrix of representation and recognition, in either case posing a challenge for theological thought (Allard 2010). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contemporary theology, the principal ‘theological loci’ are Trinity and creation, Trinity and history, Trinity and monotheism, Trinity and Christology, Trinity and grace, and more broadly Trinity and human life (ethics, society, interreligious dialogue, politics and culture). All these theological loci are connected to biblical, liturgical, patristic, and historical renewals—without forgetting the revival of the eschatological dimension of biblical faith. It is clear that the liturgical renewal and communion ecclesiology, for example, are not posterior in time to the development of Trinitarian enquiry: we are dealing with concomitant movements. Thus, for over a century, ecclesiology has been marked by an effort to renew itself from a Trinitarian perspective. It is necessary finally to note that contemporary Trinitarian theology is no longer presented under the rubric of a unified doctrine and language. Formerly, St Bonaventure and St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, elaborated different Trinitarian theologies, but their theological language and their references Page 4 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">were similar: they spoke the same theological language, on the basis of common sources and with a common method. This no longer happens today. The diversification of languages, methods, and theological and philosophical sources is certainly a cause of a real difficulty, for students as well as for teachers, with respect to a unified presentation of faith in the Trinity. Trinitarian theology has also been widely freed from its connection to the literary genre of the theological manual, in order to appear in works that bear the marks of their authors and their own intellectual enquiry. This phenomenon, as one would expect, brings today a diversification of points of view, to which this Handbook bears witness in its way. We have sought to offer readers essays that do justice to this diversification of points of view, while also offering, in so far as possible, a coherent ensemble. The present Handbook is not a theologically neutral encyclopaedia, but rather  <b class="calibre3">(p. 5) </b>presents contributions from scholars who differ on many points but who generally agree in working out their Trinitarian theology in relation to the Nicene faith. This Handbook thus offers not only a contribution to those who wish to know the history of Trinitarian theology, but it also reveals the Nicene unity still at work among Christians today despite the presence of ecumenical differences and the variety of theological perspectives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chapters that follow are divided into seven parts covering seven general topics: the Trinity in Scripture, Patristic witnesses to the Trinitarian faith, Medieval appropriations of the Trinitarian faith, From the Reformation to the Twentieth century, Trinitarian Dogmatics, the Trinity and Christian life, and dialogues. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Scripture</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This first section considers Trinitarian doctrine in Christian Scripture, which attained canonical form during the same period in which Trinitarian doctrine was taking shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Khaled Anatolios shows that the fluidity of the canon in the first centuries does not appear to have affected Trinitarian doctrine. Yet the development of the notion of ‘canonicity’ itself speaks to the understanding of revelation at work in the development of Trinitarian doctrine, and the canon of Scripture also provides certain norms that shaped the development of Trinitarian doctrine, such as the identity of the God of the Old Testament with the God of the New, the rule of faith as an interpretive key, the Christological reading of Scripture, and the understanding of history in light of missions of Christ and the Holy Spirit. Exploring the topic of the Trinity in the Old Testament, Christopher Seitz begins by noting the history-of-religions approach, which correlates certain developments within Israel's worship of one God with what Christians identified as distinct hypostases in God. Seitz proposes an alternative approach, namely that of recognizing that descriptions of Israel's God may have not only a referent within ancient Israel but also, in God's providence, a further divinely intended referent. The latter referent is not extrinsic to the former, because it is the pressure of the affirmations about Israel's one God, in light of the work of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, that lead Christians to identify Jesus and the Spirit in Trinitarian fashion. Kavin Rowe takes up the Trinity in the Pauline epistles and Hebrews. Rather than seeking ‘proof-texts’ or studying the implications of particular words as applied to Jesus, Rowe suggests that the narrative fabric of the books sets forth an id</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">iom, a grammar or logic, that can only be rightly interpreted through Trinitarian conceptions. Examining the synoptic Gospels and Acts, Simon Gathercole begins with the point that the God and Father of Jesus Christ is the one God of Israel, the Creator who chose Israel and promised to restore her to holiness. The synoptic Gospels include Jesus within the divine name and attribute to him the divine power of electing and forgiving, as well as pre-existence, although the synoptic Gospels also indicate that the Son receives everything from the Father. The risen Jesus gives the Spirit, whose divine  <b class="calibre3">(p. 6) </b>personal agency appears particularly in Acts. In his essay on the Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and Revelation, Ben Witherington III argues that John does not simply derive his Father language from the Jewish wisdom literature (despite its recognizable influence), but instead has in view the Son's relationship to his Father. After the Ascension, the Son's agency on behalf of the Father is continued by the Spirit's agency on behalf of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus the Book of Revelation depicts the Father and the Son sitting on the divine throne while the Spirit dwells in the Church. Bringing this section to a close, Mark Edwards unites it to the next section by exploring how exegesis of Scripture, against the Gnostics’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">rejection of the Old Testament and in the face of other heterodox currents, led to the language in which Trinitarian doctrine was formulated during the first centuries of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">Patristic Witnesses to the Trinitarian Faith</b> Discussing the Trinity in the pre-Nicene Fathers, Stephen Hildebrand traces the evolution of Trinitarian thought from Apostolic Fathers like Ignatius of Antioch through the Apologists (St Justin Martyr, Theophilus of Antioch) to the great theologians of the late second and early third centuries: under the pressure of Gnostic and Monarchian theologies, a refining of theological language within a more systematic approach characterizes the work of Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian; the dominant themes are the Trinity in the economy, the emergence of a theology of the Spirit, the theological appropriation of Greek philosophical thought in an effort to explain the faith handed down, and the emergence of Trinitarian technical vocabulary. Warren Smith offers a nuanced account of the fourth-century Trinitarian controversies. He shows how these fundamentally exegetical controversies began with Arius’ insistence on the unique divine prerogatives of the Father and continued with decades of debate over the appropriateness of the word </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘ <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>’, which had been rejected by third-century synods in Antioch because of concerns about modalism. Lewis Ayres presents the Trinitarian theology of Augustine, structured around the Father's begetting of the Word that breathes forth Love. Ayres identifies the roots of Augustine's theology in the Latin anti-modalist tradition and in his appreciation of God's transcendent simplicity, and Ayres sets forth Augustine's emphasis on the salvific missions as drawing us into the mystery of the divine processions. Andrew Louth examines Trinitarian theology in the fifth through the eighth centuries, with particular attention to Cyril of Alexandria as a consolidator of Cappadocian doctrine, Dionysius the Areopagite with his emphasis on God as ever greater, Maximus the Confessor whose emphasis lies on the transformation of the soul brought about by contemplating the Trinity, and John Damascene who roots his Trinitarian doctrine in the unity of God. Louth points Page 6 of 12</p>

<p class="calibre1">out the importance of hymnody for transmitting Trinitarian doctrine, and he notes the impact of the rise of Islam. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 7) 3. </b> <b class="calibre3">Medieval Appropriations of the Trinitarian Faith</b> Discussing the period between 800 and 1100 in the West, Lauge Nielsen highlights four figures: Alcuin, Gottschalk, John Scotus Eriugena, and Anselm. Alcuin's work on the ‘undivided Trinity’ defends the Augustinian emphasis on the divine unity, whereas Eriugena draws on Greek Orthodox theology to emphasize the proper mode of action of the divine persons. Anselm relies upon the Augustinian image and defends the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> against Greek theologians. Dominique Poirel treats twelfth-century theologians in the West, most notably Peter Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, Richard of St Victor, and Peter Lombard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poirel examines the multiplication of models used to think about the Trinity: the triad </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘power—wisdom—goodness’, images in the human soul, traces in visible creation, interpersonal love. Despite tensions at the beginning of the period, these efforts draw toward a richer doctrine, notably toward the theory of Trinitarian ‘appropriations’. Expositing Bonaventure and Aquinas, Joseph Wawrykow underscores the centrality of Trinitarian theology for both theologians and highlights their areas of agreement as well as their distinctive features: Bonaventure puts the good and love at the heart of his account of God, and emphasizes the primacy of the Father; especially important in Aquinas’ teaching is his understanding of divine persons in terms of ‘subsistent relations’. Russell Friedman describes two distinct ways in the late thirteenth century of talking about the ‘constitution’ of the divine persons, one based on ‘relations’, the other on ‘emanations’. Friedman focuses especially on John Duns Scotus and sketches two important fourteenth-century developments: the denial that the Trinitarian mystery can be  <i class="calibre4">explained</i> in any significant sense, and innovations in Trinitarian logic. Byzantine theologies of the Trinity from the ninth through the fifteenth centuries are traced by Karl Christian Felmy. After attending briefly to liturgical hymnody and art, he explores the controversy over the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> with particular attention to the ninth-century Patriarch of Constantinople Photius. He also treats, less-known authors and the Trinitarian doctrine of Gregory Palamas, whose approach he shows to have similarities with that of Augustine except as regards the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> and the divine energies. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">4. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Reformation to the Twentieth Century</b> Our fourth section moves from the Reformers and the Baroque period to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These latter centuries are treated in seven essays, on the grounds that the influence of these centuries is decisive for much contemporary study of the Trinity. Scott Swain's study of the Reformers on the Trinity highlights their effort, in light  <b class="calibre3">(p. 8) </b>of the new exegetical modes arising with the Renaissance, to articulate Trinitarian doctrine biblically with a focus on the economy of salvation rather than on metaphysical or logical debates  <i class="calibre4">per se</i>, although the Reformers engaged in those too when Page 7 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary. Ulrich Lehner examines both Catholic and Protestant Trinitarian theology from 1550 to 1770, from the mystical visions of Ignatius of Loyola to the Augustinian approach of Jonathan Edwards. Lehner also attends to the growing variety of eclectic views and to the influence of anti-Trinitarian thinkers, beginning with Michael Servetus and Faustus Socinus. Cyril O’Regan examines how Immanuel Kant marginalizes Trinitarian doctrine, and he also explores the use made by G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Schelling (among others) of triadic dynamisms. Indebted to Jacob Boehme, Hegel rejects a tri-personal divinity in favour of a self-realizing triadic dynamic symbolized by the doctrine of the Trinity; the later Schelling argues for divine tri-personal agency (‘semi-Arian’ in its orientation) that is brought to completion in history. In his treatment of nineteenth-century Protestant thought, Samuel Powell shows that Friedrich Schleiermacher had a major impact through his view that traditional Trinitarian doctrine is abstracted from the experience of salvation, an impact reflected in Isaac Dorner's effort to develop a Trinitarian theology on the basis of analysis of the ethical or supreme good (indebted also to Kant) and in Johann von Hofmann's emphasis on the history of salvation (indebted also to Hegel). Aidan Nichols's exposition of nineteenth-century Catholic theology moves from the Roman scholasticism of Giovanni Perrone to the Tübingen School's emphasis on the Trinity's manifestation in history to Matthias Joseph Scheeben's creatively Augustinian approach to divine Persons and nature, with attention as well to lesser figures and to the mystical theology of Elizabeth of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Focusing on Karl Barth but also commenting on Jürgen Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, and Eberhard Jüngel, George Hunsinger credits Barth with placing the revelation of the Trinity at the foundation of his dogmatics and with insisting that God's attributes (in his unity) be thought through only in relation to prior Trinitarian and soteriological reflection. Vincent Holzer argues that Karl Rahner's and Hans Urs von Balthasar's Trinitarian theology arises from a more fully historical theology of grace derived from Maurice Blondel. Rahner and von Balthasar attempt to reintegrate the more abstract notion of the divine essence into the historical revelation of the Trinity, Rahner through the self-communication of God rooted in the gracious dynamism that is our created spiritual existence and von Balthasar through his Trinitarian dramatics in which the Son undergoes the wrath of the Father for us. Exploring contemporary Orthodox Trinitarian theology, Aristotle Papanikolaou highlights the influence of Sergius Bulgakov, Vladimir Lossky, and John Zizioulas. Bulgakov conceives of the Trinity in terms of the actualization, in the Holy Spirit, of the self-revelation of the Father in the Son—in which process the tri-hypostatic being of God is revealed as Sophia in eternal communion with humanity (the world's ‘sophianicity’). Lossky holds that the Trinity is revealed in the Incarnation of Christ, an ‘antinomic’ truth (the non-opposition of opposites) that requires, against both Bulgakov and scholasticism, an apophatic and mystical theology. In his theology of Trinitarian communion, Zizioulas adopts Lossky's emphasis on the monarchy of the Father and on personhood as freedom from the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 9) </b>limitations of nature, but distances himself from Lossky's apophaticism and neo-Palamite commitment to the essence/energies distinction. Fergus Kerr inquires into the surprisingly limited interactions of theologians with the analytic philosophy that has dominated English-speaking universities for the past half-century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">5. </b> <b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Dogmatics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The biblical and historical studies of the previous four sections make clear that Trinitarian reflection has consistently been at the centre of constructive Christian theology. What might contemporary Trinitarian dogmatics look like? The fifth section seeks to answer this question by treating, in order, the dogmatic place of the Trinity; the role of reflection on the divine unity and analogous naming in Trinitarian theology; the theology of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the Trinity, creation, and the human person; the Trinity and the sacramental Body of Christ; and deification. Kathryn Tanner shows that the dogmatic place of the Trinity arises in the early Church from reading the New Testament's testimony to the relationships and activities of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. What came to be authoritative Christian teaching about the Trinity involves the convergence of biblical interpretation and theological pressures fundamental to Christian concerns about salvation in Christ. Rudi te Velde notes that the notion of a ‘personal’ God is presently in crisis in the West, and he explores what it means to apply the notion of ‘person’ analogously to God, with particular attention to intra-Trinitarian relationship and to the creation of persons made for relationship with each other and God. Emmanuel Durand underscores the eschatological ultimacy of the Father, fecund source of the Son and Holy Spirit and first principle of all Trinitarian action  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>. This resituates the theology of Christ and of the Holy Spirit within the context of a Trinitarian and paternal theocentrism. Thomas Weinandy exhibits the Nicene affirmations that are central to all further teaching about the Son, and he explores the relationship between the divine Son and all those who are created and recreated in the image and likeness of the Son. Bruce Marshall underscores that a Trinitarian pneumatology treats primarily the identity of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit's distinctive work in creation and redemption. Regarding the first issue, he shows two alternatives: one, exemplified by Aquinas, finds the identity of the Spirit in his relation of origin to the Father and Son; the other, exemplified by Scotus, finds the Spirit's identity in his unique way of originating from the Father. The Spirit's place in the saving work of the Trinity lies especially in his immediate indwelling by grace. Risto Saarinen outlines some traditional and contemporary views of the human being as an image of God, and discusses the analogical relationships between the triune God and creation, focusing on the problem of avoiding anthropomorphism; in this light he examines contemporary theologies that seek to affirm ontological links between the Trinity and created realities. With ecumenical and interreligious conversations in view, Charles Morerod argues that the theology of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 10) </b>the Church requires first not an account of its visible structures but an account of how humans, through the missions of Christ and the Holy Spirit, come to share in the relationships of the divine Persons. Daniel Keating emphasizes that faith and the sacraments bring about real transformation through the indwelling of the Spirit and adoptive sonship in the Son, so that Christians already live in the Trinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">6. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Christian Life</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Keating's essay forms a bridge from the dogmatic to the practical import of the doctrine of the Trinity. This practical import is no modern discovery, as Geoffrey Wainwright shows by beginning his essay on the Trinity in liturgy and preaching with Basil the Great's Trinitarian doxology. Wainwright shows how doxologies, preaching, and hymnody developed to foster Christians’ worship in accordance with the Trinitarian and mediatorial patterns found in the New Testament. François Bœspflug examines the theology of Trinitarian images and distinguishes five periods in Trinitarian iconography, cataloguing a vast array of artistic representations whose peak occurs in the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanus Cessario depicts the moral life in terms of the creative Trinity and human participation, as the created image of God, in the eternal law—a participation that through grace (which brings forth not only the infused virtues but also the gifts of the Holy Spirit) becomes filial conformity to God the Trinity in truth and charity, whose glorious consummation is sketched in the beatitudes. Amy Laura Hall takes up Julian of Norwich's writings with a focus on Julian's context of the black plague and her insistence that in the Trinity all things will be well, a vision that inspires moral and physical solidarity with </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘contagious’ outsiders today. Weaving together the insights of such figures as Thomas Aquinas, John Owen, John Henry Newman, and Hans Urs von Balthasar, Francesca Murphy explores prayer as requiring the confluence of invocation and meditation, made possible in various forms (personal and liturgical) by real assent to God revealing himself in the humanity of Christ as the Mediator/intercessor/propitiator and inspiring us by his Spirit. Examining the Trinity and feminism, Nonna Verna Harrison argues that the use of feminine metaphors to describe God should not lead to a rejection or replacement of the names for the Trinity given in Scripture and Tradition, since divine paternity does not mean that the immaterial Father is male. The generation of the Son is a model for both human motherhood and fatherhood. The Son, incarnate in a woman's womb and as a man, redeems and sanctifies all humankind: like a mother and like a bridegroom, he enters into deep relationships of love with men and women alike. Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt critiques social Trinitarianism on the grounds that it grants too much to Kant's reduction of religion to the sphere of practical reason, and he goes on to show that the true political relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity consists in the fruitfulness of our participation in the Trinitarian life of God as it is revealed to us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 11) 7. </b> <b class="calibre3">Dialogues</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Does Trinitarian reflection play a significant role in ecumenical dialogue? Does it pose a hindrance or a help to interreligious dialogue and to engagement of postmodern culture? </p>
<p class="calibre1">David Fergusson shows how the agreement of Christians regarding the doctrine of the Trinity has stimulated efforts to extend this agreement to other areas of faith and practice (doctrinal, liturgical, and moral) informed by Trinitarian reflection. Fergusson also evaluates important contributions in this regard by George Lindbeck and Robert Jenson, among others. Examining Jewish-Christian dialogue regarding the doctrine of God, Ellen Page 10 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Charry explores two encounters that occurred during the patristic and medieval periods and two encounters that occurred in the past thirty years. While the former two encounters were hampered by Christian inability to articulate the doctrine of the Trinity, the latter two show signs of promise, in part because both the Jewish and the Christian participants share a debt to Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, and Abraham Heschel. Gavin D’Costa raises concerns about the approaches of Karl Rahner, Jacques Dupuis, and Raimundo Panikkar to the Trinity and non-Christian religions, and he instead argues for explicitly Trinitarian and Christological approaches to these religions in terms of  <i class="calibre4">praeparatio evangelica, semina Verbi</i>, and  <i class="calibre4">vestigia Trinitatis</i>. Building upon recent critiques of modernity from theologians such as John Milbank and David Schindler, Tracey Rowland proposes that Trinitarian love infuses culture with a self-giving and teleological order that overcomes the ongoing mechanization and monetization of culture. An example of this renewal through self-giving love can be found in Pope John Paul II's theology of marriage and the family. Lastly, by way of conclusion, the editors of this volume present some brief Prospects for Trinitarian Theology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article traces the history of the canonization of the Scripture in the context of Trinitarian doctrine. It presents a series of four vignettes illustrative of how early Christian interpretations of the fact and contents of the scriptural canon were determinative of its Trinitarian faith. These include the works of Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Athanasius, and Augustine. It shows that the fluidity of the canon in the first centuries does not appear to have affected Trinitarian doctrine but the development of the notion of canonicity itself speaks to the understanding of revelation at work in the development of Trinitarian doctrine. It also suggests that the canon of Scripture provides certain norms that shaped the development of Trinitarian doctrine, such as the identity of the God of the Old Testament with the God of the New, the rule of faith as an interpretive key and the Christological reading of Scripture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian doctrine, Scripture, canonization, scriptural canon, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Athanasius, Augustine, God, Old Testament CHRISTIAN faith purports to be an assent to divine revelation and posits a collection of writings, the Scriptures (or ‘books’; in Greek,  <i class="calibre4">biblia</i>), as authoritative witnesses to this revelation. These books are considered to provide a norm or rule ( <i class="calibre4">kanōn</i>) for discerning the contents and interpretation of divine revelation. The mere fact of a canon, whose contents are determined or at least recognized by the community of Christian believers, delineates a nexus of relations between the notions of revelation, Scripture, tradition, and Church. The primary units of the contents of the Christian canon are the Old and New Testaments. The early Christian recognition of the Hebrew Scriptures as integral to the content of Christian revelation, already implicit in New Testament references to Old Testament texts, was confirmed in reaction to Marcion in the mid-second century. Marcion differentiated the God of the Jewish Scriptures, whom he considered to be an inferior creator God, from the God of Jesus Christ. He created his own canon which was comprised of only one gospel, an abridged version of the Gospel of Luke, and ten Pauline epistles. The Page 1 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> excommunication of Marcion in the mid 140s indicated the Church's acceptance of what came to be called the Old Testament, though there was some fluidity in recourse to the books that have subsequently been distinguished as canonical, deutero-canonical, and apocryphal. The present differences between the shorter Protestant OT canon and the longer Catholic and Orthodox canons with respect to the ‘deutero-canonical’ books of Tobith, Judith, 1–2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, and added parts of Esther and Daniel, indicate a range that is already in evidence in the early Church. In the last third of the second century, Melito of Sardis referred to the Hebrew Scriptures as the ‘Old Testament’ and listed a canon that is identical with the Jewish canon of the time, except for the omission of Esther. By the end of the first century, New Testament books, especially the gospels and Pauline epistles, were de facto used as authoritative  <b class="calibre3">(p. 16) </b>Scripture in the life of the Church, as attested by such sources as  <i class="calibre4">Didache, 1 and 2 Clement</i>, and the epistles of Ignatius of Antioch. There was a degree of variability in the acceptance of other NT books, principally in terms of hesitations in the West with respect to Hebrews and in the East about Revelation. The terms ‘Old Testament’ and ‘New Testament’ were first used by Irenaeus,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.180 ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. IV,28,1–2), who also insisted, against the prevalence of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gnostic’ gospels, that only the four gospels are authoritative. In the late fourth century, Athanasius’ Easter letter to his diocese,  <i class="calibre4">Festal Letter</i> 39, includes a list of the books of the New Testament that is identical in content and order with the 27 books now universally accepted by the Christian Churches. For Catholics, a final dogmatic determination of the contents of the canon was promulgated at the Council of Trent in 1546, which included the OT ‘deutero-canonical’ books. Protestants opted for the shorter OT canon during the Reformation. The Greek Orthodox Churches added to the longer Catholic OT canon  <i class="calibre4">2 Esdras</i> and  <i class="calibre4">3 Maccabees</i>, while there has been a notable tendency in the Russian Orthodox Churches since the nineteenth century to prefer the shorter OT canon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It may be safely asserted that the fluidity with respect to the material contents of the Scriptural canon in the early centuries, principally in reference to the choice between a shorter and longer canon in the Old Testament, and Hebrews and Revelation in the New Testament, was not a factor in the development of Trinitarian doctrine. That is to say, we do not find any instances from the early Church where questions that could later be categorized under the rubric of ‘Trinitarian theology’ revolved specifically around disagreements as to whether a particular text at issue was canonical. Nevertheless, an enquiry into ‘the canonization of Scripture in the context of Trinitarian doctrine’ can be profitably conducted under at least three aspects: how the very notion of canonicity grounds claims of Trinitarian faith to be revealed truth; how the contents of Trinitarian doctrine are configured in relation to the principal structural shape of the Christian canon as comprised of the Old and New Testaments; and how certain rules were devised, at once doctrinal and exegetical, to achieve coherence amid seeming tensions within the canon in order to achieve a properly Trinitarian reading of Scripture. Clearly, a comprehensive analysis of these questions would open up into an investigation of the whole practice of Christian exegesis as it relates to Christological and Trinitarian questions. The present essay, however, will be confined to sketching a series of four vignettes, in chronological order, illustra</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> In the second century, Justin Martyr provided an account of how the interrelation of the Old and New Testaments delineates a Christological narrative that in turn provides a Trinitarian identification of the God of Israel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> Later in the same century, Irenaeus insisted on the nexus of Revelation, Scripture, Tradition, and Church as the indispensible foundation for the Trinitarian rule of faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> In the Trinitarian controversies of the fourth century, differences were voiced not with respect to the material contents of the canon but rather in terms of its overall Christological shape or ‘ <i class="calibre4">skopos</i>’, and Athanasius articulated the Christological- <b class="calibre3">(p. 17)</b> exegetical regulation of the diverse contents of the canon which supported a Nicene interpretation of Scripture. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> Finally, in the early fifth century, Augustine presented his own reading of the fundamental shape of the Christian canon as presenting the salvific working of the Triune God in terms of Law and grace: the revelation of the Law in the Old Testament which is fulfilled by the indwelling of Christ and the outpouring of the Spirit in the New. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Justin Martyr</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Justin Martyr explicitly rejected the teaching of Marcion, quoted liberally from the Old Testament, and referred to ‘the apostles’ memoirs, which are called gospels’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 66), as well as to the major Pauline epistles and Revelation. Twentieth-century scholarship, somewhat under the spell of Adolf Harnack's preoccupation with the Hellenization of the gospel, has tended to portray Justin's theology as centrally revolving around a Middle Platonic conception of ‘ <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>’. But it is legitimate to see Justin's Trinitarian theology from a different point of view, as arising out of a global reading of the Christian canon that constructs what some strains of modern theology refer to as ‘a narrative identification of the Trinity’. In defence of the Christian faith against both pagan and Jewish critiques, Justin Martyr is concerned in both cases with presenting the Christian message as bearing an organic unity to that of the Hebrew Scriptures. In his  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i>, he addresses the objection that the Christian message is devoid of the authority of antiquity by constructing a coherent narrative that ties together the Old and New Testaments in witness to Christ. In the  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i>, he rebuts the objection that Christian teaching violates the Hebrew Scriptures’ witness to the one God, by insisting that the God of Israel has been further identified as having an ineffable relation to the pre-existent divinity of Jesus Christ. In both cases, Justin configures the central structural shape of the Christian canon, the interrelation of the Old and New Testaments, as a Christological narrative leading to a Trinitarian identification of God. This narrative provides a Trinitarian elaboration of the soteriological theme of ‘Christus Victor’: the reign of the God of Israel is fulfilled through the crucified and risen Christ. It is Christ's victorious fulfilment of Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> God's plan of salvation which reveals a dialogue within the divine and thus a Trinitarian conception of God. The Scriptures, which give witness to this revelation, were composed ultimately through the agency of the divine Word and the ‘prophetic Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 36, 51). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i>, Justin explains that it is the divine  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> who speaks through the scriptural writers according to various  <i class="calibre4">personas</i>: ‘sometimes … in the  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> of God the Master and Father of all, sometimes in the  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> of Christ, sometimes in the <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> of the people responding to the Lord or to his Father’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 36). The <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> of the Father is scripturally identified in terms of his being Creator of the world and  <b class="calibre3">(p. 18) </b>the God of Israel. When Justin gives examples of scriptural texts spoken in the <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> of Christ, all of them are understood as referring directly to the crucifixion. His citations of texts that were spoken in the  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> of the people are variations on the themes represented in his first scriptural example, from Mic. 4:2–3/Isa. 2:3–4: ‘For the law will go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and he shall judge in the midst of the nations and rebuke the peoples; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 39). We can identify these themes as first, the extension of God's covenantal relationship from Israel to all people; secondly, the universal reign of God through Christ; and, third, the manifestation of God's reign in the reformed lives of the gentiles who have followed Christ. Taken together, Justin's identification of the different scriptural  <i class="calibre4">personas</i> of God, Christ, and the people thus form a narrative that determines his presentation of the divinity of Christ. According to this narrative, Christ's divinity is manifest in the fact that gentiles from every race have embraced the God of Israel through Christ and embody the character of God's kingdom in their lives. This narrative is intended to demonstrate that, while distinct from the God of Israel, ‘the one who suffered these things has an ineffable origin and reigns over his enemies’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 51). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> offers an even more transparent presentation of how Justin's Christological narrative, comprising the Old and New Testaments, determines his account of the scriptural identification of God as Trinity. In this instance, Justin is clearly concerned to show that Jews and Christians believe in the same God. As in the  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i>, Justin characterizes this God as both Creator of the universe and God of Israel. On the basis of this agreement with his Jewish interlocutor, Justin proceeds to a demonstration that God's plan of salvation has come to fulfilment only through Jesus Christ. This fulfilment has two interrelated aspects in Justin's account: first, whereas the old covenant was comprised of ‘elementary precepts’ designed to wean the Israelites from idolatry but was powerless against sin and death, Jesus established a new covenant which accomplishes a deliverance from sin and death and a circumcision of the heart. This new covenant corresponds to the universal and eternal precepts of humanity's proper relation to God. The second aspect of the fulfilment of God's plan of salvation is the extension of God's covenantal favour to the gentiles. The turning of the gentiles to the God of Israel through the name of Jesus demonstrates that Jesus is the Messiah: ‘If all the nations are blessed in the Christ and we who are from all the nations believe in him, then he is the Christ’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 121:1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> Having established that Jesus is the Messiah who brings to fulfilment the victorious reign and universal manifestation of God, Justin can then assume that premise as the basis for claiming that all previous manifestations of divine presence should be assimilated to the identity of Jesus. Moreover, the dialogical relation between the human Jesus and the Father, which Justin typically characterizes in terms of Jesus’ complete obedience to the Father's will, is read back into the titles of the pre-existent Christ. Among these titles is the characterization of Jesus as  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>, in connection with the scriptural  <i class="calibre4">persona</i> of Wisdom/ <i class="calibre4">Sophia</i>. There is a certain dialogical personalism that is integral to the relation between God and the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>, as would be expected given that Justin's line of argument begins with the  <i class="calibre4">persona</i> of the victorious Messiah who is obedient to the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 19) </b>Father's will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, Justin explains that the pre-existent Christ derives all his titles, including  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> and <i class="calibre4">Sophia</i>, ‘from the fact that he ministers to the Father's will and was begotten by the will of the Father’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 61:1). Rather than merely God's speech or functional reason,  <i class="calibre4">Sophia/Logos</i> is someone to whom God speaks; in the act of creation God ‘conversed with one who was endowed with rationality and numerically other than himself … </p>
<p class="calibre1">This offspring, who was really brought forth from the Father, was with the Father before all creatures and the Father conversed with him’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 62:2,4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Justin thus resolves the fundamental structural components of the Christian canon, the Old and New Testaments, into a coherent Christological narrative that identifies Jesus as the one whose suffering has ushered in the reign of God, overcoming sin and death by his redemptive suffering, bringing about the demise of the demons who have ruled over the nations, and allowing the nations to enter into God's covenantal embrace. Consistently with this narrative, Christ's divinity is largely associated by Justin with biblical motifs of the God who reigns over his enemies and who manifests himself in a universal and all-encompassing manner. This characterization is combined with an emphasis on Jesus’ obedience to the Father in a way that allows Justin to read a dialogical relation into the very structure of divine self-manifestation. While Justin's primary characterization of the Spirit is as the ‘prophetic Spirit’ which inspires Scripture, there is also an important role for the Spirit in Justin's ‘ <i class="calibre4">Christus Victor</i>’ Christological narrative. As we have noted, this narrative points to the reign of God over the gentiles, which has come about through the name of Jesus and the power of his salvific passion, as testimony that Jesus is indeed the divine Christ. But, according to Justin, this victory of God's reign is actualized and manifested through the ‘gifts of the Spirit’, which are the fruits of Christ's passion and resurrection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Church's holiness, which is comprised of the gifts of the Spirit, ‘is derived from the Father himself through the crucified one’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 110:3). We can say, finally, that Justin's Christological narrative comes to the point of fully disclosing the Trinity in his representation of the Church. While Justin Martyr does not make explicit reference to the category of canonicity and does not provide us with a list of biblical books that he considered canonical, he constructs a Christological narrative that identifies Father, Son, and Holy Spirit out of the material that we identify as Old and New Testaments, the basic structural components of the Christian canon. He thus provides us with an account of the fundamental canonical shape of an early Trinitarian theology. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> <b class="calibre3">Irenaeus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Later in the second century, the prevalence of ‘Gnostic’ movements provoked a theological response from Irenaeus, the bishop of Lyons, that included a more explicit reflection on how divine revelation, as announced through the Trinitarian rule of faith, is received by the Church through the Scriptures and authoritatively proclaimed. The various movements offering a salvific secret ‘knowledge’ ( <i class="calibre4">gnosis</i>) expressed their teachings in documents that  <b class="calibre3">(p. 20) </b>did not come to be included in the Christian canon, rejected much of what was later to be included in the New Testament canon, and depicted the Old Testament ‘god of the Jews’, as a rogue deity. The Christological-Trinitarian narrative that Justin Martyr had constructed out of the combination of the Hebrew Scriptures and what later came to be called ‘New Testament’ writings was thus effectively dismantled and replaced by an elaborate account that typically pitted the authentic divine realm, the  <i class="calibre4">pleroma</i>, against the creator-god of this world. While these systems of ‘ <i class="calibre4">gnosis</i>’ often included the names of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in their descriptions of the divine  <i class="calibre4">pleroma</i>, they were clearly not reducible to a Trinitarian narrative identification of God in the way that Justin's account was. For example, Basilides, one of the principal teachers of ‘ <i class="calibre4">gnosis</i>’ with whom Irenaeus was polemically engaged, described the  <i class="calibre4">pleroma</i> as constituted by a series of emanations beginning with the unbegotten Father, from whom is born Mind, from whom is born Word ( <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>), followed by Forethought, Wisdom, Power, etc., until we reach the number of the solar year, 365. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irenaeus, by contrast, accepted the Hebrew Scriptures, in the  <i class="calibre4">Septuagint</i> translation, as an authentic Christian book. He refers to ‘the gospel’ as delivered ‘fourfold in perspective but bound together by one Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,11,8) and cites almost all of the books that would later be included in the New Testament canon (excluding Philemon, 2 Peter, 3 John, and Jude). Irenaeus is a witness to the still fluid state of the canon at this stage, inasmuch as he imputes scriptural authority to some writings that would not be part of the New Testament canon, such as  <i class="calibre4">Shepherd of Hermas</i> and  <i class="calibre4">1 Clement</i> ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,3,3; IV,20,2). As with Justin Martyr, Irenaeus constructs out of the combination of the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament writings a coherent Christological narrative that delineates the Trinitarian shape of Christian confession. In his  <i class="calibre4">Proof of the Apostolic Preaching</i>, Irenaeus presents ‘the first and foremost article of our faith’ as belief in ‘the Father … maker of all’, who is addressed elsewhere as ‘the Lord God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob and Israel, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ’ ( <i class="calibre4">Proof of the Apostolic</i> <i class="calibre4">Preaching</i> 6;  <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,6,4); the second article is belief in Jesus Christ as the consummation and fulfilment of the prophetic witness of the Hebrew Scriptures and the ‘recapitulation’ of human reality and history in a mode that restores it to communion with God; and the third article is belief in the Holy Spirit, through whom the prophets and patriarchs of the Hebrew Scriptures were taught and who, in fulfilment of prophecy, has been poured out ‘in a new way upon humanity throughout all the earth, renewing it to God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Proof of</i> <i class="calibre4">the Apostolic Preaching</i> 6; Smith 1952: 51). Also similarly to Justin, the Trinitarian activity is formative of the scriptural witness: ‘So the Spirit manifests the Word and therefore the prophets announced the Son of God, but the Word articulates the Spirit and therefore Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> it is he himself who gives their message to the prophets and takes up humanity and brings it to the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Proof of the Apostolic Preaching</i> 5; Smith 1952: 51). Irenaeus’ account of Christ's restorative recapitulation of humanity's broken relation to God also recalls the principal events of the Old Testament as finding their consummation in the fulfilment of the eschatological call to the gentiles through the Church. Humanity as a whole is thus offered the opportunity to be ‘adopted’ in Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘presented’ to the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 21) </b>The distinctive contribution of Irenaeus is his explicit consideration of how the Church's Trinitarian confession of faith is properly safeguarded only through asserting a series of strict continuities between Revelation, Scripture, Tradition, and Church. In his <i class="calibre4">Against Heresies</i>, Irenaeus follows his first two books in which he described and criticized Gnostic systems with a promise at the beginning of Book 3 to ‘add proofs from the scriptures’. Irenaeus’ subsequent explication of the structure of scriptural authority offers a sophisticated reflection on canonicity, as both enabling the material resources for the Church's Trinitarian confession and as itself constituted by the presence and activity of Father, Son, and Spirit. Significantly, Irenaeus begins his account of scriptural authority not with the Hebrew Scriptures but directly with what he calls ‘the gospel of God’, which is also to be identified with ‘the economy of our salvation’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,1,1). The </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘gospel of God’ provides humanity with ‘the truth, that is the doctrine of the Son of God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III, pref.), and begins with the ‘perfect knowledge ( <i class="calibre4">gnosis</i>)’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,1,1) of the apostles, which is itself enabled by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Acts 1:8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This unified gospel is refracted into the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, each representing a distinct aspect of the mystery of Christ; thus, John presents the Word's ‘glorious generation from the Father’; Luke, ‘Jesus’ priestly character’; Matthew, his ‘human generation’; and Mark presents Jesus as the fulfilment of the prophetic witness. Beyond the continuity between the truth communicated by the Holy Spirit and the scriptural writings, Irenaeus insists on a further continuity between the scriptural writings and the concrete tradition transmitted through apostolic succession in the Churches, such that ‘there is one and the same life-giving faith, preserved and transmitted in truth from the apostles up till now in the Church’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,3,3). Throughout his anti-gnostic polemic, Irenaeus presents ‘false  <i class="calibre4">gnosis</i>’ as radically divisive in its view of reality: dividing the ‘true god’ from the creator-god and thus from creation; separating ‘true knowledge’ from the scriptural witness; severing the scriptures from the witness of tradition embodied in the Church; and sundering the earthly Jesus from the Christ who descends from the  <i class="calibre4">pleroma</i>. In contrast, he presents Christian truth as ‘a single ascending path’ ( <i class="calibre4">Proof of the Apostolic Preaching</i> 1) comprised of a series of strict unities: the true God is the creator who desires union with his creation, a union accomplished by the salvific work of the one Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, who are themselves immediately united to the Father as his ‘two hands’; and this Trinitarian economy of salvation is attested in Scripture, tradition, and Church. A sense of canonicity, not in terms of a defined list of books but rather as the intrinsic bond between the authority of the Scriptures and the Church's access to salvific truth, is central to Irenaeus’ vision of true  <i class="calibre4">gnosis</i>: Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> True Gnosis consists of the teaching of the apostles, and the ancient constitution of the church throughout the whole world, and the distinctive mark of the body of Christ in accordance with the succession of bishops, by whom the apostles have transmitted the church in every place as it has reached us, being guarded by unadulterated Scriptures, a complete systemic whole, subject to neither addition nor subtraction. (Irenaeus,  <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. IV,33,8)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 22) Athanasius</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely the most tumultuous and fateful period in the development of Trinitarian doctrine was the controversy that erupted between Arius and his bishop, Alexander, in Egypt in the second decade of the fourth century and came to some decisive resolution only with the Council of Constantinople in 381. The controversy originally revolved around the question of whether the divinity of Jesus Christ, as Word and Son, was a created secondary deity or coeternal with the Father, and subsequently posed similar questions about whether the Spirit was fully divine or a creature of the Son. Athanasius, the successor of Alexander to the see of Alexandria in 328, had a clear sense of the notion of canon and, as we noted at the beginning of this article, was able to identify a list of canonical Old and New Testament books, the latter identical with later authoritative lists in the main Christian churches. Athanasius asserts the distinction between what he considers to be the genuine contents of the Old and New Testaments and ‘apocrypha’. His list of Old Testament books, based on the Septuagint, is intermediate between the Jewish canon and the longer canons now accepted by Roman Catholics and by Orthodox. Baruch, Lamentations, and the Epistle of Jeremiah are included, while the Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Sirach, Esther, Judith, Tobit,  <i class="calibre4">the Didache</i>, and the  <i class="calibre4">Shepherd of Hermas</i> are listed not as part of the canon but as recommended reading for catechumens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At no point in the controversy surrounding the Council of Nicaea do we get any indication that Arius—or any of those theologians who took issue with the Nicene description of the Son as ‘ <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>’ with the Father—referred the controverted issues to questions about the contents of the canon. What we do find, however, is that there was fundamental disagreement about the overall Christological narrative shape of the canon. At the outset of the controversy, we have a letter from Alexander complaining that Arius and his supporters use passages that advert to the human lowliness of Jesus Christ as evidence of his secondary divinity, while ignoring those passages that evoke his majesty and intimacy with the Father. The former set of passages included both his human limitations (hunger, thirst, not knowing the hour of the Day of Judgement) and statements that seemed to posit the glorification of Jesus to an exalted status as a consequence of his human obedience, such as Phil. 2:8–9: ‘Being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name’. Thus, the point of issue was the regulation of tensions within the canon so as to render a unified and harmonious reading. In modern discussions of canonicity, this issue is sometimes dealt with by proposing the ne</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> cessity of a ‘canon within the canon’. Such a stratagem would impose a certain theological consistency upon the putative diversity within the canon by asserting one canonical perspective to be primary and central while relegating other strata to secondary or peripheral status. Alternatively, the diversity of New Testament accounts  <b class="calibre3">(p. 23) </b>of Christ is sometimes posited as a canonical endorsement of a plurality of Christological options. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in the crucial instance of the exegetical difficulties and disagreements surrounding Nicene doctrine, what emerged was neither ‘a canon within the canon’ nor a recognition of a variety of options for identifying the person of Christ but a Christological rule ( <i class="calibre4">kanōn</i>) derived from within the canon and understood to be a reflection of the Christological shape of the canon as a whole and not the privileging of one part of the canon over another. This Christological rule is articulated by Athanasius in the third book of his <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i>, written in the late 340s. He writes, Therefore the scope ( <i class="calibre4">skopos</i>) and characteristic feature ( <i class="calibre4">charactēr</i>) of the holy Scripture, as we have often said, is its twofold proclamation of the Saviour: that he was always God and Son, as being the Father's Word, Radiance, and Wisdom, and that afterwards he took flesh from Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, for our sake, and became a human being. One can find this indicated throughout the entire divinely inspired Scripture, as the Lord himself has said: ‘Search the Scriptures, for it is they which testify to me’ (Jn 5:39) (Athanasius,  <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i> 3:29). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Athanasius goes on to show how this ‘twofold proclamation of the Saviour’, which functions as a key to interpreting the coherence of the canon as a whole, is derived from specific texts within the canon, such as the double proclamation in the  <i class="calibre4">Prologue</i> of the Gospel of John (Jn 1:1, ‘In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God’; and Jn 1:14, ‘And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us’) and that of the Christological hymn of Phil. 2 (‘being in the form of God’; ‘taking the form of a servant’). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Athanasius, this twofold proclamation delineates a Christological narrative that is distinct from the competing ‘Arian’ narrative. Both narratives have to deal with the twofold aspects of Christ's humiliation and exaltation. However, the ‘Arian’ organization of this content posits the pre-existent Christ as a creature whose exaltation to divine status was granted by the one God proleptically as a consequence of the foreseen merits of his human obedience. Athanasius’ interpretation insisted that the overall Christological shape of the canon, as read out of particular texts such as those cited above, was one of kenotic descent on the part of the fully divine Word and Son resulting in the exaltation of human beings through the exalted humanity of Christ: ‘And if he descended to accomplish the grace of [humanity's] advancement, then he did not come to be called “Son” and “God” as a reward, but rather he himself made us sons for the Father and divinized human beings when he himself became a human being’ ( <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i> 1:38; Anatolios 2004: 96); ‘He did not become greater, as one who was lesser, but, rather being God, “he took the form of the servant” and in the taking of it, he was not advanced but rather humbled himself’ ( <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i> 1:40; Anatolios 2004: 97). In this narrative of Christological divine descent–human ascent, the Holy Spirit is given through the divinity Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> of Christ and received through his humanity. The net effect of this transaction is the definitive and ‘secure’ salvation of human beings: But through whom and from whom should the Spirit have been given, if not through the Son whose Spirit it is? And, then again, when were we empowered to receive, if not  <b class="calibre3">(p. 24) </b>when the Word became a human being? … In no other way would we have partaken of the Spirit and been sanctified if it were not that the Giver of the Spirit, the Word himself, spoke of himself as anointed by the Spirit for our sakes. Therefore we have received in that he is said to be anointed in the flesh. The flesh was first sanctified in him and he is spoken of as having received through it, as a human being, and so we have the Spirit's grace that follows from his reception, receiving from his fullness. (Athanasius,  <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i> 1:50; Anatolios 2004: 108)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Augustine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early fifth century, Augustine refers to the scriptural canon in his instructions for Scriptural interpretation in  <i class="calibre4">de doctrina christiana</i>, and lists 44 books of the Old Testament (the longer canon minus Sirach and Baruch) and 27 books of the New Testament as </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘authoritative’ ( <i class="calibre4">terminatur auctoritas</i>). He adverts to some degree of fluidity in the determination of the canon and advises the interpreter to settle questions of canon on ecclesiological grounds: With regard to the canonical Scriptures, one should defer to the authority of the majority of Catholic Churches, certainly including among them those that were deemed worthy of having apostolic seats and to accept apostolic letters. The criterion to be applied to the canonical scriptures is that those that are accepted by all the churches are to be preferred to those which are not accepted by some. As to those that are not accepted by all, one should give precedence to those accepted by the majority of churches and churches of greater authority over those held by the minority of churches or churches of lesser authority. (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">On Christian</i> <i class="calibre4">Doctrine</i> 8:12)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Justin Martyr, Augustine also sees the fundamental narrative content of the Christian canon as the extension of covenantal grace from ‘the Patriarchs and prophets’ to the nations ( <i class="calibre4">On the Instruction of Beginners</i> 39) and, like Athanasius, he considers that the essential rule for configuring the coherence of the scriptural canon is provided by such texts as Phil. 2:6, which adverts to the kenotic descent of the Word from the ‘form of God’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the ‘form of the servant’. The violation of this rule for ordering the contents of the canon was the foundational error of scriptural interpretation that violates orthodox Trinitarian faith: People who have been less diligent in their investigation and consideration of the whole arrangement of the Scriptures ( <i class="calibre4">universam seriem scripturarum</i>) have erred Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> in trying to transfer the things said of Jesus Christ as a human being to his substance that was eternal before the incarnation and is eternal. ( <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> 1:14) A more distinctly Augustinian contribution to the Trinitarian shape of the canon is found in his anti-Pelagian polemic, when he relates the Old and New Testaments according to the Pauline dialectic of law and grace, as found in  <i class="calibre4">Romans</i>. Over against what Augustine considered to be Pelagian understandings of divine grace as constituted  <b class="calibre3">(p. 25) </b>by revelation and teaching, Augustine insists that the essential content of the ‘grace of Jesus Christ’ communicated by the gospel is that the revelation of the divine will for humanity in the Old Testament is fulfilled by the enabling of the human will to conform to that divine will through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the descent of the Holy Spirit. In this framework, the essential content of the Old Testament is the ‘law’ of divine teaching which not only enlightens human beings with respect to the reality and purposes of God but humbles human pride by manifesting humanity's pervasive and structural incapacity to respond appropriately to the divine will. In this way, ‘the letter kills’, inasmuch as it manifests humanity's entrapment in the death of estrangement from God. But this same law is also the handmaid of grace inasmuch as it prepares humanity to recognize and receive and be appropriately thankful for the deliverance worked by Jesus Christ and the Spirit in the ‘fullness of time’. The essential content of this deliverance is delineated according to a Trinitarian pattern. The righteousness of God is enacted by Jesus Christ through his death and resurrection, bringing about ‘the renewal of righteousness’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Spirit and the Letter</i> 10), which involves not merely the doing of the divine will but the delight in and love for God that is only effected by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as ‘the love of God which is poured into our hearts’ (Rom. 5:5). The faithful acceptance and participation in this righteousness of Christ leads to the full vision of Christ ‘in the form of God in which he is equal to the Father’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Spirit and the Letter</i> 37). Augustine thus reads the fundamental OT–NT dialectic of the Christian canon in terms of a narrative which sees the economy of salvation as progressing from divine teaching in the Old Testament to the indwelling of the Trinity in the faithful believer through the New Testament revelation. While the salvific economy of the New Testament thus brings to Trinitarian fulfilment the divine disclosure in the Old Testament, the latter still has a certain precedence as the point of departure and frame of enclosure for the Christian narrative: Many will come from the East and the West and will feast not with Plato and Cicero but ‘with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven’ (Matt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8:11) … All the Gentiles believe in the King of the Jews. He rules over all the Gentiles but He is still King of the Jews. The trunk is sturdy enough to transform the engrafted olive tree into itself, but the wild olive cannot usurp the name of the olive tree. ( <i class="calibre4">Sermon</i> 218:7)</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a><b class="calibre3">The Canonization of Scripture in the Context of Trinitarian Doctrine</b> <b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We noted at the beginning of this article that the articulation of the Church's Trinitarian faith did not explicitly intersect with disagreements as to the content of the canon. Nevertheless, the fact of the canon, and the strategies for reading the interrelation of its structural components of the Old and New Testaments, positively determined the contours of this faith in ways that are perennially relevant for the project of its appropriation. Irenaeus insisted that the rule of faith, in its Trinitarian form, must be received as  <b class="calibre3">(p. 26)</b> grounded in the confession of a strict continuity between divine revelation, the Scriptures, and the Church. Earlier, Justin Martyr had posited the continuity of the Old and New Testaments in the construction of a Christological narrative which includes a Trinitarian identification of the God of Israel. The victory of the God of Israel is achieved through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which extends covenantal grace to the gentiles through the gifts of the Spirit in the Church, the same Spirit that inspired the prophetic witness to Christ in the Old Testament. In the fifth century, Augustine presented a complementary account of the unity of the two Testaments in which the law of divine teaching in the Old Testament leads to the grace of Trinitarian indwelling in the New. The Trinitarian identification of God through the Christian canon also required the construction of a Christological rule encompassing the entire contents of the canonical witness, by which the various scriptural presentations of Christ may be organized by referring them respectively to his divinity and his humanity, ‘the twofold proclamation of the Saviour’ in Athanasius’ terms. The appropriation of orthodox Trinitarian faith will always necessarily include an affirmation of the scriptural canon as mediating authentic revelation to the Church which exists in continuity with the apostolic witness. It will also involve the construal of the primary components of the Christian canon, the Old and New Testaments, as comprising a Christological narrative that prescribes a Trinitarian identification of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An orthodox Trinitarian interpretation of that narrative will also finally require the assertion of a Christological regulation of the canon that issues in the double proclamation of the divinity and humanity of Christ and the communication of the Spirit through the interactivity of Christ's humanity and divinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article analyzes the concept of the Trinity in the Old Testament. It discusses the history-of-religions approach which correlates certain developments within Israel's worship of one God with what Christians identified as distinct hypostases in God and proposes an alternative approach which involves recognizing that descriptions of Israel's God may have not only a referent within ancient Israel but also a further divinely intended referent. It concludes that the Trinity in the Old Testament is not an invitation to search for threesomes in the scriptures of Israel, but instead is tied up with a proper understanding and confession about how the literal sense speaks of its divine referent. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Considerations</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE idea of a ‘Trinity in the Old Testament’ will strike most in the present period as anachronistic and an inaccurate handling of the Old Testament's literal sense and historical integrity. At most, it would mean an undertaking to describe the kind of religious frame of reference, in terms of the depictions of God at home in the scriptures of Israel, that manifests a potential for later theological descriptions in Christian hands. Angels, the divine council, curious accounts of hidden divine action (as with the men/angels in the story of Sodom), David as ‘son of God’, the ‘let us’ of Creation, or the ‘one like a Son of Man’ in Daniel's fiery furnace—these and other accounts would have to be correlated with what we know of Israelite religion in its ancient near eastern context and held to be, from the modern perspective, capable of explanation as adumbrations of something like Trinitarian conceptuality, albeit in crude and imprecise form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This history-of-religion undertaking must work carefully (if for some, unpersuasively) in order to guard the historicality of the Old Testament witness, at the same time endeavouring to show that the God of Israel, in the light of a dynamic life with a people, is related to the world and the covenanted Israel in ways that find religious correlation with the later views of Christian faith, when it comes to the Doctrine of the Trinity. The economic life of God with the people of the Old Covenant, as expressed in the literal/historical sense of the Old Testament witness, would have to be preserved, such that the ontological claims of the later witness would not materially adjust that economic depiction, except as this might be shown to have some religious potential for future reference. Here, ironically, the fact that Israel worshipped one God and not many created the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 29) </b>dynamic necessity of relationship through a variety of media (prophetic word, angelic vocation, cultic presence, creational co-work, divine presence in affliction, sonship) if God was to be truly transcendent and holy and present and active, all in one selfsame Deity. That is, the non-polytheistic eccentricity of this One God of Israel led to the development of a religious lexicon for expressing his ‘hypostases’ in the life of Israel, with the character of economic foreshadowings of later Christian formulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the modern period, this effort to clear the ground for a Trinitarian adumbration within the economic life of God in the Old Covenant is not frequently pursued, though it has been undertaken on occasion from the side of New Testament reflection (Hurtado 2003; Viviano 1998). This reticence is tied up with a concern to honour the historical context of the Old Testament and its ‘literal sense’ depictions, and not to extrude into that world the conceptualities and theological convictions of a later period (on the possibility of a philosophical disconnection between a text's judgements and a text's conceptuality, see Yeago 1994). </p>
<p class="calibre1">At issue, then, more broadly speaking, is just what is meant by the Old Testament's ‘literal sense’ as well as what is meant by ‘history’ and ‘historical context’—words which in the present period may seem enticingly univocal, but which were by no means taken to be such at earlier periods of the history of biblical interpretation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the purpose of introduction, consider an alternative way of thinking about the Trinity in the Old Testament. Here it would be held that certain expressions in the literal sense—</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning, light, word, first of ways, wisdom, son—themselves could not refer univocally to a single referent. That is, the literal sense of the Old Testament had an historically determined meaning at one level—it made sense to an audience in time and space within Israel's ancient referentiality—but pointed as well to a further reference. This sense of multiple reference does not evacuate the historicality of the witness nor the meaningfulness and intelligibility of the economic activity of One God. Rather, it evolves from an awareness that the subject matter being vouchsafed is richer than a single intentionality in time can measure. If this is so, a history-of-religion account of the economic life of God can only get one so far, and indeed, it could misunderstand the character of the literal sense and how it is to be appreciated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">To say, for example, that the wisdom referred to as the first of God's ways, in Prov. 8:22, refers to a specific set of Israelite beliefs about God and his character (call it ‘wisdom theology’) only begs the question, but what exactly is this ‘theology of wisdom’ from the standpoint of God's own working and self ? Or, to say that the ‘let us make man in our own image’ does not have as it subject matter ‘the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit’ is nevertheless to ask, why such a plurality at all and just who is this ‘we’? ‘God in the divine council’, one will respond. But what is this ‘divine council’ ultimately and why does God speak in his own single voice as ‘we’? Similarly, what does the collocation of word, spirit, beginning, and God ( <i class="calibre4">’elohim</i>) mean when the Bible begins its narrative (Gen. 1:1–</p>
<p class="calibre1">3)? To answer with a source-critical description of the work or intention of an author (‘the Priestly Writer’) is to restrict the scope of the enquiry artificially, it could be held. Equally, to ignore the sense-making conjunction of sources in the intentionality of the final form could be an offence against the literal sense said to be respected by historical enquiry of a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 30) </b>certain sort. Here again, we simply run up against the complexity of what it means to speak of a literal sense and mean by that both historicality and also a proper appreciation of the subject matter under discussion in the light of the canonical witness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How, then, can the historicality of the witness be retained (as much for theological as for purportedly historical reasons) but the subject matter under discussion not artificially limited to a single authorial intention as we can reconstruct that with critical tools (itself a sort of science of conjecture)? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">‘The Trinity</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">and</b></i> <b class="calibre3">the Old Testament’</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rephrasing the title helps illustrate the character of the challenge for thinking about Trinitarian language in respect of the scriptures of Israel. It could be argued that the descriptions of God's identity and work testified to in His life with Israel, and how these diverge from alternative presentations in the surrounding culture, are what actually fund a Trinitarian conceptuality. That is, it is the unique theological depiction of the Holy One of Israel that forces one to reflect dynamically and dogmatically on the triune life of God as true to that life in an ontological sense. This is quite a different undertaking than hunting for threesomes hidden away inside the activity of God in the Old Covenant. The pressure toward accounting for the eternal life of God as ‘Trinitarian’ emerges because of the character of claims made about God in the scriptures of Israel, to which one frequently assigns the term ‘monotheistic’. The problem here is that the term ‘monotheism’, when used in reference to the Old Testament, is nothing but a placeholder serving to rule out some obvious alternatives (Israel did not worship multiple gods in a pantheon) but in itself it is imprecise. At issue is the  <i class="calibre4">kind</i> of monotheism said to mark the life of God with his people Israel. The very fact that this life belongs to the Holy One of Israel, and not several discrete deities, means that the ways in which this One God is personally related to his people must refract through a single lens but in such a way that God is truly present and truly alive in relationship and truly in communication. The terms the OT uses to express this Living character are manifold but not limitless. God creates through wisdom. God speaks through his word. God enlivens through the spirit. God is present in holiness and yet remains transcendent. God relates to an elect people and to creation as a whole but Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">has also a beloved son (Psalm 2). Humanity is said to be made in the image of God. There is a beginning ( <i class="calibre4">bereshith</i>) in relationship to God which can be seen as a begotten agency, through whom the heavens and earth are made (Genesis 1 and Proverbs 8; more below). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, God has a name, Yhwh, the name above all names, but by which he can be called upon by those to whom he has made himself known. The offices governing Israel's life—prophet, priest, sage, king, promised ancestor, hymn writer—respond to and speak forth the various ways that God acts dynamically in relationship to the world and to his chosen people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stated negatively, the fact that Israel ‘shall have no other gods before me’ (Deut. 5:7) does not result in a limitation of communication or a restriction of relationship, based <b class="calibre3">(p. 31) </b>upon simple arithmetic. Rather, this core conviction creates the conditions for the most personal kind of relationship because it is focused on a single divine referent, whose character is known through covenantal persistence in relationship—in judgement and in mercy—through time. Theologically, it is the peculiar eccentricity of this Holy One of Israel—the LORD, the LORD, compassionate and merciful—that calls forth a description of the divine character as inherently dynamic and personal, offering the potential for further clarification, such as Trinitarian claims will wish to make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For later Christian theological reflection, it is the very existence of the scriptures of Israel and their commitment to a peculiar kind of monotheism that gives rise to Trinitarian convictions about the character of God, such that, lacking these scriptures and their specific literal-sense declarations, we would simply have no Trinitarian talk at all, but rather something like the divinization of Jesus (with the help of borrowed titles having not much to do with him in reality). The precondition of Trinitarian reflection, in other words, is precisely the Old Testament of early Christian reception and interpretation. Had there been no reception of these writings as the sole authoritative witness to the work and identity of God, during which period the New Testament writings were coming to form, the conditions would not have been in place for the kind of Trinitarian theological thinking that emerged. This thinking is witnessed to in nascent form in the writings that would come to form a second canonical record, the New Testament, in early Christian hymns and in specific exegetical handling of the OT in the NT. But the pressure for this nascent witness, as it comes to expression in the second testament, came from the literal sense of the Old Testament and what it said of God (Rowe 2002; Childs 1993; Bauckham 1999). </p>
<p class="calibre1">To say that ‘Jesus Christ is Lord’ is not then to answer a concern for awarding him a status above angels or other intermediaries and thus to legitimate Christian worship of Christ and insist that such worship is not blasphemy. Nor is it, in the first instance, to ward off efforts to divinize Jesus that would separate his deity so stated from what could be said of the God of Israel, the God of ‘Jewish Scriptures’. These challenges will take form very quickly from different quarters and they are hovering around early New Testament descriptions, but they do not form the primary background or logic for why the Trinitarian talk that does emerge in nascent form emerges in the first instance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason for this is that it is everywhere assumed that the scriptures of Israel describe God as God is, and that no other means of speaking of God, or of understanding who God is, are available in the most basic sense. The fact that the scriptures of Israel, moreover, do not exist in the form of tidy theological propositions, but rather describe the lived life of God with a people, in ‘many and various ways’ present and communicating within a single literal sense witness (Hebrews 1), does not lessen this restriction just stated but enriches it. Early Christian argument about the character of Jesus Christ and his identity, therefore, cannot be anything more or less than  <i class="calibre4">accordance with the scriptures</i> (Seitz 1998: 51–60). Jesus Christ is who he is  <i class="calibre4">in accordance with</i> a witness stating the nature of God, alongside of which there is simply no rival. Earliest Christian belief is predicated on being able to distinguish between ‘it is written’ and what that entails, as against the general religious milieu of Judaism (itself variegated), on the one hand; and  <b class="calibre3">(p. 32) </b>full acknowledgement with the Judaisms of the period that ‘the oracles of God entrusted to the Jews’ (Romans 3) come from within a privileged witness and cannot be accessed otherwise, but only correlated in crude ways (Paul's efforts with the very religious at Athens, for example). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordance can of course take the form of economic accounts, as in the speeches of Acts from Stephen, Peter, and Paul, where who Jesus is belongs within a sacred history, selective accounts of which serve to locate God's actions in time in respect of the earthly Jesus, ‘who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, died and was buried’—much as the narrative creeds and early baptismal interrogatories will state this. These selective accounts may choose to focus on creation, ancestors, judges, David, prophets, psalms, depending on the occasion and context, but they all assume that this selection, however wide or limited, is the only true description within which the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, his ascension and coming again, make sense, gain their theological truthfulness and their capacity to convict and persuade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The authority of the received scriptures, their irreducible accounts of the One God, and the kind of accounts these are, given the monotheism being testified to, are what create the conditions for the other kind of accordance we see in the NT, for which shorthand we label ‘ontological accordance’. At issue here is describing Jesus Christ not as he can be located on a temporal grid, enclosing that which is set forth in the scriptures of Israel and then using that same time-line as well to speak of the place of the Church and Israel before his Coming Again. That is, allowing the first economic time-line to expand such as we see it in Romans 9–11, for example, and in this way deferring to its authoritative character (‘the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable’) whilst also seeing in it a ‘mystery’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">only now fully grasped, in respect of the Church as comprised of circumcised and uncircumcised ‘fellow heirs’ both (Romans, Colossians, Ephesians). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This other kind of accordance is a reaction of theological and exegetical reflection occasioned by the pressure of the literal sense of the scriptures of Israel. It understands within the literal sense descriptions of God's eternal life with Israel there to be a surplus, planted in the original inspired testimony and so ingredient in the witness and so also in God's act of self revelation. It is not a sense  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>. Moreover, if it were a dogmatic  <i class="calibre4">ad</i> Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">extra</i>, or if it was the creation of an imaginative exegesis capable of correlation with Second Temple methods historically made more precise (as useful as this is in its own way), and  <i class="calibre4">understandable chiefly on those grounds</i>, it would not be the kind of Trinitarian claim that Christians could say was true to who Jesus Christ genuinely is, such that he is to be worshipped and called Lord. What Christians (comprised in the first instance of the one people of God) claimed to be true of Jesus they grounded as truthfully alive in the one literal sense witness of the only scriptures, and their only true account of who God was and is and is to be, Yhwh, the Maker of Heaven and Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus far we have been speaking about nascent Trinitarian reflection because, strictly speaking, we are speaking of the identity of Jesus Christ as enclosed within the literal sense reference of statements the scriptures of Israel—the sole scriptures of the early Christian movement—make about the One God. As such, they are strictly speaking ‘binitarian’, so long as we keep in view that the term is a weak one, meaning only that the character of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 33) </b>the Holy Spirit as a Person of the Trinity requires extrapolation from within the same conceptual framework which, in the first instance, declares that the earthly Jesus is the Christ through whom all things were made, the eternal Son of God, the one to whom has been given the name above every name (Yhwh), at the right hand of the Father, and so forth. The difficulty attending to the Holy Spirit's co-ordination with the Father and Son is well known and cannot be the subject of a detailed treatment here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is mentioned only to acknowledge that the challenge exists (and we will examine one creative account of it below), but this need not hinder the retrieval of the conditions under which the first Christians claimed that Jesus Christ was eternally within the identity of the One God of Israel, Yhwh, the Maker of Heaven and Earth. We return to the Person of the Holy Spirit at the close. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Literal Sense as the Spiritual Sense</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In his exegesis of Psalm 22 (LXX 21), Thomas Aquinas refers to the condemnation of Theodore of Mopsuestia, in the light of his interpretation of this and other psalms (translation made available online by DeSales University as part of their Aquinas Translation Project: 〈http://www4.desales.edu/~philtheo/loughlin/ATP/Psalm_21.html〉; the issue is a much wider one, of course; Theodore held that only three psalms referred to Christ via prophesy). Aquinas speaks of the historical reading of Psalm 22, whereby the human author is held to intend a single referent only (David) and declares it an attenuated sense—</p>
<p class="calibre1">such was the reading of Theodore in his view and in the view of Church councils (we speak here only of the record and not to rise in its defence). Aquinas is well aware of the problems attending prodigal sense-making and his own appeal to the literal sense of this and other psalms is remarkably constrained. He is fully aware that the author of the psalm refers both to realities in the days of Israel and especially to matters that relate more naturally at one level to the David of history (the reference to sins in verse 1 (LXX v. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2), as brokered by the translation process into Greek and Latin from the Hebrew's more neutral ‘groans’). Along with the tradition, he nevertheless sees Christ as the referent of the psalm and says that ‘sins’ refers to that which Christ bears for the Church. The sub</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ject matter of the psalm has to do with David and Christ both. The author is inspired to see something which in God's providence has a dual reference. This is the literal sense, and for Aquinas the alternative to a literal sense is not a higher, spiritual sense but the restricted historical sense-making undertaken in the interpretation of Theodore. No, the literal sense  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the spiritual sense, he states, as if self-evident. By this he means that the human author, as inspired by God, spoke of things of such lofty significance that the final intentionality might well not have been clearly seen, and indeed probably was only seen for what it was at a later time. Yet, that single author's literal sense-making contained the reality in earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We see here an example of flexibility in thinking about authorial intention and sense reference that guards the historicality of the witness, but refuses to say that intentionality <b class="calibre3">(p. 34) </b>is governed or restricted by what we can say about the historical context of the inspired agent's literal sense. Subsequent use of the Psalm—as in the NT's recording of the crucifixion, with its various psalmic resonances—is allowed room to be included in what one can say about the author's intention and in that allowance Thomas and others believed they were comprehending the divine intention (the literal spiritual sense) which first warranted the speaking as such, within the historicality of Israel's life with God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While this particular example functions against the backdrop of two testaments, we can also see it at work in the early interpretation of Christ's identity with God, within the context of a single authoritative witness (the Old Testament). How was this so? First, it was recognized (often in line with the instincts of someone like Philo, who was concerned with the dynamics of divine action and identity and was seeking to understand that in the context of kindred concerns of his day to speak of the divine logos, for example, apart from the scriptural witness which oriented his own enquiry) that to speak of the One God in relationship to the world and to an elect people was already to ask about the internal logic of scripture's literal sense. What was needed was a way to make the proper correlations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Prov. 8:22 spoke of God creating a ‘beginning’ of ways, what might this have to do with the ‘beginning’ of Genesis 1? Or from within a very different set of constraints, if God spoke of a beloved son who would rule the nations, what did it mean that David did this only provisionally if at all, if the literal sense was to mean anything other than rhetorical excess? Psalm 89 described this same son as firstborn, a status God had to make for him (Ps. 89:27). What was one to make of what we might call the composite intentionality of these various different passages? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For our purposes, given the scope of this entry, we will focus on one prominent example: the way in which ‘beginning’ was seen to point to a divine agency generated from God's own self. The key texts are Genesis 1 and Proverbs 8—the latter of which would prove to be the major testing ground for Christian efforts to speak of Christ's relationship to God, in the generations leading up to and then culminating in Athanasius’  <i class="calibre4">Contra Arianos</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving the particularities of that long trail aside, it must be stressed that the debate was a thoroughgoing interpretative and exegetical one. At every point along the way, at issue is the strict letter, its appearance in a variety of textual traditions (Hebrew; the competing Greek versions; Jerome's own translations), word studies (what does the Hebrew verb Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">qnh</i> mean and what do the various Greek renderings clarify or obscure), and above all, associations across the Old Testament and within the flow of Prov. 8:22–31 itself (do the verbs relate to the same action of generation; various aspects of that; or of generation and incarnation, etc.). That is, the mature Trinitarian discussions, as these pertain to the relationship of Christ to God, are textual and exegetical ones, and they have to do with the way the Old Testament delivers its sense. It is for this reason that, while the discussion ranges over several centuries, after the existence of a two testament Christian Bible (in various forms), it is important all the same for our purposes, because it believes that the Trinitarian convictions of the Christian faith are grounded in the one scripture given by God to Israel and received through Christ by the Church. It is concerned with the sense-making of the Old Testament for the language about God, which will become Trinitarian in various ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 35) </b>Colossians offers a good example of the way in which the literal sense of the Old Testament was seen as delivering up an account of Christ as eternally at work with God, an account which tracks well into subsequent Christian interpretation and argumentation. Christ is image (1:15), and from the various indications of Colossians’ speaking of a New Creation, we can conclude that Christ is seen to be the image of Genesis 1, now restored and living the risen life into which the Church has been transported (Col. 3:10: ‘being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator’). But most importantly Christ is firstborn (Col. 1:15) and—taking the cue from the language of ‘before’ that follows and the notion of creation through Christ (Col. 1:16–20)—it is clarified that this ‘first-bornness’ is  <i class="calibre4">before</i> creation. The imagery being used and the terms being deployed come from the way in which the Old Testament is said to be delivering its literal sense, once one grasps the composite intention of Proverbs 8 and Genesis 1 (Burney 1926; Beetham 2008). The ‘in beginning’ of Genesis 1 is heard alongside Prov. 8:22, ‘he acquired/begat me the beginning of his ways’ (the proper translation of which comes by grasping the implications of the verb  <i class="calibre4">qnh</i> as shown elsewhere in the OT; and in relationship with the verb </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘bring forth’ which follows in vv. 24–5; and in the light of the companionship clearly stated in verse 27), with the result that one speaks of Christ as ‘begotten before’ or  <i class="calibre4">proto</i> + </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">tokos</i>. The Old Testament's literal sense, when heard in its composite intentionality, declares the reality of an agency with God before creation, not independently acquired or made (as a dominant later Greek translation would intimate, through the verb  <i class="calibre4">ektisen</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">compare  <i class="calibre4">ektesato</i> of Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus or  <i class="calibre4">bara’</i> of the Targum—creating debates within Christian circles, especially in the exegesis of Arius). Now Genesis 1 can be heard as saying: ‘in  <i class="calibre4">arche</i>—in beginning—in firstborn’ God created the heavens and the earth. The rabbinic idea of ‘in beginning’ as referring to torah, as ‘in Torah God created the heavens and the earth’, tracks closely alongside this, and it is likewise derived from the way in which Proverbs 8 was thought to be speaking of ‘eternal generation’ and ‘creation through’, in this case, by/of Torah (‘Now the Law says, “By  <i class="calibre4">reshith</i> God created”; and there is no  <i class="calibre4">reshith</i> except the Law; compare the passage, “The Lord gat me as the <i class="calibre4">reshith</i> of His way” ’ ( <i class="calibre4">Bereshith Rabba</i>)). When then John speaks of ‘in beginning ( <i class="calibre4">reshith</i>; <i class="calibre4">arche</i>) was the word, and the word with God’ he also is tracking very closely the exegetical penetration of the literal sense of Genesis and Proverbs, consistent with the logic of Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Col. 1:15–20. Note carefully that this is at some remove from what one might call ‘allegorical’ interpretation, and it is equally distant from finding threesomes in obscure episodes of God's dealing with Israel. Rather, the earliest (incipient) ‘Trinity in the Old Testament’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">is a conviction that the One God of Israel acts through the agency of his eternal companion to bring creation into being and order. In so doing, ruled out is tritheism or bitheism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And also to be denounced is any sense that the monotheism of the sole scriptural witness, so carefully guarded, because so true to God's character as the Holy One of Israel, has been voided or replaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Others have shown how the mature declaration of Christ as ‘of one substance’ with the Father—the Greek term never appearing in Christian scripture—is precisely the judgement rendered by the texts of scripture when one hears Phil. 2:5–11 properly, in the light of Isa. 45:20–5 (Bauckham 1999; Seitz 1998, 2001; Yeago 1994). The latter insists—in <b class="calibre3">(p. 36) </b>the strongest language the OT provides—that Yhwh is God alone, ‘there is none beside me’. This declaration is stronger, one might conclude, than henotheism (‘you shall have no other gods’) or Ezekiel's ironic intimations that if ‘gods’ ( <i class="calibre4">’elohim</i>) exist, they are </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘dung balls’ ( <i class="calibre4">g’llulim</i>). God is alone, there is no other, and he can swear only by himself, and so only by his own name, declaring that every knee will confess his Lordship and in so doing be saved (Isa. 45:22–5). When Philippians, then, speaks of receiving the name above every name, it is declaring that Christ has the authority of The Name, Yhwh, and exists within that selfsame identity. This happens in such a way that the Father is glorified, in accordance with Isaiah, but now stated in incipiently Trinitarian terms: ‘Therefore God has highly exalted him and given him the name that is above every name (God's own majestic name Yhwh), that (now) at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow (so the solemn oath of Isa. 45:23), to the glory of God the Father’ (Phil. 2:11). Not far away are the Johannine ‘I am’ statements, and the declarations that Christ has declared the name (17:26) and kept his disciples in the name (17:11–12). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Holy Spirit of the Trinity and the Old Testament</b> The conviction that God in creation acts through the agency of his word or wisdom finds its way into Hellenistic Judaism and early Christian writers like Theophilus of Antioch and Athenagoras. The former can speak of wisdom and word as hands of God (the means by which the ‘let us’ of God, Wisdom, and Word created humankind, as against creation by the word alone, 2.18). Less clear however is the relationship between Wisdom and Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ps. 33:6 (LXX 32:6) can be cited in such a way that its word and spirit refer to word and wisdom, but at other places this is left unstated.  <i class="calibre4">Targum Neofiti</i> (difficult to date specifically) also provides Gen. 1:1–2 with a creation through wisdom and word. The fact that spirit is mentioned in verse 2 is not specifically correlated with this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In these cases the confusion exists because of the way in which the various texts (Proverbs 8, Genesis 1, Psalms) when combined do not create a single or overly uniform account. So we can find Theophilus simply providing a kind of catalogue of titles which Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">sum up the pre-existent agencies who operate with God, bringing about creation of the world and in time inspiring the prophets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore God, having his own Logos innate in his own bowels ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Ps. 109:3), generated him together with his own Sophia, vomiting him forth (Ps. 44:2) before everything else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He used this Logos as his servant in the things created by him, and through him he made all things ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 1:3). He is called beginning because he leads and dominates everything fashioned through him. It was he,  <i class="calibre4">Spirit of God</i> (Gen. 1:2) and  <i class="calibre4">Beginning</i> (Gen 1:1) and <i class="calibre4">Sophia</i> (Prov. 8:22) and  <i class="calibre4">Power of the Most High</i> (Lk. 1:35), who came down into all the prophets and spoke through them about the creation of the world and all the rest ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Ad</i> <i class="calibre4">Autolycum</i> 2,9). For the prophets did not exist when the world came into existence; <b class="calibre3">(p. 37) </b>there were the Sophia of God which is in him and his holy Logos who is always present with him. For this reason he speaks thus through Solomon the prophet (citing Proverbs 8). And Moses, who lived many years before Solomon—or rather, the Logos of God speaking through him as an instrument—says, ‘In the Beginning God created the heaven and earth’ ( <i class="calibre4">Ad Autolycum</i> 2,10 (Grant 1970)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Proverbs 8 can refer to either Word or Wisdom/Spirit in some of the earliest Christian accounts, including Irenaeus as well. In  <i class="calibre4">Adversus Haereses</i> IV,20,3 the Word was always with the Father as well as the Spirit, in this instance declaring that the wisdom referred to in Proverbs 8 is the Spirit, not the Logos. In Athenagoras ( <i class="calibre4">Legatio</i> 10.4) it appears that the reference to the Spirit in connection with Proverbs 8 means that agent of inspiration who clarifies that the referent of 8:22 is the Word (Schoedel 1972). Only with Clement and Origen do we begin getting a consistent referent for Prov. 8:22 as the Word, where </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Beginning’ is a virtual title for Christ (Young 2003: 105). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course we are on very different ground when it comes to the Holy Spirit than we are with the question of Jesus Christ and the Holy One of Israel within a Trinity in the Old Testament. This is because the Holy Spirit is an agent in his own right in the Old Testament, even with allowance for the distinction between spirit/wind and the more specific third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is active in both testaments, inspiring Israel, as with David's psalmic compositions (‘the Spirit of the Lord speaks by me’, 2 Sam. 23:2) or Zechariah's thanksgiving or Elizabeth's confession (‘his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit’ or ‘Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit’, Lk. 1:41, 67). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea of the Spirit of God inspiring prophets, priests, sages, judges, hymn-writers, and singers is ingredient in how divine action is understood. What takes time is understanding the Spirit of the Lord as his own person, and as we have seen, this happens in conjunction with the way in which God's activity in creation is comprehended in respect of the Word of God, in Jewish and Christian circles. The specifically Christian challenge is one of relating this Logos of God with God and the Holy Spirit both. Only in time will the language of generation and procession emerge, and the technical discussion will not govern and control all Christian talk at this point, just as matters of the Holy Spirit's procession will divide the East and the West. Some of the challenge, as relevant for our purpose, comes from handling the letter of two testaments carefully and knowing exactly how to relate the work of the Spirit (‘who spake by the prophets’) with the Pentecostal gifting it</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">self. Luther fought on two fronts at this point, challenging an account of the Spirit which located his work in the councils of the Church, on the one hand; and the other which saw the Spirit as a special gift only available this side of Pentecost and independent of an account of the Church or Israel at all. The independence of the Holy Spirit at work in the Old Covenant assured his integrity as a Person of the Trinity. David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, was gifted to see the inner Trinitarian life, as the Holy Spirit showed him the Father and the Son in beloved dialogue before the day of Pentecost or the councils of the Church (Helmer 2002). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Old Testament shows the Holy Spirit to be that Person of the Trinity whose sole agency is to point away from himself and to the God who is the source of creation and inspiration. He is the person whose activity is deferential. He is that ‘hand of God’ from <b class="calibre3">(p. 38) </b>the ‘let us’ of Gen. 1:26 whose sole divine vocation is to place Israel's and the Church's hand in the hand of their Lord. When in Psalm 2 or Psalm 110 we get direct speech from God to David; or when in Proverbs 8 we hear of God's ‘Beginning of ways’; in all cases it is the Spirit with the divine warrant to reveal the inner life of God's own self, who says to His beloved Son ‘today I have begotten you’; or ‘sit at my right hand’; or ‘the LORD made me Beginning of his ways’. This spirit who spake by the prophets is the Holy Spirit of Christian Trinitarian conviction, proceeding from God, alongside the Word, ‘who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several key NT passages also indicate that the Spirit of Israel's Lord is now in identification with Jesus Christ. In 2 Cor. 3:16 the unveiled turning to the Lord bespeaks Moses’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">unveiled beholding of God's glory in the Old Covenant (Exodus 34:34), and Paul calls this beholding an acknowledgement of the Spirit: the Lord is the Spirit. Turning to Yhwh is a turning to the Spirit of the Father (to use the language of Trinitarian differentiation). This beholding in the New Covenant is a beholding enabled by Christ, and of Christ, also ‘the Lord’. Paul uses  <i class="calibre4">kyrios</i> to identify the Spirit Lordship of the Father and the Son. ‘Read canonically, then, the full unity of God as expressed through his name  <i class="calibre4">kyrios</i> is that of the Father, Son, and Spirit: the  <i class="calibre4">kyrios heis</i> (one Lord) of Deut. 6:4 is in the New Testament differentiated into  <i class="calibre4">kyrios pater</i> (Father),  <i class="calibre4">kyrios iesous</i> (Son), and  <i class="calibre4">kyrios pneuma</i> (Spirit). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus the oneness and unity of God is not impaired but dynamically upheld through the use of his name  <i class="calibre4">kyrios</i> for the Father, Son and Spirit, the One Lord God’ (Rowe 2002: 304). A similar move is at work in Gal. 4:4–6, where God's sending forth of his Son is paired with the sending forth the Spirit of the Son, a sending forth which enables us to cry out ‘Father’. And in Rom. 8:9–11 the explicit movement back and forth of referents to the Spirit (‘The Spirit’ in 8:9a; ‘Spirit of God the Father’ in 8:9b, ‘Spirit of Christ’ (8:9c and 10), and ‘Spirit of God the Father’ in 8:11) means that the Spirit of the God of Israel now differentiates in One Lord, in three persons (see also Rowe 2002, and compare Soulen 1999). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusions</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinity in the Old Testament is not an invitation to search for threesomes in the scriptures of Israel, but instead is tied up with a proper understanding and confession about how the literal sense speaks of its divine referent. It is important to observe how the discussions of the Trinity in the Early Church are relentlessly exegetical in nature, and indeed must be: Yhwh, the Holy One of Israel, is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit not because such was required for a proper estimate of Jesus Christ as God or the Spirit as God, but because this was held to be what the literal sense of the Old Testament required when its deliverances were properly grasped, in the light of Christ, as conveyed by the Holy Spirit. Later creedal formulations are the scriptures of Israel and the New Testament accordances ‘coming to boil’. Luther was right to argue that  <b class="calibre3">(p. 39) </b>any account of the Trinity must be based on a proper understanding of the semantics of Old Testament sense-making, and not be conceived either as later historical developments or located in the Church's authority to see something, and so warranting the Trinitarian talk from within its own sense-making. The Holy Spirit ‘spake by the prophets’ and so revealed from the Old Testament the majesty of Yhwh, the Lord, upholding this majesty and showing it to be properly understood as a Trinity of Persons in One God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines the concept of Trinity in the Book of Hebrews and Pauline epistles in the New Testament. Rather than seeking “proof-texts” or studying the implications of particular words as applied to Jesus, this article suggests that the narrative fabric of the books sets forth an idiom, a grammar, or logic, that can only be rightly interpreted through Trinitarian conceptions. It suggests that attending carefully to the linguistic pattern of the texts' speech about God requires us to look behind the actual arguments of the texts to the theological judgements that make such language possible and that the sense that the New Testament language makes depends upon a larger pattern of theological judgements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, Book of Hebrews, Pauline epistles, New Testament, Jesus, narrative fabric, linguistic pattern, God, theological judgements</p>
<p class="calibre1">About this we have much to say that is hard to explain (Heb. 5:11)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Prolegomena</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">AS we know from ancient biblical manuscript evidence, Hebrews frequently circulated with the rest of the  <i class="calibre4">corpus Paulinum</i> and was considered the fourteenth of Paul's letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, even our earliest attested form of the Pauline letters includes Hebrews (P46). This did not, however, prevent ancient scholars from expressing serious reservations or outright doubts about the Pauline authorship of Hebrews. Tertullian, to mention a prominent example, believed the author was Barnabas. Origen was less sanguine: about the author of Hebrews, he said, ‘only God knows’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> Today it is safe to say that most scholars would agree with the ancient sceptics against the view of authorship implied by the manuscript tradition and accepted by Jerome and Augustine (among many others). Though there is hardly a consensus about the identity of Hebrews’ author—the suggestions are many and varied (Barnabas, Apollos, Silas, Priscilla, etc.)—it would be exceedingly difficult to find a modern New Testament scholar who would argue for the Pauline authorship of Hebrews. Indeed, it would be only slightly less difficult to find academics in the mainstream of New Testament scholarship who would argue for the Pauline authorship of all thirteen of the Pauline epistles. From a typical New Testament scholar's perspective, therefore, grouping these fourteen texts together is likely to seem artificial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermeneutically considered, however, a modern judgement of this kind is in fact no more than the concrete evidence of privileging a certain kind of interpretive commitment over others, the kind that believes that the New Testament texts should be arranged  <b class="calibre3">(p. 42) </b>according to authorship (as it is critically reconstructed). But, as everyone knows, plenteous other schemata are on offer. We could, for example, organize the texts according to the drift of their reception history, their canonical order, their genre, their similarity in patterns of thought, and so on. In each case, the ordering of the texts would result from a particular hermeneutical posture vis-à-vis the canonical witness and would require—no less than presuppose—theological justification for its adoption. In the case of this article, the justification is rather simple: grouping Hebrews together with Paul allows us to inhabit a particular stream of Christian reflection on the biblical texts as a way to direct our attention to certain theologically productive modes of reading that have by and large been forgotten in the modern period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet we would be mistaken were we to think that a Pauline/Hebrews organization in particular would facilitate a more Trinitarian reading than any other, or help us to draw more clearly the lines between Scripture and its dogmatic explication. The reason, of course, is that the doctrine of the Trinity is not based upon a particular ordering of only a few biblical texts. It is instead the antecedent theological logic of the Christian canon as a whole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offering an ultimate justification for grouping all the letters attributed to Paul together with Hebrews is therefore not only unnecessary but, strictly speaking, impossible in an article focused on the connection between these texts and the doctrine of the Trinity. The working procedure herein is instead no more complicated than seeing how the Trinitarian framework helps us to read well the language about God in these texts. Methodologically considered, however, such a statement could point in any number of different directions, and we must therefore elucidate its intent for this particular article. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> <b class="calibre3">Approach</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking Trinitarian doctrine as the hermeneutical lens through which we consider Paul's letters and Hebrews entails the following points as basic corollaries to the more fundamental shape of the enquiry: <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> The texts considered below are not to be read as evidence of ‘proof-texting’ in the manner of the old  <i class="calibre4">dicta probantia</i>/ <i class="calibre4">classica</i>. Despite the disdain of modern critics, it is true that we can still learn much from this older way of reading Scripture. For example, we always have particular schemata that help to structure our reading of Scripture; we cannot think, that is, without ordering thought. The schemata of the  <i class="calibre4">dicta</i> <i class="calibre4">classica</i> are clear—above board, so to speak—whereas those of contemporary New Testament scholars are frequently hidden behind false and illusory notions of an exegesis that prescinds from larger doctrinal commitments. Paying attention to an overt schema should help us to become more aware of the way in which the order of our thought already directs our exegetical attention in certain ways rather than others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 43) </b>Still, it is hard to deny that the manner by which these compendia remove particular words or phrases from their more immediate scriptural contexts ignores hermeneutically what is prima facie one of the most striking aspects of holy Scripture itself, namely, that it is has discrete literary units (‘books’). Put more directly: the methodological moves of the older proof-texting approach occlude the theological significance of the surface shape of Scripture. If modern biblical studies has anything crucial to teach us in this respect, it is that engagement with the literary texture of Scripture's surface forms a critical part of fruitful interpretation in our own time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> The texts considered below are also not focused interpretively by ‘predication’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To put it bluntly, for many interpreters of Scripture, modern biblical criticism destroyed the possibility of taking the  <i class="calibre4">dicta probantia</i> seriously as a way to conceive constructively the relation between Scripture and the Church's doctrinal teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They therefore sought other methods by which to connect the Bible with doctrinal explication. Prominent among these was a mode of reading whereby the New Testament was explored for passages in which, for example, the word  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> (God) was predicated of Jesus (e.g. Jn 1:1, 18, Rom. 9:5, etc.). Because of their immediate relevance to what it would mean to think of Jesus as divine, these texts were thought to help fund materially the doctrine of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is doubtless much to learn from the collection of such passages, but the problem remains that the exegetical procedure is still vulnerable to the critique of more sceptical scholars who see this approach as the residue of an older method of reading Scripture that extracted small amounts of texts for a predetermined outcome. Attending more carefully to the immediate context of these statements, so it was argued, disclosed not so much the prefiguration of later doctrinal truths as it did a complex set of exegetical ambiguities (e.g. the significance of the anarthrous use of  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> in Jn 1:1 for the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>). In short, though the predication approach helped to direct our attention to striking features Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> of the scriptural texts, it remained within the ambit of a kind of exegesis that was unable to deal with the vast amounts of biblical material that would obviously not fit inside the range of texts generated by the methodology. It therefore furthered rather than countered the impression created by the older proof-texting model of reading, namely, that the Bible and Christian doctrine could only be related artificially through some version of an externally imposed schema. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> The texts considered below are not examined through a lens ground by a (re)construction of a particular historical trajectory: a kind of reading structured by the question of ‘how we got here from there’, or focused on the way in which Scripture raised theological issues that could only be settled after decades of rigorous doctrinal reflection. In more recent history—after the rise of the so-called ‘historical consciousness’—this approach has been rather common. All treatments of the development of doctrine, whether of a more liberal (e.g. Adolf Harnack) or more traditional (e.g. Alister McGrath) leaning, presuppose the theological importance of attending to the linear dimension of history and move from the biblical texts to the later creedal formulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 44) </b>Accounts of the relation between Scripture and the dogmatic tradition that are shaped by a conception of a historical trajectory that begins in Scripture and moves toward the creeds are particularly important. This importance is tied not only to the fact that such accounts take seriously the historical shape of our noetic boundaries but also because they can be read—whether their author intends it or not—as attempts to foreground the economy of God's self-revelation. By attending carefully to the linear dimension of doctrine, studies premised on the significance of historical trajectory correspond to the epistemic priority of the economic Trinity and help us to (re)trace the path of theological knowledge from the economic to the immanent reality of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> Instead of the three reading strategies just described, the approach in this article takes shape from the three primary considerations:</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the theological grammar in the New Testament presupposes certain basic judgements about the identity of God. The particular grammatical moves of the texts could not be made, that is, unless larger theological judgements have been made that allow these linguistic possibilities. Put thetically: the New Testament speech could not have taken shape in precisely this way unless X or Y is true about God. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘unless’ then requires explication in a theological idiom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, the development of the doctrine of the Trinity was the explication of this ‘unless’, the unpacking of the internal theological logic behind the particular form of Scripture's grammar. In part, of course, this is what it means to say that the immanent Trinity is ontologically prior to the economic (whereas the economic is epistemically prior to the immanent). But it is also what it means to say that Trinitarian doctrine is the lens through which we can rightly perceive the particular form of Scripture's speaking about the identity of the God who has revealed himself there. To employ a Trinitarian framework to read Scripture, therefore, is hardly to impose an artificial schema upon the New Testament. It is instead to reason inside the theologi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> cal patterns required to understand the language used to speak about God in the texts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third, precisely because the doctrine of the Trinity is the true reception of Scripture's particular way of speaking about the identity of the Christian God, it also constitutes an otherwise unavailable form of exegetical perception. Thinking in Trinitarian patterns does not obfuscate the specificity of argument in, for example, Romans or 1 Corinthians—turning it into, say, an actual argument about the Trinity—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but rather interprets the particular language about God within the horizon of that language's subject matter ( <i class="calibre4">res</i>). In this way, Trinitarian reasoning enables us better to understand the deep and theologically essential connection between the specific language of Scripture and the God who—always and antecedently—speaks it forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 45) Hebrews and the Pauline Letters</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the amount of material involved in treating Hebrews and Paul, we obviously cannot aspire to comprehensiveness. What we can do, however, is to select strategically important passages that have substantial bearing not only on our reading of the larger text under discussion (e.g. Hebrews 1 is important rhetorically for the whole of the letter) but also on our more central question. In so doing, we shall by and large omit discussion of the protracted exegetical debates that surround virtually every verse of these texts and shall instead simply display our readings of the selected passages on the way to a more synthetic judgement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hebrews</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hebrews is a complex text whose basic theological grammar exhibits many and various substantive connections to the doctrine of the Trinity. Because it would be impossible to canvas the entire letter, we must restrict our enquiry to particularly striking features of these connections. The opening two chapters of the letter relate directly to our central concern, and we shall therefore focus our attention there (though let it be noted that what can be said here about Hebrews applies elsewhere in the letter). </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Hebrews’ theology has been thought to be ‘supersessionist’—a judgement that is in need of serious rethinking—it cannot be on account of its doctrine of God. Indeed, the first verse of chapter 1 immediately and clearly identifies the God about whom Hebrews speaks as the God of Israel, the one who ‘spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets’ (Heb. 1:1). This is not a new God, a divine figure other than the Jewish God, the one who brooks no rivals, whose identity is bound together with his uniqueness, and whose demand for worship is therefore total and exclusive. Indeed, the opening of the letter both states and assumes that the  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> of Hebrews is in no way anything other than the Old Testament God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> This point is important to grasp clearly because immediately the letter begins to render more complex the identity of just that God by extending the range of language by which we could rightly speak of him: ‘But in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed as the heir of all things, and through whom he also made the ages’ (Heb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1:2). Over against the notion that the Son is a divine figure to be contrasted with God, Hebrews immediately speaks of their interrelation. The Son is the ‘radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature’ (Heb. 1:3). To put it in contemporary language, the Son is not other than God but is in fact God expressed or externalized—embodied, as we will shortly see—in relation to the world. That the Son is not fundamentally other than God is immediately made explicit by the citation of Psalm 44 in which the address to God ( <i class="calibre4">ho theos</i>) is extended to include the Son: ‘But of the Son he (God) says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever” ’ (Ps. 44:7, LXX). The  <b class="calibre3">(p. 46) </b>theological judgement underlying this hermeneutical move is rather clear: the Son is none other than the God of whom the Psalm speaks. </p>
