<p class="calibre1">The Eucharistic experience of divine–human communion in Christ constitutes the basis for what Zizioulas labels as the two ‘leavenings’ of Greek ontology by Christian theology (Zizioulas 1985: 39). The first is the affirmation of creation  <i class="calibre4">ex nihilo</i>, which grounds the uncreated and created distinction, and which is demanded if the communion between the two is to be one of freedom and love, and not of necessity. This creation out of nothing indicates positively that creation's only hope for existence is a free and loving communion with the uncreated; negatively, it indicates that creation itself is inherently finite and, by itself, tends toward its own annihilation. Creation itself exhibits a longing to be free from the necessity of finitude inherent in its own nature. This longing is especially evident in the human creation of art (Zizioulas 2006: 206–49), in erotic relations (Zizioulas 1985: 49–53), and in the phenomenological analysis of the question, ‘Who am I?’ (Zizioulas 2006: 99–112), all of which indicate a human drive for particularity and otherness that is ultimately thwarted by finitude and death. This thwarted longing renders human existence ultimately tragic, since the conditions for its fulfilment do not exist within created nature, but only in communion with the uncreated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The experience of communion in the Eucharist, and thus, of particularity and otherness, reveals that the being of God exists such as to be free to commune with what is not-God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that this communion is realized in Christ by the Holy Spirit reveals that God's being is itself a communion between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is important, however, for Zizioulas that theology not conceptualize this communion in the being of God in terms of necessity. His logic is as follows: since creation itself longs for a free</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> dom from the annihilation that is necessarily inherent to created nature, for God to gift this freedom from necessity, God's very being must exist as this freedom from the necessity of nature (Zizioulas 1985: 43). Divine freedom, for Zizioulas, is already revealed in the communion with God in Christ by the Holy Spirit. Theology must find the proper categories to give expression to the Trinitarian being of God as communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to express faithfully God's being as communion revealed in the Eucharistic experience of God in Christ, the Cappadocian Fathers, according to Zizioulas, made two crucial moves: first, they insisted on the monarchy of the Father, which consisted of the second ‘leavening’ of Greek ontology. The monarchy of the Father affirms that the ‘cause’ of God's Trinitarian being is the person of the Father. In grounding the being of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 336) </b>God, and thus all being, in the person of the Father, the Cappadocian Fathers affirm that God's Trinitarian being does not result from the necessity of God's nature identified as love, or the diffusive good, or the One, but is an event of freedom. As Zizioulas puts it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">[i]n a more analytical way this means that God, as Father and not as substance, perpetually confirms through ‘being’ His  <i class="calibre4">free</i> will to exist. And it is precisely His Trinitarian existence that constitutes this confirmation: the Father out of love—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is, freely—begets the Son and brings forth the Spirit. If God exists, He exists because the Father exists, that is, He who out of love freely begets the Son and brings forth the Spirit. Thus God as person—as the hypostasis of the Father—</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes the one divine substance to be that which it is: the one God. (Zizioulas 1985: 41)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such an affirmation is an ontological revolution, because for the first time in the history of philosophy, ontology is not associated with sameness and necessity, but with freedom, particularity, otherness, and personhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second crucial move orchestrated by the Cappadocian Fathers was to link the philosophical categories of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> and  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> in order to give an adequate account of the Trinitarian being of God (Zizioulas 1985: 27–49).  <i class="calibre4">Hypostasis</i> by itself would lead to tritheism, while  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> smacks of Sabellianism. Uniting the categories allows for the affirmation of the irreducibility of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, while simultaneously asserting that this hypostatic existence is a relational event. In terms of the monarchy of the Father, the person of the Father is Father as ‘cause’ of the Son and the Spirit; thus, the person of the Father is constituted as such only in relation to the Son and the Spirit. For Zizioulas, then, personhood, both human and divine, is an event of freedom ( <i class="calibre4">ekstasis</i>) in a communion that constitutes one as irreducibly particular and irreplaceable ( <i class="calibre4">hypostatic</i>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">One cannot fail to recognize the general lines of Lossky's theology of personhood, even if Zizioulas never explicitly credits him for these insights (Papanikolaou 2008). Zizioulas’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">own emphasis on ontology, however, is a clear break with Losskian apophaticism, especially when Zizioulas affirms that the experience of God in the Eucharist is one of the immanent Trinity, which then forms the basis of a Christian Trinitarian ontology. In concep</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> tualizing divine–human communion, Zizioulas also makes central the category of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>, specifically the  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> of Christ, rather than the divine energies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zizioulas’ interpretation of the Cappadocian Fathers’ reworking of the philosophical categories of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> and  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> has recently come under attack, especially by patristic scholars (Behr 2004; Ayres 2004). Although there may be some merit to the claim that the Cappadocian Fathers did not explicitly set out to revolutionize ontology, Zizioulas’ understanding of personhood as a relational event of freedom and uniqueness is logically implied in the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, especially if this doctrine is governed by the grammar of divine–human communion. If the reworking of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> and  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> emerges against the background of a grammar of divine–human communion, then  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> and  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> are appropriated so as to indicate distinctions within God that would allow for communion with the ‘true’ God in the person of Son; the language of  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> simply cannot do that work. Within the context of the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 337) </b>grammar of the doctrine itself,  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> and  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> emerge in order to make sense of the God who in love and freedom is incarnate in Jesus Christ. More problematic for Zizioulas is his grounding the being of God in the freedom of the Father, which raises the question of whether the Son and the Spirit possess the same freedom as the Father, and thus, are persons in the same way as the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In spite of their theological differences, Bulgakov, Lossky, and Zizioulas agree that the doctrine of the Trinity is grounded in the experience of divine–human communion in Christ by the Holy Spirit. Each in his own way highlights a strand within the patristic tradition: Lossky rightly emphasizes that knowledge of God is not propositional but an experience of union, so that Trinitarian theology is inevitably apophatic and is itself an ascetical exercise whose goal is to give expression to the Christian understanding of God in such a way that guides the ascetical struggle to God; both Zizioulas and Bulgakov see clearly the revolutionary ontology Christians were declaring in the doctrine of the Trinity and attempt to advance the implications of early Christian thinking on the Trinity—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zizioulas on  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>, and Bulgakov with his interpretation of the  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> as Sophia. The way forward for a contemporary Orthodox theology on the Trinity is not to oppose these three trajectories, but to integrate their best insights into a theology of the Trinity that is faithful to the impulse of early Christian thinkers on the Trinity, and that delineates the wider cultural, economic, and political implications of the Christian belief in a God whose being is communion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines the extent to which the Christian doctrine of God as Trinity has gained intelligibility in the light of the philosophy that has predominated in the English-speaking academy for the last fifty years. It highlights the surprisingly limited interactions of theologians with the analytic philosophy that has dominated English-speaking universities for the past half-century. It suggests that analytic philosophy has had little obvious impact in Christian theology and mentions the emergence of “analytic theology”. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To what extent has the Christian doctrine of God as Trinity gained in intelligibility in the light of the philosophy that has predominated in the English-speaking academy for the last fifty years? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much fine work has been done on religious belief, the problem of evil, and so on, by philosophers trained in the analytic tradition, most of whom have had Christian affiliations (Harris and Insole 2005). Their methods, as well as their conclusions, display considerable variety. Analytic philosophy, after all, has never been a homogenous phenomenon (Martinich and Sosa 2001). Nevertheless, however much they may dissent from them, we may regard philosophers as in the analytic tradition if they take Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and suchlike, as their paradigms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Analytic philosophy has had little obvious impact in Christian theology. Even where analytic philosophy flourishes, theologians are more likely to engage with ‘Continental’ and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘postmodernist’ thinkers than with the local philosophers, often to the dismay of the few with religious commitments. Of course, in divinity schools where modern Christian theol</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy</b> ogy is studied, favoured research subjects such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner, and Hans Urs von Balthasar do not attract theologians who are interested in analytic philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the phrase ‘analytic theology’ has recently entered the literature (Crisp and Rea 2009). According to the editors, analytic theology favours clarity, rigour, and brevity. This is less informative than it might seem. From Aristotle to Spinoza, arguably at least, such exemplary virtues are often evident. Moreover, while the Crisp and Rea volume contains no treatment specifically of the Trinity, it is suggested that, in accordance with  <b class="calibre3">(p. 340) </b>the ideals of analysis, we might, for example, expect that the problem of God's being both one and three would be dealt with most illuminatingly by breaking it up into parts: considering separately what we mean by such concepts as ‘nature’, ‘person’, ‘relation’, and so on, and then displaying the interconnections. By this measure, one might object, any theologian who analyses the concepts in the doctrine as declared in the Creed, rather than aiming at a critical-historical reconstruction of the New Testament evidence, would count as </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘analytic’—like Thomas Aquinas, for one. Indeed, as Crisp and Rea allow, one likely objection to the very idea of analytic theology, namely that it would favour analysis of concepts over history of doctrine, is, as it happens, a long-standing criticism of analytic philosophy itself, allegedly indifferent to history. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Light from Logicians</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While the phrase ‘analytic philosophy’ had not yet become standard, theologians in the 1980s were beginning to appeal to what would then have still been described as ‘linguistic analysis’, ‘ordinary language philosophy’, or perhaps ‘Oxford philosophy’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David Brown, then at Oxford, was the first to deal with the Trinity, explicitly as an extension of the philosophy of religion into what he called ‘philosophical theology’ (Brown 1985). He distinguished ‘Anglo-Saxon philosophy’ from ‘Continental’. He had no reason to cite Frege or Wittgenstein. He cited Russell twice, though only for his ignorantly anti-Christian polemics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Russell, however, was cited with approval by E. L. Mascall (Mascall 1986). In order to cast light on Augustine's doctrine of the divine Persons as ‘substantial relations’, Mascall appealed in his last chapter—entitled ‘Light from the Logicians’—to insights about the notion of relations which are to be found in  <i class="calibre4">Principia Mathematica</i>, the ‘stupendous work’, as he called it, by A. N. Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, a foundational text in modern philosophy. (Mascall studied mathematics at Cambridge in the 1920s: he had no training in philosophy and sometimes boasted that he had no formal theological qualification either!) A relation involves two terms: to say that John is uglier than Paul is a statement about John but of course implies a statement about Paul, namely that he is less ugly than John. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘bright idea’ (as Mascall calls it) that Whitehead and Russell introduced was to interpret a relation between two terms as a predicate, but a predicate having two subjects rather than the usual one. The statements about John and Paul were taken as specifying Page 2 of 8</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy</b> their functions ‘as subjects of the dyadic predicate of comparative ugliness’. Russell later generalized the insight to include relations between more than two terms, and predicates having more than two subjects. He noted relations of three terms, which he called ‘triadic’. Moreover, he saw no theoretical limit to the series of kinds of relations. Mascall dwells on Russell's example of a ‘pentadic’ relation: ‘A minds B's love for C more than D's hatred of E’. This sentence has the single grammatical subject A. Its meaning could be expressed in several other ways but each of these will have a single grammatical subject: <b class="calibre3">(p. 341) </b>for example, ‘C annoys A more by being loved by B than D does by hating E’. Each element of this pentadic relation can function as subject, yet it exists at all only in virtue of its relation with the other four. Mascall's suggestion is that, with all proper caution, this analogy casts decisive light on our understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity: ‘we should consider the three divine Persons as the three subjects of a concrete triadic relation by which God exists as supreme reality in Trinitarian being’. In other words: ‘In this triadic relation each of the subjects has his own uninterchangeable place, function and contribution, yet each exists and functions only in view of his relation as co-subject with the other two’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, according to Mascall, this understanding of the triadic relation of the divine Persons excludes both subordinationism and such emphasis on the equality of the Persons that we settle for ‘the image of the Trinity as a council of three with equal voting powers’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, the age-old temptation to incline either to modalism or to tritheism would be eliminated if we accepted this insight from  <i class="calibre4">Principia Mathematica</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Wittgensteinian Exchanges</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">David Brown was trained in ancient philosophy. The two Oxford philosophers to whom he pays tribute in his book were already recognized, one as an Aristotle scholar (David Charles) and the other as an opponent of physicalism (Howard Robinson). Thus, ‘Anglo-Saxon philosophy’, as Brown knew it, was neither indifferent to ancient philosophy nor dismissive of metaphysical idealism. It was not a residue of logical positivism, let alone </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘talk about talk’. Brown placed his book under the patronage of his Oxford predecessors John Henry Newman and Joseph Butler: Butler in particular for inspiring his opposition to </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘deism’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown argues against the ‘deism’, which he finds in the work of his Anglican colleagues, Denis Nineham and Maurice Wiles, and also in that of the Catholic theologian Edward Schillebeeckx. According to these theologians, Brown reports, God should never be said to ‘intervene’. While Brown admires Schillebeeckx's emphasis on the key role played by </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘experience’ in the emergence of Christian faith, he regrets his failure to accord proper recognition to divine initiative: ‘revelation as dialogue’. Brown would happily redescribe his ‘interventionist’ account of God as ‘interactionist’ (Brown 1986: 264). Over and above God's general ordering of the world, which ‘deists’ acknowledge, we must allow for certain specific divine actions—‘interventions’. The doctrine of the Trinity, in Brown's view, depends for its existence and justification on certain key ‘experiences’: specifically, what Page 3 of 8</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy</b> happened to the original disciples at the Resurrection and the subsequent gift made to them of the Holy Spirit. For Brown, these two fundamental Christian experiences belong, whatever their uniqueness, to categories of religious experience that are exemplified extensively outside as well as in Scripture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appeal to ‘experience’, in Brown's account of the doctrine of the Trinity, attracted objections by Kenneth Surin (Surin 1986). This argument from religious experience begs <b class="calibre3">(p. 342) </b>the question of ‘radical interpretation’, according to Surin, who then appeals to claims by Quine, Davidson, and especially Wittgenstein. Brown accepts that we have certain ‘raw’ experiences, overlaid by an interpretation, which can be peeled off, so the charge runs, whereas of course Wittgenstein's ‘private language’ argument shows that no such ‘experience’ exists independently of linguistic practices. Secondly, according to Surin, the divine Trinity in Brown's book turns out to be three ‘entities’, endowed with </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘three distinct centres of consciousness, each with its own mental content’, indeed having </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘different mental histories’, such that the triune Godhead is ‘more like a family than an individual’. Brown's ‘cognitional positivism’ and ‘tritheism’ are only the first two objections in quite a lengthy series that Surin advances. While granting that Brown's book is ‘a first-rate piece of philosophical theology’, Surin judges that it does not ‘even begin effectively to articulate the very profound and complex problems and paradoxes’ that have been confronted over the centuries in regard to the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his response Brown defends the social as against the psychological model for the Trinity. Augustine left the western tradition with a doctrine of divine unity, inherited from his Neo-Platonism. Admission of plurality must entail divisibility and thus imperfection. While Surin brings Wittgenstein's private language argument against Brown's notion of ‘experience’, Brown counters with Wittgensteinian therapy for this obsession with simplicity. As Wittgenstein reminds us, whether we judge something composite or simple is a matter of context, not determinable absolutely. We use the word ‘composite’, and therefore the word ‘simple’, ‘in an enormous number of different and differently related ways’. As regards the doctrine of the Trinity, as in a thousand other cases, it all depends on the perspective from which a question is raised. As Brown concludes: ‘there is no danger in giving composite answers to certain questions provided that you are prepared to give simple answers to others, for instance in respect of whether a state of conflict ever exists between the three persons or whether the worship of one in isolation could ever be appropriate’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Brown's exchange with Surin brings considerations from Wittgenstein into play, his Trinitarian doctrine itself does not seem significantly indebted to ‘Anglo-Saxon philosophy’. The tendency towards ‘cryptic tritheism’ of which Surin accuses him, in his willingness to speak of ‘three subjectivities’ within the Trinity, is the flip side of his aversion from what he takes to be Augustine's obsession with divine simplicity. Brown's exposition of Trinitarian doctrine itself, though illuminated by the resort to Wittgenstein, negatively and positively, does not differ from a paradigm that would be familiar to theologians unacquainted with analytic philosophy. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy</b> <b class="calibre3">Bayesian Probability Theory</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Over decades Richard Swinburne has built up an impressive case for Christian theism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His earliest work as a philosopher dealt with Bayesian confirmation theory and the justification of induction. In a culture where the metaphysical certainties that once  <b class="calibre3">(p. 343) </b>underwrote Christian faith now seem implausible to many people, yet in which probability theory engages with some of the most vital activities, from statistics to quantum mechanics, it seems appropriate to assess the case for Christianity from a probabilistic perspective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Swinburne argues, that God exists is the hypothesis that explains why there is a world at all, why there are the scientific laws that there are, and why animals and then human beings have evolved as we have. It makes better sense of our experience than any other explanation—good grounds for accepting it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Swinburne has taken confirmation theory far beyond natural theology, deep into revealed theology. If the existence of persons like us makes it probable that there is a God, then this God must surely also be a person, in however modified a sense. But a person, on any definition, needs someone to love. Anyone who loves someone will seek the good of that person by finding some third person for him to love and be loved by (Swinburne 2008). Thus, if there is a God, who is a person, the doctrine of the Trinity is what we should expect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Classically, as in Karl Barth and Thomas Aquinas, the Trinity has been regarded as entirely a matter of divine revelation. Swinburne alludes to Richard of St Victor, who argued in his  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> that God must necessarily be triune, precisely on the basis of the nature of love. Bayesian confirmation theory, one of the splendours of reasoning that we have inherited from logical positivism, takes Swinburne much further in Trinitarian theology than traditional theologians would endorse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Recent Trinitarian Studies</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody trained in analytic philosophy has yet published a monograph on the doctrine of the Trinity. Several academic theologians who would not regard themselves as professionally qualified in analytic philosophy have, however, published books that we should notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nicholas Lash, in  <i class="calibre4">Believing Three Ways in One God</i> (1992), offered a brief meditation on the Trinity for ‘people educated in every area of their life and work except theology who say the Creed each Sunday and sometimes wonder what they mean’. Best known for his work on Newman, Lash (it is not surprising to find) writes lucidly and succinctly. He argues strongly in favour of our ceasing to speak of ‘persons’ in relation to the Trinity: God is not an individual with a nature, which is what the word ‘person’ naturally means. This observation might point to interest in ‘ordinary language’ philosophy. In a dozen pages of notes, however, in which Lash draws on an immense range of reading, from Scripture and Page 5 of 8</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy</b> the Fathers through Thomas Aquinas down to G. M. Hopkins and Karl Rahner, not forgetting Newman, he has no reason to mention any analytic philosophers. As other publications show, Lash is well acquainted with developments in philosophy since Wittgenstein. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Karl Barth, long ago and quite independently of linguistic philosophy, wanted us to avoid the word ‘person’. Lash's treatment of the doctrine of the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 344) </b>Trinity, in this and other respects, would not have been very different if he had never read much analytic philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much the same seems true of David S. Cunningham's book  <i class="calibre4">These Three Are One</i> (1998). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As with Lash, the clarity and argumentative rigour with which Cunningham writes need not be credited to the putative impact of analytic philosophy, to which Cunningham is in fact quite hostile. He deplores ‘the triumphs of analytic forms of thought in the modern age’: ‘The deleterious effects of theology's appropriation of certain forms of social science are due, in part, to their excessive embrace of analytical structures’. Theological discourse should resist the ‘true/false dichotomies of Boolean logic’. Cunningham lays emphasis more on the harm that analytic philosophy is likely to do in theology than on any possible benefits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cunningham severely criticizes Colin Gunton, who studied ancient philosophy at Oxford, accusing him, especially in  <i class="calibre4">The One, the Three and the Many</i> (1993), of constructing a view of western intellectual history in which a Parmenidean option for the One is played off against Heraclitean plurality, with the aim of showing ultimately that the doctrine of the Trinity is the desirable solution. Gunton's project counts among the few to revisit Trinitarian doctrine by a theologian with philosophical qualifications. The result was surrender to the dichotomous ‘either/or’ mentality—only what is to be expected, as Cunningham would think, in a climate that favours analytic modes of thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Light on Familiar Philosophical </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Problems</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruce D. Marshall, in  <i class="calibre4">Trinity and Truth</i> (2000), combines a ‘realist’ account of truth with an essentially Barthian theology of the Trinity. He engages more deeply than any other theologian with currently lively debate in analytic philosophy. What is new, however, is not what he says about the Trinity but what he wants us to see about truth. We need not—</p>
<p class="calibre1">should not—seek to justify Christian beliefs according to how far they adequately express certain inner experiences (an interiority thesis); or are grounded in self-evident data (foundationalism); or meet criteria not themselves distinctively Christian (epistemic subordination); or are bound up with communal practices (pragmatism); or agree with reality (correspondence). All this would be familiar to analytic philosophers, and amounts to a set of serious criticisms of much recent Trinitarian theology. Marshall, more challengingly, insists, as a Christian, that the doctrine of the Trinity enjoys ‘epistemic primacy’, which means that any philosophical account of truth, which turns out to be in contradiction with Christian faith, should be discarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 8</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology in the Light of Analytic Philosophy</b> A. N. Williams offers an equally challenging thesis (Williams 2005). In analytic philosophy of religion, particularly regarding whether God exists, arguments for and against regularly assume an identity for the one whose existence is in question. Given an orthodox affirmation of the doctrine of the divine Trinity, however, we should be clear  <b class="calibre3">(p. 345) </b>about the problems in speaking of ‘God’. Since the word ‘God’ cannot designate only one person of the Trinity, nor the three together, nor divine nature generically conceived, so she argues, drawing on patristic scholarship, it would be best to avoid the word altogether in Christian discourse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus Marshall and Williams show how the doctrine of the Trinity, classically understood, may impact on central questions in analytic philosophy. As regards the impact of analytic philosophy in any substantial way on the doctrine of the Trinity, however, we must await the development of analytic theology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article considers the doctrine of Trinity as Christian teaching. It mentions that the eventual authoritative teaching about the Trinity that developed over the first five centuries or so of the Common Era has often been understood by modern theologians to be the product of arcane theological speculation beyond the biblical witness. It shows that the dogmatic place of the Trinity arose in the early Church from reading the New Testament's testimony to the relationships and activities of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It explains that what came to be authoritative Christian teaching about the Trinity involves the convergence of biblical interpretation and theological pressures fundamental to Christian concerns about salvation in Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, Christian teaching, Common Era, biblical witness, New Testament, Holy Spirit, biblical interpretation, theological pressures, salvation in Christ THE eventual authoritative teaching about the Trinity that developed over the first five centuries or so of the Common Era has often been understood by modern theologians to be the product of arcane theological speculation beyond the biblical witness. The theological consensus about the Trinity that emerged with great struggle from the early ecumenical councils—that God is made up of three permanently distinct but equally divine persons, inseparably united or one in both being and action—can easily appear to modern Christians to be primarily a way of addressing abstruse theological questions about unity and diversity within the Godhead and therefore to be of only tangential significance to either basic Christian beliefs or a biblically based faith in Christ. By returning to these first few centuries, this chapter shows, to the contrary, how what came to be authoritative Christian teaching about the Trinity involved the convergence of biblical interpretation and theological pressures fundamental to Christian concerns about salvation in Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The New Testament does not itself of course offer the sort of highly elaborated Trinitarian theology worked out by theologians over subsequent centuries. But this should not be taken to mean that these later theologians were engaged in some simply self-contained theological effort to figure out the presuppositions and implications of their post-biblical Page 1 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">theological starting points—for example, to determine how belief in the full divinity of Christ could be reconciled with monotheism. These theologians were all thoroughly occupied at the same time with New Testament exegesis in particular. Once the divinity of Christ and, later on, of the Holy Spirit were broached as matters for serious concern, theological controversies naturally erupted over what the New Testament suggested about the divinity of what are called there Father, Son, and Spirit—about the way in which they were divine, in and of themselves and in their relationships with one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this biblical interpretation formative of Trinitarian reflection theologians hardly restricted themselves to the bare formulas, quite few in number, that are often the first <b class="calibre3">(p. 350) </b>places modern theologians look for biblical references to the Trinity—for example, Matt. 28:19 calling for baptism in the name of Father, Son, and Spirit. These theologians instead ranged very widely in their biblical interpretation, concentrating on a whole raft of passages in the New Testament where relations among Father, Son, and Spirit seemed to them to be the subject of either direct discussion or narration in some detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes this involved drawing Trinitarian conclusions from what Jesus is reported in the Gospels to have said—about his relations with the Father, for example, in the Farewell Discourses of the Gospel of John. And often this meant lifting such passages out of the story-line and viewing them in the abstract as theological statements with direct Trinitarian import, in ways that might seem peculiarly inattentive, perhaps even distortive of the Gospel narration of Jesus’ life and work. Even were one to bring to the Bible a fully developed account of the Trinity, one can, for instance, give a far more obvious theological interpretation of the content of Jesus’ Farewell Discourses than a Trinitarian one by attending to the immediate context of the story of which they are a part. When Jesus talks about his disciples being one with one another, and with the Father as he and the Father are one, that could very well simply mean, ‘I am carrying on with the mission set for me by the Father no matter how hard the road has become; and you should, too, as my disciples’. The unity of the Trinity is not, in any direct way at least, the obvious subject matter here if one is bothering to attend to the story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But these theologians also typically made a very careful study of the various narrated story-lines of the Gospels—in all four Gospels and extending from there into Acts and the Pauline Epistles—when drawing conclusions of a Trinitarian sort. So, for example, in the narrated action in which Jesus prays to the Father, in the Farewell Discourses and elsewhere, something is directly suggested, according to these theologians, about the relationship between Son and Father, irrespective of what Jesus is reported to have said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What they view as narrated relationships among Father, Son, and Spirit are indeed central to the way these theologians support in biblical terms the basic affirmations of what becomes the Christian Trinitarian consensus: the persons of the Trinity are distinct from one another, equal to one another, and, in the strongest possible senses, one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the Word that becomes flesh in Jesus is taken by these theologians to be clearly distinct from the Father and Spirit because in the Gospel stories Jesus talks to the former and sends the latter. Jesus is not then the mere epiphany of the one he calls Father, a Page 2 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">mere manifestation of him for certain purposes, but must represent a distinct divine principle in his own right in relation to the Father. Quite a number of scriptural passages suggest to them that Father, Son, and Spirit do not have interchangeable places in relationship to one another and for that reason are clearly distinct from one another. For example, the Son prays to the Father and the Father does not pray to the Son, the Son is sent by the Father and not the Father by the Son; the two cannot therefore be the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A host of other New Testament passages, however, suggest an equivalence of power and status among the three. For example, Father, Son, and Spirit are taken to be perfectly equal in power to one another in virtue of the reciprocal relationships that hold among them. By taking on the same roles or functions with respect to one another, their equivalent status is also established. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 351) </b>Their revealing one another is an example of such a reciprocal relationship. On the one hand, in the life of the Son incarnate in Jesus Christ the liberating character of the Spirit's work becomes apparent (Lk. 4:18–21); on the other hand, the Spirit is the one who makes the Son known (1 Cor. 12:3). The same relationship of mutual revelation, as a synopsis of the narrated Gospel, holds for Father and Son: ‘No one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son’ (Lk. 10:22). They also form mutual paths of access to one another: ‘No one comes to the Father except through the Son, because we cannot know the Father, unless faith in the Son is active in us, since we cannot approach the Father in worship, unless we first adore the Son, while if we know the Son, the Father draws us’ (Hilary 1994: 213). And they glorify one another. The Son glorifies or brings honour and renown to the Father by doing the glorious works of the Father for us but only because the Father has first glorified the Son by handing over to him their performance (Jn 17:1–4). Glorifying the one is therefore the equivalent of glorifying the other. To glorify the Son for what he accomplishes is to glorify the Father since the Son's own glory is from and of him; and the reverse, to glorify the Father for his goodness to us is to glorify the Son who carries it out. Indeed, the Father, Son, and Spirit are inseparable equivalents of one another in power and status in virtue of the way they generally appear </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘in’ one another, as these theologians like to say, following Jn 17:21. Thus, the love of the Father for us is manifest in what the Son does, in much the way a ray of light makes clear in itself the character of its source. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father, Son, and Spirit seem to belong to one another and therefore to be nothing without one another. The Son is specifically the Son of this Father—his ‘only son, full of grace and truth’ (Jn 1:14; see also Heb. 1:5). And the Father is the Father of this particular Son, ‘my Father’ (Lk. 2:49; Mk 14:36; Matt. 11:25)—and only thereby ours—‘my Father and [therefore] your Father’ (Jn 20:17). Who Jesus is as Son and who the Father is as Father are determined by their particular relationship with one another. This is no general relationship of sonship which includes both Christ and us, but a unique relationship between the two of them which we come to share in virtue of our connection with this one Son (1 Cor. 1:9; Rom. 8:29) (Athanasius 1957a: 441). In much the same way, the Spirit is specifically the Spirit of this Father (Jn 15:26; 1 Cor. 2:11–12) and as such the Spirit of this particular Son Page 3 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">also (Gal. 4:6; Jn 14:26); and only thereby ours (Jn 20:22; 1 Jn 3:24). It is in virtue of their relations with one another that they are what they are, in full mutuality of co-implication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole story of the Gospel is taken, moreover, to be their working a single action of salvation together, through equivalently divine capacities; they each act but always jointly by the very same powers for the very same end. Thus, the Father does nothing without the Son; the working and words of the Father appear in what Jesus himself does and says (Jn 6:45–6). ‘The Father teaches through the words of the Son, and though seen of none, speaks in the manifestation of the Son’ (Hilary 1994: 172). And the Son does only the will of his Father—not his own will in any contrast to it (Jn 5:19). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the act of saving us remains each of theirs. In speaking the Father's words, for example, Jesus is not merely speaking the words of another as a mere prophet might, but speaks of himself his own words (Jn 14:10). ‘The Father works in the Son; but the Son <b class="calibre3">(p. 352) </b>also works the works of the Father’ (Hilary 1994: 135). The Son, in other words, is no mere conduit for the activity of the Father, but an active agent himself of the mission upon which the Father sends him, holding in himself the divine capabilities necessary for its achievement: ‘All things have been handed over to me by my Father’ (Lk. 10:22; Matt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">11:27); ‘all that the Father has is mine’ (Jn 17:10); and therefore the Son himself exercises the Father's powers of jurisdiction. The Son carries out what the Father performs, raising us, for example, from the dead, and he is able to do so himself because he has ‘life in himself’ from the Father (Jn 5:26). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, ‘there is from the Father one grace which is fulfilled through the Son in the Holy Spirit’ (Athanasius 1951: 94). Each one works together as the very same one God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all’ (2 Cor. 13:13)…. The Apostle does not mean that the things which are given are given … separately by each Person, but that what is given is given in the Triad, and that all are from the one God. (Athanasius 1951: 142)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In their saving acts, Father, Son, and Spirit do not show up as replacements or stand-ins for one another, but each brings about the very presence and action of the others. Thus, in the actions of the Son one sees the Father; in the Son one has access to the Father. The Son does not replace the Father as his emissary. The Father works where the Son works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself’ (2 Cor. 5:19). As Athanasius deduces from Jn 14:10 (‘the Father who dwells in me does his works’), ‘what things the Son then wrought are the Father's works’ (Athanasius 1957a: 396). Rather than being a substitute for the Father, Christ is himself the power of the Father himself, Gregory of Nyssa concludes following 1 Cor. 1:24 (Gregory of Nyssa 1994: 187). Instead of standing between us and the Father as some sort of buffer zone, in Christ we gain access to the Father, enter into the very presence of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When we learn to know the Son, God the Father calls us; when we believe the Son, the Father receives us; for our recognition and knowledge of the Father is in the Son, who shows us in himself God the Father, who draws us, if we be devout, by his fatherly love into a mutual bond with his Son. (Hilary 1994: 213) Even though Jesus seems to send the Spirit to take his place, in his apparent absence, when we are enlightened by the Spirit, it is Christ who in him enlightens us…. We, receiving the Spirit of Wisdom, have the Son and are made wise in him…. When we are quickened by the Spirit, Christ himself is said to live in us…. So Paul declared that the works he worked by the power of the Spirit were the works of Christ: ‘For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me … in the power of the Holy Spirit’. (Athanasius 1951: 111–13) The scriptural passages suggesting the irreducible distinctiveness of the persons have to be put together in some way with those suggesting their inseparable unity, and therefore these theologians show special interest in individual passages that seem to model how to do this. Jn 10:30 (‘The Father and I are one’) is one example. Augustine explains: ‘He did not say, I am the Father, or I and the Father  <i class="calibre4">is</i> one [person]. But … hear both “one” … and </p>
<p class="calibre1">“are”…. If  <b class="calibre3">(p. 353) </b>“one” … then not different; if … “are” then both the Father and the Son’ (Augustine 1993: 91). Jn 14:10 is another. Hilary comments: ‘There cannot be one person only, for he speaks not of himself; and conversely, they cannot be separate and divided when the one [the Father] speaks through the voice of the other [the Son]’ (Hilary 1994: 135). The persons of the Trinity are, in short, distinct yet inseparable—a very basic claim of Trinitarian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this putting together of the one set of passages (concerning their non-interchangeable relations of distinction) with the other set (showing their equality and unity) also has rather more sophisticated theological consequences. The messages of both sorts of passage will be true if Father, Son, and Spirit are and do the very same thing through the very same divine powers, but in different, non-interchangeable manners or fashions. For example, the Father appears in the actions of the Son; and the Son, in the Father's mission to and for us. These are reciprocal relations of co-inherence or co-appearance. But for non-interchangeable reasons: the former holds because the Father is the Son's source or sender; the latter because the Son comes from him, is the one sent by him. In short, for the Trinity generally, ‘The Father is in the Son, for the Son is from the Father; the Son is in the Father, because the Father is his sole origin’ (Hilary 1994: 62–3). As Gregory of Nyssa makes the point:</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I am in the Father and the Father is in me’, each of course being in the other in two different senses; the Son being in the Father as the beauty of the image is to be found in the form from which it has been outlined; and the Father in the Son, as that original beauty is to be found in the image of itself. (Gregory of Nyssa 1994: 94)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By showing how the persons of the Trinity are able to be one and equal while retaining their distinctiveness, remarks like these clarify how to reconcile both sets of passages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The major problem for this sort of reading of the New Testament in line with an eventual consensus in Christian Trinitarian teaching is the appearance in the Gospel stories of inferiority and subordination in relations between Son and Father: Jesus talks about the Father as one greater than himself (Jn 14:28), he seems to do the Father's will with some reluctance since it involves his own suffering and death (Matt. 26:39; Mk 14:35–6; Lk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">22:42), he obeys the Father in apparent subservience to the will of another (e.g. Jn 5:19), worships and prays to the Father for help, and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit's influence on Jesus could also suggest the inferiority and subordination of the Son. At the baptism in the Jordan that begins Jesus’ public ministry, the Spirit of the Father comes down (Lk. 3:22; Mk 1:10–11) and rests or remains upon Jesus’ own humanity (Jn 1:32), to be the operative power of his own ministry. He is apparently called a beloved son in these passages for that reason; and might therefore be thought the son of God in a way comparable to any merely human anointed favourite or minister of God such as a prophet or a king. Only as empowered by the Spirit can Jesus undertake the mission of the Father over the course of his life and death. It is as one ‘filled with the power of the Spirit’ (Lk. 4:14) that Jesus ministers to the sick, the blind, and the captive (Lk. 4:18; Matt. 12:18, following Isa. 61:1). The Spirit, in short, appears to give Christ the ability to work the mission upon which he has been sent. The Spirit, moreover, seems to be leading (Matt. <b class="calibre3">(p. 354) </b> 4:1) or even driving (Mk 1:12) Jesus where he does not want to go, perhaps ultimately to his own death, but certainly into the wilderness where his trust in the Father and commitment to his mission from the Father are subject to an early testing. Indeed, the total orientation of Jesus’ life and death in obedience to the Father is shored up through the Spirit. He does the Father's will completely—his very food is to do the will of the one who sent him and to accomplish his work (Jn 4:34)—as someone empowered by it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of the Son's subordination to the Spirit can be countered by a certain degree of reciprocity in their relationship. If Jesus’ ministry is dependent upon the power of the Spirit, the efficacy of the Spirit in our lives at least seems equally dependent on the Son's agency: the Son is the one who sends the Spirit to us (e.g. Lk. 11:11–13). If the Son is led by the Spirit, where the Spirit leads is back to the Son: empowered by the Spirit we are to lead a life like Christ's. The Spirit makes Christ present within us (1 Jn 3:24) and conforms us to Christ's own mind and manner of living (1 Cor. 2:10–16). The Spirit could be itself viewed as subordinate to the Son, in short, in that the Spirit enters the world for the sake of furthering the Son's own mission from the Father of making us like the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a similar ability to appeal to reciprocity in the New Testament narration of relations between Son and Father, early Church theologians commonly avoid conflict with the equality of the persons of the Trinity by explaining the Son's subordination to the Father in terms of Jesus’ humanity. Jesus obeys and worships the Father in so far as he is a man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obedience and worship are appropriate stances for a human being to take and reflect the disparity of status between a creature and its God. Jesus is of course also the Son of God Page 6 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">but divinity and humanity remain distinct in him, and therefore what is appropriately said of him in virtue of his humanity should not be confused with what is said about him in virtue of his divinity (Athanasius 1957a: 409; 1951: 164). Relations of subservience are in this way simply consequences of Jesus’ humanity and indicate nothing about the fundamental character of the relationship between Father and Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A similar effort to distinguish the divinity and humanity of Christ helps allay the impression of the Son's subordination to the Spirit. In so far as Jesus is divine, Jesus has the Spirit by rights; he has the Spirit for his own as a consequence of his divine nature. Because Jesus is divine, Jesus does not merely act by way of the Spirit and under its direction; the Spirit is in him as his own power. Indeed, only because the Son has the Spirit for his own by nature is he able to give it to humanity—to his own humanity first and then to other simply human beings. As Cyril of Alexandria says, ‘the Only-Begotten Word of God imparts to the saints as it were an affinity to his own nature … by giving them the Spirit’ (Cyril of Alexandria 1874: Bk. 10, 363). And Jesus’ own humanity is at issue when he comes to have the Spirit at a particular point in his life—at the Jordan as a condition for his public ministry. Commenting on Jn 17:19 (‘I sanctify myself’), Cyril of Alexandria makes the point relevant to Jesus’ baptism: ‘And being holy by nature … he is sanctified on our account in the Holy Spirit, not with another sanctifying him, but rather he himself working for himself the sanctification of his own flesh. For he receives his own Spirit, and partakes of it, in so far as he was a man, but he gives it to himself, as God’ (Cyril of Alexandria 1874: Bk. 10, 540). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few theologians in the early Church affirm in addition that something in the Trinitarian relations between Father and Son corresponds to that of inferior to superior <b class="calibre3">(p. 355) </b> in Jesus’ relations with the Father—but without being properly characterized in those terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corresponding to the apparent subservience of the incarnate Son's mission from the Father is the fact that the Son arises from and out of the Father's own substance, a relationship that, apart from the Son's incarnation in human flesh, is one of strict equality; the Son is no less divine, no inferior, because of it. So Hilary explains what it is about the relations between Father and Son that both accounts for the subservience of the Son on the mission and implies no essential inequality of status between them: The Father is therefore greater than the Son: for manifestly he is greater, who makes another to be all that he himself is, who imparts to the Son … the image of his own unbegotten nature…. The Father therefore is greater, because he is Father: but the Son, because he is Son, is not less. (Hilary 1994: 174, 175; see also Gregory Nazianzen 1983: 312)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinitarian account of the relationship between Son and Father in this way remains in correspondence with the Gospel narration of the way Jesus relates to the one he calls Father. Indeed, these theologians make every effort to interpret the latter relations in light of the strict equality between Father and Son, so as to highlight the equality of the two even there (Hilary 1994: 206–7). Passages such as ‘the Son can do nothing on his own’ (Jn 5:19), ‘I do as the Father has commanded me’ (Jn 14:31), ‘the Father has given me a com</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">mandment about what to say and what to speak’ (Jn 12:49), ‘I speak just as the Father has told me’ (Jn 12:50), and ‘I have not spoken on my own’ (Jn 12:49) do not, in short, suggest the submission of Jesus’ will to an external command. They indicate, instead, simply that the Son's work is the Father's work, that the Father's work is the very work that Jesus does. Jesus is not trying in them to downplay his own role, by humbly indicating his inferiority to the Father, but trying to suggest his exceptional character among men—that what he is doing is by the Father's own charge. It is ‘as if the radiance should say “All places the light has given me to enlighten and I do not enlighten from myself but as the light wills” ’. The obedience of a subordinate is not being expressed here; it is as much as to say, ‘I am proper to the light and all things of the light are mine’ (Athanasius 1957a: 414). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While these theologians, as I have shown, are quite clearly preoccupied with the New Testament narratives concerning Jesus’ life and works, the New Testament certainly does not itself require interpretations like this; these interpretations result from reading scripture through the lens of a developing sense of the soteriological stakes of belief in Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly the main theological presupposition for such a reading is a firm belief in the divinity of Christ and indeed of all the agents involved in our salvation. If Jesus, and the Holy Spirit too for that matter, are not divine it makes little sense to read the New Testament narratives as fundamentally explicating the character of their divinity and the character of their relationships. Prompting at root a Trinitarian reading of scriptures is therefore the sense that our salvation is explicable only on such an assumption: given what our salvation entails, Jesus must be divine in order to bring it about. What is achieved for us by him has to be of such great moment that divine agency throughout is necessary to explain it. For example, Jesus’ life and death bring about for us the enjoyment of divine properties such as incorruptibility and eternal life. A proof of divinity <b class="calibre3">(p. 356) </b> through works is indeed the near constant refrain of early Church theology; Jesus and his Spirit must be divine because of the character of the salvation they bring (see, for example, Athanasius 1957a: 352, 355, 386, 411; 1951: 125–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the mere fact of the divinity of Christ (and the Holy Spirit) is insufficient to fuel the more specific trajectories taken by Christian Trinitarian thinking as that works itself out in the course of the sort of biblical interpretation I have summarized above. The simple claim that Jesus is divine need not, for example, pose any special problem for monotheism requiring a specifically Trinitarian fix. Most religious viewpoints contemporary with the development of Christian Trinitarianism that one might label monotheistic (for example, Hellenistic Judaism or Neo-Platonism) already included discussion of multiple, at least quasi-divine principles (for instance, angels, divine emanations, powers in heaven, or deified heroes) under the sway of a supreme deity (Boyarin 2004; Hurtado 1988; Segal 1977). Either no particular tension with monotheism was felt, that tension being in great part the result of political or juridical efforts to distinguish Christianity more sharply than warranted on simply theological grounds from both Judaism and Greco-Roman religious traditions (Boyarin 2004). Or there were other theological ways of resolving it. Apparently multiple divine principles, for example, might not be really distinct from God but mere ways of talking about God's own attributes or manners of appearance within the world, or be mere parts of God, included, for example, within God as extensions of God's own being Page 8 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">through emanation (Abrams 1994; Boyarin 2004: 134–9; Hurtado 1988: 41–50). If divine principles did have their own distinct existence, any appearance of conflict with monotheism could yet be resolved by making them strictly subordinate in being or function to the highest God—that is, clearly lesser divinities or mere minions or servants of the high God lacking all capacity for independent agency (Hurtado 1988: 25–7, 83, 90–1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian Trinitarianism seems distinctive in refusing those options under Christological pressure. The divine principle identified with Jesus is believed to be genuinely distinct from Father and Spirit and in no way collapsible into them, at least in part because of the way the New Testament narrates their relationships over the course of Jesus’ life and death. That narrated distinction is indeed taken with full seriousness: the divine principles that appear distinct in the narration are not simply distinct for the purpose of engaging in their saving work but permanently so. As the New Testament narratives also themselves suggest to these theologians, in his identification with a divine principle Jesus has his own agency and is therefore not simply the empty conduit for the agency of some other one, whether that be Father or Spirit. The divine power and will by which Jesus saves are his own, even if they are nothing other than the power and will that Spirit and Father display, indeed, even if as a matter of fundamental Trinitarian affirmation his divine power and will are perfectly one with theirs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor is the divinity identified with Jesus of any lesser sort. Maximal claims made for salvation wrought in Christ are matched by maximal claims for his divinity. Because of the sort of salvation Jesus works, his divinity must be of the highest sort; Jesus is no mere creature elevated to a divine level, nor divine principle of a lesser sort. Monotheism comes to mean, then, that divinity is not a class term; divinity is not a kind of thing  <b class="calibre3">(p. 357) </b>whose defining characteristics might be displayed by many things to greater or lesser degree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is simply nothing in between God and creatures—no lesser divinities on the way to being creatures, no creatures that are themselves something approaching God. One has to be either one or the other, because creatures and God are all that the world divides into (Gregory of Nyssa 1994: 172–3). Everything responsible for the grace that only divine agency explains is therefore just God—the Father who sends the Son and Spirit, along with the Son and Spirit sent. They must all be of the same divine rank, since God is a being without ranks, and the very same thing, if God is not a class term. If the divine principles at work in God's saving action in Christ are distinct from one another—as they clearly appear to be from the narration of that action—they are strictly one with and equal to one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The character of Jesus’ human life could easily suggest that only a lesser divinity is to be identified with him. The unusual claim, for the time, is that here the highest God has been made immediately accessible to us in the dire straits we find ourselves in. No buffer of intermediary semi-divine or more-than-human principles is necessary for God to be in contact with our suffering and sin. The very life of God is instead directly mixed up with suffering, conflict, death, and disease in the saving action of Christ. Divinity need not fear its Page 9 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Christian Teaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">own contamination or loss of honour in coming into direct contact with corruption and death in Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the sun … is not defiled by touching the bodies upon the earth, nor is it put out by darkness, but on the contrary itself illuminates and cleanses them … much less was the all-holy Word of God, maker and lord also of the sun, defiled by being made known in the body; on the contrary, being incorruptible, he quickened and cleansed the body also, which was in itself mortal. (Athanasius 1957b: 45) Divinity, in short, cannot be pollute (Cyril of Alexandria 1874: Bk, 12, 657). There is no impetus, then, to say that Trinitarian persons substitute for one another—the one doing the dirty work for another. And no reason, for that matter, to think they could take the credit from one another; they are not rivals for divine honours but glorify one another in reciprocal ways, as we have seen these theologians so strongly affirm in their reading of New Testament passages. As strictly equal beings they are present with one another as the one God, perfectly united in their saving work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article focuses on the analogous naming of divine persons and the notion of God as a personal being in the context of the doctrine of Trinity. It explores what it means to apply the notion of a person analogously to God, with particular attention to intra-Trinitarian relationship and to the creation of persons made for a relationship with each other and God. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Keywords: divine persons, Trinity, personal God, intra-Trinitarian relationship, Thomas Aquinas <b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian theology feels justified in using the term ‘person’ for God; and this in two ways actually: first, by conceiving of the name ‘God’ as a proper name standing for the personal being of God, and second, by using the term ‘persons’ for the Trinitarian hypostases in God. So God is said to be a personal being, a concrete spiritual reality, and, moreover, the Christian religion is accustomed to speak of the  <i class="calibre4">person</i> of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Both these accepted usages of the term person  <i class="calibre4">in divinis</i> seem to differ from what one has in mind nowadays in speaking of a  <i class="calibre4">personal</i> God, in contrast to, for instance, the impersonal God of Spinoza. The personal God of religion is a God with whom we can have a personal relationship, a God in whom we can trust, who is supposed to care for us and to listen to our prayers, etc. For many people in western religious traditions, the idea that God is a ‘person’ is a necessary and fundamental part of their beliefs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If God were not a person, it would be difficult to think of God as intelligent, creative, moral, or loving; and if God were none of those things, how could God be worthy of worship? To have a personal relationship with God seems to require that God is a  <i class="calibre4">person</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> However, the theistic notion of a personal God, endowed with personal attributes such as knowledge, will, purposeful action, is not uncontested or unproblematic. Outside the western religious tradition, impersonal gods are quite common. In Hinduism, Brahman is conceived of as the ultimate and absolutely impersonal ‘reality’ which lies behind the illusion we typically think of as reality. Even within the Christian tradition a growing number of people feel uncomfortable with the anthropomorphic and personalized language of the Christian religion. We hear of theologians who dismiss  <b class="calibre3">(p. 360) </b>what they call the ‘supernaturalistic’ God of traditional theism who ‘intervenes’ in our natural world from outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For many, the theistic picture of a personal God—a God who is thought of as an idealized human person—has lost its plausibility. One of the reasons might be the dominance of a naturalistic world-view, in which reality is regarded as impersonal in character and indifferent to our anthropological-symbolic categories. The modern experience of nature as impersonal makes us acutely aware that the anthropomorphic imagination of traditional religion is of our own making, in which we can no longer naively and unquestioningly believe. It is as if the traditional personal God of Christianity has become ‘too personal’ or </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘too human’ to fit into the impersonal and neutral reality of modern science. The personal (moral, benevolent) God clashes not only, in the view of many, with the experience of evil and suffering, but even more with the Darwinian message of natural evolution without purpose or intention. Creationism and its more sophisticated variant of Intelligent Design can be regarded as a—in my view misguided—attempt to restore something of the traditional picture of a personal God under the primacy of the scientific world-view. The fact remains that the whole idea of a ‘personal God’ is in crisis nowadays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what has this cultural experience, one might ask, to do with the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the use of the term ‘person’ within the context of this doctrine? Should it not be stressed that the classical notion of person, as applied to the Triune God of Christianity, is fundamentally different from the modern subjectivist meaning of ‘person’, which is more exclusively human? The Christian discourse on the three ‘persons’ in God should not be taken in the sense that there are three distinct centres of self-consciousness in God. The famous and influential definition by Locke, according to which a person is characterized by the consciousness of his/her identity as an enduring self (Locke 1979), is not very useful for the purpose of a theological clarification of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is of course true, but one might point out that it is precisely the Trinitarian idea of God which has made a ‘personal God’ possible in the modern sense. Underlying the dogma of the Trinity is, in some way or another, the experience through faith of a God who wants to be accessible to humans by bridging the distance between man and God Himself. In Christ we encounter God in a human face as it were, a God who is nearby and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘with us’. At the centre of Christian faith stands the conviction that the inaccessible mystery of God has opened itself for us, that we somehow, through his incarnate Son, are called to share the divine life of eternal bliss. This remarkable fact is peculiar to Christianity. It has facilitated the genesis of a more intimate and personal discourse of faith in which the believer communicates with God as if God is ‘somebody’ who shares the anthropological-symbolic form of human communication and interaction. The risk of this development of ‘humanizing the divine’ is, in my view, that the analogy, that is, the dissimi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> larity in the heart of the similarity between God and man, might be overlooked and neglected. By being represented in the language of religious worship as a person, not wholly unlike human persons, and by forgetting the analogy which permeates any representation of the divine, God is in danger of becoming ‘too human’, a person whose intentions and actions are in principle understandable by us. The consequence would be a fundamental loss of mystery, of the otherness of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 361) </b>In this contribution I want to reflect first on what it means, in the classical theology of the Trinity, to say that God is a ‘personal being’ and how, in this respect, the notion of analogy must be understood. The next issue which will demand our attention is the question of whether ‘person’ as applied to God signifies a  <i class="calibre4">relationship</i> and how this could be reconciled with the view of person as an individual  <i class="calibre4">substance</i>. Finally, in the last section we will make some remarks on the relationship between the Trinity and the theme of creation: in which sense does the Christian view of creation require a distinctive Trinitarian God? My guide in elaborating these questions will be Thomas Aquinas, whose view on these matters can help us to understand some of the worries around a ‘personal God’ and to clarify how we can speak meaningfully of God being personal without necessarily succumbing to an anthropological projection. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Name ‘Person’ and Analogy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When Christian doctrine speaks of the Trinity as consisting of three ‘persons’,  <i class="calibre4">person</i> does not have quite the same meaning as that intended by our current use of the term. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The specifically theological use of ‘person’ may rather impress us as quite abstract and even ‘impersonal’ in so far as we usually perceive the meaning of ‘person’ from the perspective of the ability to share in the human symbolic framework of communication and mutual recognition. In classical theology the name ‘person’ as applied  <i class="calibre4">in divinis</i> is in the first place a Trinitarian name by which the three divine ‘persons’ in God are signified: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This fact reflects the history of the name ‘person’ in the early Christian debate on the dogma of the Trinity. The Latin  <i class="calibre4">persona</i> was introduced as the equivalent of the Greek  <i class="calibre4">prosopon</i> (identified as referring to the same reality as  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>, once the meaning of these terms was clarified), used in the Trinitarian debate by way of contrast to the term  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>, which refers to the one and undivided  <i class="calibre4">essence</i> of God. Thus God is one in essence, three in  <i class="calibre4">persona</i>. The assumption is that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have a certain distinction among them, albeit not in the sense of separate individuals. But they are more than just different ways in which God works with us. Rather, each seems to have a distinct personal existence. In effect the persons are constituted by their relationship to each other. In the context of the Trinity ‘person’ refers to a centre of relationship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Granted that in the context of the Trinity ‘person’ has a peculiar meaning which differs from the way in which human beings are said to be persons, the basic assumption of many theological accounts of the Trinity is that the personal life of God is such that human persons are thought to be able—by grace—to share in that personal life of eternal Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> bliss. Thus it seems that the sense in which God's inner life is said to be ‘personal’ is not completely different from the human mode of being a person with its implications of subjectivity and interiority. To have a personal relationship with another human being implies, at least, that the other is willing to disclose his/her inner feelings and thoughts to me. The model of intersubjectivity can be rightly applied to our relationship with God <b class="calibre3">(p. 362) </b>in faith in response to God's disclosing himself to us in his revelation, although, I would say, without the typical modern romantic  <i class="calibre4">experience</i> of the inner life of the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In so far as we are all romantics, the notion of an inner personal life of God must be treated with utmost care. God is God, with a nature altogether different from that of human beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One might say, with Thomas Aquinas, that ‘person’ applies to God in a distinctively divine sense. God is everything He is in a distinctively divine way. What it is to be divine is, first of all, to be radically  <i class="calibre4">distinct</i> from the whole order of creatures. God is unique, not of the same kind as others:  <i class="calibre4">extra omne genus</i>. Thus if we name God a ‘person’, it cannot be in the sense of one of the class ( <i class="calibre4">genus</i>) of objects which are signified by our concept of person. But secondly, as God is distinct from the whole order of creatures as  <i class="calibre4">cause</i> of all creatures, He must contain within himself the perfections of all things in an eminent way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the distinction, univocity between creatures and God must be excluded; but insofar as the distinction is the consequence of a causal connection, pure equivocation must be excluded as well. The alternative is called  <i class="calibre4">analogy</i>: ‘whatever is said of God and creatures is said according to some relationship of the creature to God as to its principle and cause, wherein all the perfections of things pre-exist excellently’ (Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.13, a.5). One must assume an intelligible connection between the (human) world and God as its cause, and this connection underlies the possibility of an intelligible human discourse on God. God cannot be the ‘totally other’, since the world would then no longer be understandable as God's creation, as something which has received what it is from God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In what follows I want to give a general characterization of what—according to Thomas Aquinas—it means to say that we can name God a ‘person’ in an analogous sense. First of all a warning is appropriate against a popular misunderstanding of analogy: analogy has nothing to do with the idea that God is  <i class="calibre4">like</i> human persons but only much more perfect, thus a sort of idealizing projection of human perfections into infinity. Analogy is not a matter of ‘more of the same’, but rather ‘the same in a different way’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas formulates the question as an issue of the  <i class="calibre4">name</i> of person, thus presupposing its actual use in the religious language of Christian faith. The issue is not whether God is represented by us, through the anthropomorphic images of religious language, as some sort of a ‘personal being’ who speaks and listens, and carries out his intentions and purposes with regard to our world. The question is that of whether we may rightly attribute the name ‘person’ to God, thus whether the reality (the perfection of being a person) signified by the name ‘person’ is present in God. In contrast to the symbolic form of analogy according to which God is portrayed on the basis of analogies with human ‘personal’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">agents, the kind of analogy Thomas has in mind is founded in the ontological perfection of what the name signifies ( <i class="calibre4">res significata</i>). For him, ‘person’ is in the first place an ontologi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> cal category, referring to a certain mode of existence. In discussing whether and in what sense God can be named a person, Thomas will appeal to analogy in order to distinguish the divine mode of personhood from the familiar human way of being a person, which corresponds to how we are used to understanding personhood (whatever definition we may formulate). The consequence is that ‘person’ as it is applied  <b class="calibre3">(p. 363) </b>to God has a more formal sense, not yet filled in with anthropomorphic associations and evaluations. God might be said to be a ‘person’, but not in the way we normally think of a person with its characteristic behaviour, inner feelings, moral responsibility, etc. The point, thus, is not that any proposed definition of ‘person’ will be unsatisfactory with respect to God, and that many conceptual refinements and adjustments will be required in order to more or less overcome the inadequacy of our concepts. For Aquinas, any acceptable definition of person, in which we express how we understand persons, cannot be applied as such to God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the rule of analogy, Aquinas did not have an urgent reason to avoid the term </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’, adopted by Latin Christianity, and to look for a less unsuitable alternative, as theologians such as Barth and Rahner feel compelled to do. To avoid the misleading subjectivist understanding of ‘person’ Barth prefers to speak of three distinct ‘modes of being’ ( <i class="calibre4">Seinsweisen</i>); in a similar way Rahner speaks of three ‘distinct modes of subsisting’ ( <i class="calibre4">distinkte Subsistenzweisen</i>) (Kasper 1984: 287–9). In both cases the term ‘person’ is replaced by a technical rephrasing which one can hardly imagine being used in the language of faith and liturgy. One has to accept that by becoming part of a specific religious vocabulary terms are set apart and, in the new context, lose the linguistic transparency of their normal daily use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas argues that the name ‘person’, because of what it objectively signifies, can be attributed to God. What it is to be a person, the kind of reality we are accustomed to signify with the term ‘person’, must be posited of God. Why is this? The main reason is that ‘person’ is an ontological perfection, which as such cannot be absent in God who is the first principle of all being and, as such, the summit of perfection. For Aquinas, ‘person’ signifies ‘what is most perfect in the whole of nature’ ( <i class="calibre4">id quod est perfectissimum in tota natura</i>:  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.29, a.3). Therefore, one cannot deny God the perfection of being a person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This argument is hardly understandable without realizing that, for Aquinas, ‘person’ is an ontological category. There are ‘things’ which have the mode of being of a person; and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘persons’, such as human individuals, are a more perfect kind of thing than non-persons, such as stones, plants, animals. Why are they more perfect? Because their mode of subsistence is more perfect, since persons subsist in a rational nature. ‘Person’ is the name of those kinds of individuals who exist in their own right and who, by reason of their rational nature, act freely and by themselves ( <i class="calibre4">per se agere</i>). So personal beings form the summit of the whole of nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That we are justified in attributing the term ‘person’ to God, who as principle of all being cannot lack any perfection of being, does not mean that the manner in which God is a person is adequately expressed by our concept or understanding of person. At this point we Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> must make a distinction between, on the one hand, the claim that God is a person, and, on the other hand, the fact that God, in the traditions of the theistic religions, is represented (symbolically) as a person. For Aquinas, the issue under discussion is not whether God is represented in our religious language more or less like a (human) person, or whether the way God is represented more or less corresponds with how he is; the issue is whether the name ‘person’ can be attributed to God. This is not a matter of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 364) </b>representation but of being. From the perspective of Aquinas one must say that the way in which God is represented in our language by means of concepts, metaphors, symbols, etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">necessarily falls short of how God is in himself. What God is we cannot know and neither, therefore, do the concepts we attribute to God determine objectively what God is. God does not fall under a concept in the sense that the predicate determines adequately what He is. This radical claim underlies Aquinas’ notion of analogy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like any other name, the name ‘person’ is said of God according to a certain analogy. The general idea behind analogy is the following: we can name God only indirectly from his effects,  <i class="calibre4">ex creaturis</i>. The concepts linked to those names correspond with how the signified content is present in the finite objects of human experience. We signify things according to how they are known and conceived of by us. Now, when God is named with names derived from our world, the intention cannot be to treat God as if he is a finite object existing next to other finite objects and as in some sense comparable to them. Such names signify God according to the relationship ( <i class="calibre4">proportio</i> = analogy) in which creatures stand to God as their Creator. What the names signify, the perfection itself, is thought to be present in God, who is the eminent cause of all perfection, but not according to the way the perfection is conceived of and signified by us, since the perfection is conceived of by us according to the finite mode which it has in creatures. Thus God may be said to be a person, not according to our conception of person but in a much more eminent way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crucial thing is that Aquinas denies us a positive and direct insight into what it means for God to be a person. The personal character of God's being will necessarily escape our conceptual grasp and thus our capacity for symbolic signification as well. On the basis of the insight into what it is to be a person, that is, to subsist in a rational (intellectual) nature, we are led to affirm the presence of personhood in God, as something which is necessarily implied by his absolute perfection, but without having access to the divine mode of personhood. There is no question of theological ‘realism’ here, in the sense that our representations of God, among which the notion of person figures prominently, correspond with the independent reality of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The present debate about the theistic conception of God focuses in particular, it seems to me, on the question of whether the description of God as a personal being (who cares for us, who listens to and sometimes grants us our prayers) must be interpreted symbolically or as a coherent description of how God really is (Byrne 2003). For Aquinas, however, the issue is not so much concerned with our human representations of God, symbolic or not, or whether we may describe God according to an analogy with rational agents (what we call ‘persons’) in our world. His approach is more like this: given the fact that in the Christian discourse on the Trinity we use the name ‘person’, how can we argue that being Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> a person somehow befits God, even if the divine mode of personhood necessarily remains a mystery to us? Showing that we are justified in attributing the name ‘person’ to God does not necessarily imply that God is objectively determined in accordance with any concept of personhood. Even if the definition of ‘person’ includes as main elements ‘subsistence’ and ‘intelligence’, and God is said to be subsistent as well as intelligent, this does not mean that the very  <i class="calibre4">concept</i> of person applies to God. The concept—our concept by means of which we conceive of what a person is—necessarily falls short  <b class="calibre3">(p. 365) </b>in representing the way in which God is a person, and thus also the way in which He is said to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘subsistent’ and ‘intelligent’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas can avoid this conceptualistic realism by arguing that the very reality of being a person is included in the universal perfection of being. Where ‘being’ is found in the highest degree, entailing subsistence and intelligence, there must be ‘person’ as well. This allows him to treat the definition of person in a loose and flexible way.  ‘Person’ is defined, according to Boethius’ classical definition, as an ‘individual substance of a rational nature’ ( <i class="calibre4">naturae rationabilis individua substantia</i>). Both elements of this definition are, in a certain way, applicable to God. God is, in the first place, a subsisting reality, a concrete individual and, secondly, He is endowed with intelligence. But again: the divine mode of that ‘subsisting’ and ‘intelligence’ in God necessarily escapes our conceptual grasp. What we know is that these features must necessarily be attributed to God, ‘being the first cause of all things and exceeding all things caused by him’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.12, a.12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Aquinas, the name ‘person’ applies to God analogically, that is to say, God is person in a divine sense, which as such exceeds what we normally signify as persons. God is not like a (human) person but greater, more perfect, without a body and without bodily restrictions. We are justified in speaking of ‘persons’ in the discourse on the Trinitarian faith, but this fact as such will nevertheless not make God into a personal God, that is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘personal’ in the sense of being part of the human symbolic order of communication. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Term ‘Person’: Absolute or Relative</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the scholastic doctrine of the divine names the distinction is commonly made between names which are said  <i class="calibre4">essentialiter</i> of God and names which are said  <i class="calibre4">personaliter</i>, that is to say, names which pertain to one of the persons in God. The name ‘good’, for instance, is said  <i class="calibre4">essentialiter</i> of God, because it signifies the single undivided essence. In contrast, the name ‘Word’ is said  <i class="calibre4">personaliter</i> because ‘word’ signifies a relationship (‘word’ is related to the knower who says the word) and is predicated in particular of the second Person, who proceeds in the manner of a word from the divine intellect. Names which pertain to the divine persons signify a relationship, since each of the persons is distinct from another through a relationship of origin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, the question arises of how one should think of the name ‘person’ itself. Is the name </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’ said  <i class="calibre4">personaliter</i> of God? Thus is it the name of an exclusively Trinitarian application, or does it primarily signify the concrete essence of God? In other words, is the term </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’ in virtue of its signification an appropriate name for designating the ‘three’ in Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> God, or was it just a matter of an arbitrary decision that the name person became used in a relative manner, being found opportune for signifying the personal relations in God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">These questions are still relevant for us, and are addressed by Thomas Aquinas in article 4 of question 29 of the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> (‘whether the name person signifies a relation?’). There is, Thomas says, a particular difficulty with regard to the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 366) </b>name ‘person’ as said of God: according to Christian usage the name ‘person’ is predicated in the plural of the three in God in contrast to names which signify absolutely and belong to the essence, while at the same time the meaning of ‘person’ does not appear to refer in itself to another. One might think that the name ‘person’ is in itself an absolute name, signifying the essence, such as the name ‘God’ or the name ‘wise’, except that after the ecclesiastical debate on the Trinity it was ordained that the name ‘person’ was to be used in a relative sense in the plural, as when we say ‘three persons’. According to this view, which Thomas attributes to Peter Lombard, ‘person’ expresses by virtue of its signification the essence only, but, as consequence of a conciliar decree, the name person was to be used in a relative way to designate the persons in plural, although this relativity is not part of its proper meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Thomas this view is unsatisfactory. It must be rejected, he thinks, because on the basis of this interpretation the Trinitarian discourse of ‘three persons’ in God would be quite defenceless against the possible accusation of tritheism. If ‘person’ is a substantive name, then the talk of ‘three persons’ would lead to the heretical position of ‘three gods’. The relative use of ‘person’ as a name said in plural of the three divine persons cannot be just a matter of arbitrary decision. This relative use must be justified, Thomas thinks, by showing that the relational aspect was already part of the notion of person as said of God from the start, not something which is added to the notion of person afterwards. In speaking of God as ‘three persons’, we must avoid the suggestion that it concerns three Gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to avoid this Thomas argues that the term ‘person’ signifies a relationship  <i class="calibre4">in a</i> <i class="calibre4">certain way</i> and that, therefore, the term is especially suited to be used for the relational </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘three’ in God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is presupposed in this discussion is the legitimacy of the Christian discourse about the Triune God, three persons, not three Gods, but one God in three persons, distinguished from each other in virtue of their personal properties (mutual relationships). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas wanted to show that this discourse is as such intelligible; the specific theological use of ‘person’ cannot be accused of being a violation or abuse of the accepted meaning of person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas begins to analyse the meaning of ‘person’ by distinguishing the general term of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’ from the term ‘person’ as specifically applied to God. The meaning of  ‘person’ as applied to God may include something which is not included in the common term. The term ‘person’ in general signifies ‘the individual substance of a rational nature’. The term </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’ refers to the individual. Thomas goes on by arguing that the individual in the case of God includes a relationship. If the term ‘person’, as applied to God, signifies the individual, it will necessarily include a relational aspect. This can be explained as follows: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’ signifies the individual in a determined nature, for instance, this man or that Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> man, Peter or John. It is not man in general who is a person, but ‘this’ man. What does it mean to be individual in this way? An individual is undivided in itself and distinct from others ( <i class="calibre4">in se distinctum, ab aliis vero distinctum</i>). ‘This man’ signifies what is distinct from ‘that man’. Thus if ‘person’ in any nature signifies what is distinct in that nature, then in the case of human nature it signifies a concrete individual who is made up of ‘this flesh, these bones, and this soul’; that is, the individualizing features which  <b class="calibre3">(p. 367) </b>mark this man as something distinct from that man. So if one speaks of ‘person’ in a general sense, it signifies an individual who is distinct from others; but the meaning of ‘person’ as applied to human nature will include ‘this flesh, etc.’ because it is in virtue of these individualizing factors that this man is distinct from others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next we have to consider what is constitutive for the distinction in God. Without distinction there is no ‘individuality’ in God and thus no reason to apply the notion of ‘person’ to him. Is there distinction in God? In the sense of many individuals sharing the same nature, so that one can speak of ‘this God’ as distinct from ‘that God’, there is not. In God the duo  <i class="calibre4">suppositum</i> (that which exists) and  <i class="calibre4">natura</i> (that according to which something exists) are one and the same. In the case of God it is the divine essence (nature) itself which subsists. Now, Thomas goes on, there is distinction in God in virtue of the relationship of origin. The three persons are distinct from each other by reason of their origin. The Father is, so to say, the source, the Son is begotten from Him, and the Spirit proceeds from both. They are distinguished from each other by their relationship of origin. They are nothing apart from this relationship. This relationship in God is identical with the divine essence itself, and thus, Thomas says, it is subsistent, for the divine essence has the character of subsistence. Each of the three relationships in God are subsistent, thus having a distinct ‘personal’ existence, although there is but one essence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us bring this difficult and complex reasoning to its conclusion. There is distinction in God in virtue of the relationship of origin. The relationship in God is not an accident, inhering in a subject, but it is the essence itself. And it is the essence which subsists. So if we speak of person in the special sense of divine person, the term ‘person’ signifies a relationship as subsisting, since this is how there is distinction in God. The crucial formula appears to be: ‘ <i class="calibre4">a relationship as subsisting</i>’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas summarizes his position as follows. It is true to say that ‘person’ signifies a relation directly ( <i class="calibre4">in recto</i>) and the essence indirectly ( <i class="calibre4">in obliquo</i>). But it signifies the relationship, not  <i class="calibre4">as</i> relationship but by way of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> or substance. In contrast to terms like </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘father’, ‘son’, etc., the mode of signifying of the term ‘person’ itself is not relative. So it is likewise true to say that it signifies the essence directly and the relationship indirectly, inasmuch as the essence is the same as the hypostasis, and the hypostasis in God is signified as distinct by relationship. (Which hypostasis? For instance, the hypostasis of the Father, thus signified as distinct by the relationship of paternity.) Thus the relationship enters into the notion of person only indirectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relational aspect, Aquinas argues, is part of the meaning of person as applied to God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The term ‘person’, therefore, can be legitimately used of God  <i class="calibre4">personaliter</i>, and this in Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> virtue of its proper meaning. However, initially the term ‘person’ was used of God in such a way that the indirectly signified aspect of relationship was not yet perceived clearly. Only later, as a consequence of heresies, Catholic theologians began to emphasize the relational dimension of the meaning of ‘person’ as applied to God. This emphasis on the relational aspect of ‘person’ must not be understood merely as a linguistic accommodation of the use of ‘person’ in order to deal politically with the heresy resulting from the fact that the term ‘person’ has an absolute signification; on the contrary, Aquinas claims that the term lent itself, in virtue of what it properly signifies, to express  <b class="calibre3">(p. 368) </b>relationship. It was, thus, a matter of making explicit what was already implicitly present in the meaning of  ‘person’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Creation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditionally the themes of creation and Trinity are treated separately from each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity is thought to be restricted to the ‘inner life’ of God while creation concerns God's operation  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>. And a classical Augustinian principle says that in his operation  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> God acts according to the unity of his essence. The act of creation is thus to be attributed to God in his essential unity, not to one of the divine persons. For Aquinas this is the principal reason why the Trinity in God cannot be demonstrated by natural reason. The divine ‘persons’ possess the one and undivided creative power of God, which is common to the whole Trinity. As it proceeds from the world to the knowledge of the first cause of all things, natural reason (philosophy, natural theology) cannot reach God in his inner Trinitarian life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in the Christian tradition creation is usually conceived of in such a way that it definitely requires a ‘personal’ God. In the Christian view the world must be understood to have its origin in a  <i class="calibre4">free</i> and  <i class="calibre4">intelligent</i> act of creation. God has made all things through his intellect and by a free decision of his will. The question which can be raised is to what extent the doctrine of the Trinity sheds light on the ‘personal’ character of the act of creation. What is the link between the ‘personal’ character of God in his operation  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> and the inner ‘personal’ life of the Trinity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an interesting passage in his  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.32, a.1, ad3) we see Aquinas explicitly connecting the teaching of the Trinity with the Christian view of creation as a free and intelligent act of God. The knowledge of the divine persons, he says, is necessary for us in order to think rightly about creation. Without the Christian teaching of the Trinity one might easily fall into error as to how things come forth from the first cause. First, Christian doctrine teaches that God made all things by his Word. This excludes the error of those philosophers (Avicenna) who say that God produced things by natural necessity as if creation were a natural process of emanation. Second, Christian doctrine teaches that in God there is a procession of Love and that this Love in God constitutes the motive for creation. God produced creatures not because He needed them nor because of any extrinsic reason but on account of the love of his own goodness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a><b class="calibre3">The Divine Person(s): Trinity, Person, and Analogous Naming</b> What is the right way to think about the origin of the world? Thomas reminds his readers of the presence in God of a Word and of Love. God is a spiritual being: what he does, he does according to his intellect, through his Word, and out of Love. There is no natural necessity in God's operation with respect to the world. Not ‘nature’ but ‘spirit’ (freedom, word, personality) characterizes the way the world comes into existence through the divine cause. Why is this important? For Thomas, the thesis of creation through natural necessity would have as a consequence that plurality and diversity in the world could not be understood as having its immediate origin in God's own Wisdom. <b class="calibre3">(p. 369) </b>As ‘natural cause’ God would only produce one single reality ( <i class="calibre4">natura determinata est ad unum</i>), not a differentiated whole of many and diverse creatures ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">De Potentia</i> q.3, a.15 and a.16). Thus God would not be present  <i class="calibre4">immediately</i> to each creature in its particular character of being. The view that each creature in its proper character is intended by God is best upheld if one assumes a principle of multiplicity in God. And such a principle is the Word, in which the ‘ideas’ of all things are contained. It is a fundamental insight of Christian theology that only a God who acts through his ‘Word’ (instead of by way of natural emanation) can be thought of as a transcendent and free creator, distinct from the whole of creation and immediately present to all his creatures, from the greatest to the least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God created the world out of love for his goodness, not because of any need. ‘Need’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">would mean that God needs the existence of other things than himself in order to reach his perfect goodness. The existence of creatures fulfils then a divine need. According to the Christian view this is not the way we should think of creation and of the world in which we exist. On the contrary, we should see creation as a gratuitous act, motivated by God's love for his goodness. The meaning of creatures does not consist in playing an instrumental role in the divine project of self-realization. Creatures exist because God wants to share his goodness with others. The world exists as the expression of divine love. Only in such a world, in which creatures exist as the expression of divine love and goodness, thus not by chance or necessity, but because they are loved in themselves and for themselves, only such a world can be imagined as a good and proper place for ‘persons’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Christian theology, the teaching of the Triune God helps us to acknowledge that the world must be seen as a free expression of God's goodness, intended as such in its diversity and plurality (thus in its otherness with respect to God), and not as a deterministic effect of a natural power. The good power of the divine being is qualified by personalistic attributes of intelligence and freedom: God must be understood as a spiritual being who creates through his intellect (Word) by a free decision of his will (Love). The personalistic qualification of the divine principle has indeed important consequences for what it means to be a creature. To be a creature implies more than total dependency; each creature is constituted in its own being, is a concrete subsistent thing with a proper nature, existing in its own right. To be a creature must be understood therefore as the unity of total dependency and substantiality (Te Velde 1995). And when the act of creation results in a true personal being, a free rational agent, the unity of dependency and substantiality manifests itself by way of ‘image’: man made in the image of God, that is a person who acts through itself on the basis of knowledge and free decision of his will.

<p class="calibre1">(Translation from the French by Thomas Joseph White, O.P.) This theological treatment of the mystery of God the Father begins from a consideration of the real but partial revelation of the Father in the economy of salvation. My essay then proceeds to a reflection on two ways of knowing the Father: by way of negation and of analogy. The divine paternity is then contrasted analogically with all human parenthood; finally my essay centres on the relational character of the paternity of the Father, his primacy in respect to his relational identity, and then focuses on the use of his relational primacy for a treatment of concepts that are central to Trinitarian theology: inner-divine fecundity,  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i>, and eschatological primacy of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Indirect Revelation of the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A systematic consideration of the person of the Father presupposes the concrete form that the Trinitarian epiphany takes on in the history of salvation. The Trinity is revealed through the relation of Jesus Christ to the Father who sends him and through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The mystery of the Father as such is indissociable from an eschatological orientation toward him that animates the entire mission of Christ as well as that of his disciples. Divine revelation does not offer its recipients an immediate percep</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">tion of the Father, but places them face to face with Christ, the mediator and plenitude of revelation. The Father remains in some real sense transcendent of the mission of the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through him, the Father truly makes himself known, even while remaining radically hidden on account of his primacy. There is no other visage of the Father than the face of Christ. The unique pathway to the knowledge of the Father, then, is Jesus himself, the exegete and the way. He constantly designates the Father as both his own origin and as his ultimate destination. He comes forth from him, and he is going toward him ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 13:1; 14:12; 16:28). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 372) </b>The ultimacy of the Father in divine revelation prohibits the disciples from remaining fixed exclusively on Christ. Christ's departure to be with the Father is an integral part of his mission in respect to us. In theological terms one could say that the irreducibly Christocentric character of revelation is simultaneously ordered toward a paternal teleology. If Christ is truly the central and decisive figure of the entire historical economy of revelation, he is nevertheless not its ultimate end. Because of his divine nature, wholly received from the Father, Christ shares with the Father in being the final end of all things, but, in virtue of his relation of origin, he also always designates the Father as his ultimate source. Christ cannot retain his disciples uniquely for himself, then, since, in accord with his origin, he has the mission to send them ultimately to the Father. By Christ and the Spirit, we have at last an access to the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The person of the Father is not easily accessible to our theological consideration. As Christ says in Matt. 11:25–7, the Father is ‘hidden from the wise and learned’, and it is the Son who reveals the Father to whom he wills, especially to the ‘little ones’ of faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, theological investigation can build upon an enquiry we find in the New Testament itself, where the Apostles, who through listening to Christ and living alongside him, asked about the deepest identity of the one who sent him. To Philip who requests, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Show us the Father and we will be satisfied’, Jesus responds, ‘He who has seen me has seen the Father … Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?’ (Jn 14:8–10). The words, gestures, and works of Christ in his earthly life are all ultimately founded in and indicative of the mutual reciprocity between Jesus and the Father. The preaching and ministry of Jesus intentionally provokes a kind of Christian searching for the Father, and simultaneously makes this search possible for the first time. Conjointly, Christ firmly condemns forms of false paternalism that would impede a true recognition and acceptance of the one who sent him ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 4:12; 6:31; 7:22; 8:39, 44; Lk. 2:48–9; Matt. 23:9). The New Testament claims that there is something fundamental at stake in whether or not we come to truly know the Father. Consequently, theology has a contribution to make to this process, to the extent that it seeks to acquire an integral understanding of the mystery of God within faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How is God to be understood as Father? The error of Arius and Eunomius was to respond too short-sightedly to this question. One cannot invoke a magic formula in order to treat such a question, such as the term ‘unbegotten’. In order to avoid facile and misleading solutions, it is helpful to reformulate the question in a negative fashion: How is God the Father not to be understood? The negative formulation better respects the limits of our Page 2 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge of God. It also better emphasizes the requirement that we purify our images and reformulate our ordinary concepts when speaking of God. In order to formulate a systematic set of propositions about the person of the Father, we should begin by identifying the most effective ways of access to theological reflection concerning who he is. Our principle resources can be found in the way of negation and of analogy, through which we can come to envisage the properties of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 373) The Negative Way: The Incomprehensible </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The first characteristic of the Father is divine incomprehensibility. Contemporary theology became resensitized to the apophatic dimensions of Trinitarian theology in the twentieth century. Karl Barth emphasized this characteristic trait of the first person of the Trinity, even while developing a robust theology of divine paternity (Barth 1987). Even when he takes the initiative to reveal himself freely, God the Father always remains in some sense truly hidden, and this important twofold truth reaches its summit in the divine economy in the resurrection of Christ. Simultaneously, however, the relation of the Father to the eternal Son is revealed in the economy as the intra-divine presupposition that stands behind the paternal relation of God toward creatures. The title ‘Father’ does not pertain to the first person most properly speaking except by virtue of his eternal paternity, while paternity with regard to creatures is attributed to him simply by appropriation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Likewise, our new birth by grace also finds its primal foundation in the paternity of God with respect to the eternal Son. In developing these themes, Barth limits himself almost exclusively to a theology of the works of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>). He does not develop any real theological proposals about the Father in himself, in the heart of Trinitarian life. Outside of two or three allusions, the properties of the first person are not treated. We can nonetheless identify two ideas that are accentuated by Barth: incomprehensibility and paternity (with the latter as defined intrinsically in relation to the eternal Sonship). Both of these ideas should be retained in contemporary theology as determinate properties for a theology of God the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The theological affirmation of the incomprehensibility of the Father calls for a clarification. Strictly speaking, it is not a property of the first person alone. Rather, a common attribute (i.e. one that remains attributable to each of the persons of the Trinity) is appropriated to one of the three in a particular way. In effect, if the eternal Son was not just as incomprehensible as his Father, if he did not remain always in himself invisible with the Father (see St Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> II.5.9; St Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Super evangelium S. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Ioannis lectura</i> 1:18 (Marietti edition, no. 220)), he would not be the perfect image and revelation of the Father. The Holy Spirit also partakes naturally of this characteristic of the deity. However, the Father is incomprehensible in a primary and unoriginate fashion; the common incomprehensibility of the three persons finds its origin in the personal primacy of the Father, for he communicates to the Son and the Spirit his own incomprehensible nature. As such, incomprehensibility designates one dimension of the exclusive Page 3 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">property of the Father as the first divine hypostasis. The appropriation of the incomprehensibility of the divine nature to the Father is therefore not insignificant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such an approach to the person of the Father through the medium of divine incomprehensibility pertains to a theological  <i class="calibre4">via negativa</i>. It emphasizes the final inadequacy of our images and our concepts with regard to the first divine person. In Christian theology, such negative reflection always presupposes for its warrant a more fundamental positive knowledge of God, derived from the events of revelation. To affirm that God the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 374)</b> Father is utterly incomprehensible requires in effect that one has previously recognized him as ‘Father’, through an economy of divine initiatives of grace, and finally by the revelation of his paternity with regard to his only-begotten Son. Basically, then, to construct a theology of the Father that is truly Christian, the ‘negative way’ must always carefully be articulated in reference to the economic revelation of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Analogical Way: The Gifts of the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Once we have recognized that the Father is incomprehensible, it is fitting to try to understand the person of the Father based upon his free and uncompelled initiatives in the divine economy: the design of filial adoption, election, the call to sanctification, creation, redemption, the incarnation of the Word, the resurrection of Christ, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, reconciliation, the recapitulation of all things in Christ, and so on. All of these </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘effects’ of God refer us back to their origin, to a plenitude without limits, to a source that is superabundant. Recognition of such a source is implicit in the hymn in Eph. 1:3–14, where ‘the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ’ is invoked and blessed in thanksgiving for all the gifts that he has bestowed upon us, due to his Christological election and recapitulation of creatures. The Father is at the origin of every grace. Likewise, all of the free divine actions of creative giving and of salvation lead back in particular to his personal mystery. Spontaneously, ‘it is due to the benefits we receive that we come to know the benefactor; in effect, it is in taking into account that which occurs to us that we know imperfectly by analogy the nature of the benefactor’ (Gregory of Nyssa,  <i class="calibre4">Oratio catechetica</i> XV; Gregory of Nyssa 2000: 217; English translation by T. J. White). Knowledge of the person of the Father arises, therefore, from the economy, in which the Word and the Holy Spirit are like the two ‘hands’ of the Father, through whom he acts to our benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This process of ascending from the good gifts to the divine benefactor, and from the works to the person, bears within it a real limitation. It inevitably proceeds by appropriation, that is, by attributing a common Trinitarian operation to one of the persons in a particular way. Appropriation is a conceptual accommodation that is not only legitimate but most welcome. It is a practice found in the Scriptures themselves which helps a true affinity ( <i class="calibre4">convenientia</i>) to become manifest, between what is  <i class="calibre4">commonly</i> known of the three persons and what is  <i class="calibre4">proper</i> to one person that we are seeking to know better (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.45, a.6, ad3). Appropriation is based upon both the limits and the true resources of our knowledge of God that the revelation itself makes possible. Its usefulness is real, but remains limited, and merits to be completed by way of other approaches, no</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">tably by an analogical reflection on the Trinitarian properties of the persons, and by the regulative reflection of a robust negative theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only rigorously proper knowledge of the Father is developed, then, either in a  <i class="calibre4">negative</i> fashion, or in a  <i class="calibre4">relative</i> fashion. On the one hand, the first person is the only origin without origin, the only principle without principle; on the other hand, the Father  <b class="calibre3">(p. 375)</b> is only Father in virtue of his relation to the Son. Here we find the two essential ways toward the knowledge of the Father in himself: the  <i class="calibre4">negative way</i> (centred upon his incomprehensibility and his absence of origin) and the  <i class="calibre4">economic way</i> (centred on the relational character of his paternity). The economic way gives rise to an analogical reflection on the eternal relations of the Father and the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Old Testament the images of paternity are rather rare and are usually employed in an ‘ascendant’ fashion: the text employs human images of fatherhood and motherhood to signify the dispositions and pedagogy of God with respect to his creatures. In light of the complete revelation given in Jesus Christ, however, the revelation of divine fatherhood takes on another dimension that is analogical in the proper sense and that is more clearly transcendent (pertaining to the immanent life of God as such). From this point onward, even while presupposing this ascent from creatures to their God, analogy functions also in a descending way: the paternity of God with respect to Jesus as his eternal Son is the transcendent source of all human paternity and maternity. Now we are no longer limited to understanding what is greater by comparison with what is lesser (God seen in light of creatures), but we also understand what is lesser by comparison with what is greater (creatures seen in light of God). This is why Paul can address the Ephesians in the following way: ‘I bow my knees before the Father, whom every family ( <i class="calibre4">patria</i>) in heaven and on earth is named’ (Eph. 3:14; RSV). </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the analogical concept for paternity is employed in view of a transcendent signification in God, its use must be qualified negatively. In the Old Testament, the dissimilarity that is established between human and divine paternity is also accompanied by a multitude of complementary images, and these express other modes of human love, and other human sentiments: the love of a mother toward her child, the passion of a young bridegroom for his fiancée, the care of a wine-grower for his vine, but also the sense of disappointment, distress, anger, and so forth. In the New Testament, the multiplicity of images remains, but that of the paternity of God is affirmed in a more decisive and recurrent manner, based upon the very words of Jesus concerning his mission, and his ‘coming forth’ from and ‘being sent’ by the Father. The theological sense of the pre-eminence of intra-divine fatherhood must be preserved, then, by the use of a strong negative theology, since the dissimilitude between natural human fatherhood and the eternal fatherhood of God with regard to his only-begotten Son is much greater than the dissimilitude between human fatherhood and the fatherhood of God with regard to his creatures. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Divine Paternity and Human Paternity and Maternity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In an effort to deepen our sense of the relation between analogy and negative theology in speaking of the Father, we can profitably compare and contrast the personal Fatherhood of God with regard to the Son with human fatherhood and motherhood. In the context of the Arian crisis, the Fathers of the Church had to emphasize the difference  <b class="calibre3">(p. 376) </b>between human generation and divine generation, in order to steer clear of inappropriate projections onto the divine. They saw that the latter could, in the end, lead to an exclusion of the very notion of an eternal generation of divine life. While Origen had already interpreted the notions of emanation and generation in a sufficiently spiritual sense, Athanasius of Alexandria expressed in a thematic way the absolutely unique character of the generation and paternity that are in God:</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For God is not like man’ ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Num. 23:19; Judith 8:16): for the Father is not from a father and therefore does not beget someone who will in turn himself become a father. The Son does not come forth as an effusion of the Father and is not begotten of a father who was himself begotten. Therefore, neither is he begotten so as to beget. The result of this is that only in the deity is the Father truly father in the proper sense and the Son truly son. For in them and only in them is the Father ever Father, and the Son ever Son. (Athanasius of Alexandria,  <i class="calibre4">First Discourse</i> <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i>, 21; English translation by T. J. White) Generation, paternity, and filiation are all present in God, then, in modes that are absolutely unique and pre-eminent. This implies that it is not possible to speak of God in terms that correlate directly with what we ordinarily see and experience in a cyclical fashion: a son who becomes a father once he in turn reaches biological maturity. The relations between generation and paternity, and paternity and filiation, must become the object of a new consideration and of a reconfiguration of concepts, once we apply such terms theologically to God. How is it fitting to conceptualize in God, then, the relationship between the persons, the act of generation, and the entirely relational character of divine paternity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Aquinas articulates a theological contemplation of the eternal generation of the Son based upon a comparison with degrees of immanence that one encounters in created realities. He shows diverse forms of perfect activity that remain distinct in human experience can be said analogically to converge in the eternal generation of the Son. So while conception, birth and eventual manifest, personal presence ( <i class="calibre4">adesse</i>) are three different moments in the event of human birth, their mutual perfections are ‘superimposed’ or simultaneously identical in the eternal nativity of the Son ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i>, Bk. IV, ch. 11,  <i class="calibre4">in fine</i>). The Son simultaneously is  <i class="calibre4">conceived</i> in the bosom of the Father,  <i class="calibre4">begotten</i> as one who is distinct from the Father, and manifestly  <i class="calibre4">personally</i> <i class="calibre4">present to</i> or ‘returning’ toward the Father. We may employ a diverse palette of images to describe how a child comes into the world: he is begotten by his father, conceived by his Page 6 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">mother, who also gives birth to him; we can also ascribe birth directly to him as a subject</p>
<p class="calibre1">—he is born. These different terms are employed by the genealogies and birth narratives of the New Testament as well as in conventional modern speech. They designate both the diverse moments of the process, and the diverse agents involved who take part in human generation. Analogically, then, these multiple words can be used in convergent fashion to denote the simple act that is unique and eternal, which constitutes divine generation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ascription to  <i class="calibre4">divine paternity</i> of various actions and moments that one finds distinctly in the process of  <i class="calibre4">human maternity</i> denotes a difference between God's paternity and the human couple. In addition, in human reproduction, the child receives the human  <b class="calibre3">(p. 377)</b> nature of the father and mother (common to each of them) but not their individual personhood (proper to each of them). Therefore, the child has a limited degree of personal resemblance to either of the parents. Rather, the parents experience in the child a new being who has the same nature as they do, but who is very different to the extent that the child develops in his or her proper personality. In God, there is no duality of sexes, but there is also no real distinction between nature and person, such that the Son is—in all that he is (person and nature)—generated from the  <i class="calibre4">person</i> of the Father. The likeness between the divine persons, therefore, is infinitely greater than that which exists between any two human persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Trinitarian life, the acts of the begetting of the Son and of the procession of the Spirit stand at the origin of the relations of person to person, so that each of the hypostases is constituted by a relation with the two others. Here we encounter a unity of being greater than any other that could be envisaged, and a distinction of persons in which each is singularly unique. Paternity and filiation as such are found first and foremost in the heart of the Trinity, and the human correspondents (paternity—maternity and filiation) are participations in these perfect modes of existence that are proper to God alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, divine paternity and filiation are both inseparable from the Holy Spirit, who originates eternally from the mutual  <i class="calibre4">affability</i> of the Father and the Son and from the  <i class="calibre4">gratitude</i> of the Son toward the Father. The Spirit manifests the perfection of the divine paternity and filiation, since love is indissociable from each of these persons. By contrast, we know all too well that in human experience, paternity and filiation need not always imply balanced and loving relations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Our systematic reflection can proceed beginning from a question that is not resolved, centred upon a medieval theological dispute that is of great importance: Is God a Father based upon his pure and simple primacy, or based upon his relation to the begotten Son? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two contrasting theological answers in the western theological tradition. The desire to identify how the unbegotten character of the Father is to be understood with re</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">spect to his relational character is also discussed by certain authors in the eastern tradition, especially in the Cappadocian Fathers (see Basil of Caesarea,  <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i> I.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and I.15–16 (Basil of Caesarea 1982: 174–7, 225–9); Gregory of Nazianzus,  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Gregory of Nazianzus 1978: 210–13)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinitarian theology of Bonaventure is centred upon the notion of a plenitude of source or origin ( <i class="calibre4">fontalis plenitudo</i>), and the innascibility (or ‘unbegottennesss’) of the Father is portrayed as something primary with respect to every secondary emanation, both those that are intra-divine as well as those that are created. By contrast, in the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 378)</b> Trinitarian theology of Thomas Aquinas there is not a positive content accorded to the innascibility of the Father, and his person is positively envisaged principally in relation to the Son and the Spirit. The starting points of this medieval discussion are taken from Hilary of Poitiers and Augustine. In effect, re-read by the scholastics of the thirteenth century, Hilary witnesses to a positive conception of the unbegotten character of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">innascibilitas</i>), which includes the Father's primacy as source of all else ( <i class="calibre4">auctoritas</i>) (see Hilary of Poitiers,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> IV.32–5). Augustine, meanwhile, sees in the Father's innascibility simply a negative exclusion of any origin: the Father is he who does not proceed from another ( <i class="calibre4">ingenitus</i>) (see Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V.6.7 to V.7.8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Bonaventure, then, the Father can be conceived of as a person in virtue of his primacy alone, the fact that he is not begotten by another. Like pagan monotheists then, ‘we can conceive of the divine nature and he who possesses it [that is to say God as a subject], even if we do not conceive of a plurality of persons’ (Bonaventure,  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">27, pars 1, a.unicus, q.2, ad3). This affects our Trinitarian theology, however, when we attempt to understand the Father in relation to the divine generation of the Son. To conceive of the Father as Father (eternally able to beget a consubstantial Son) no other property is available than that of innascibility, the fact that God does not receive his nature from another. This perspective leads to a trend that is prevalent in contemporary theology: the tendency to treat the person of the Father and the divine essence as coextensive notions, and to overlook thereby that the relation to the Son is itself  <i class="calibre4">constitutive</i> of the primary hypostasis of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Kasper 1982). The theory of Bonaventure then poses a serious problem: if the simple fact that God possesses a nature that he does not receive from another suffices to give intelligibility to a notion of divine generation (unbegottenness implies fecundity), then knowledge of the existence of the Trinity could seemingly be deduced simply from a property of the divine essence, one accessible to philosophers and pagan monotheists. In any case, Bonaventure estimates that the primacy and innascibility render sufficient intelligibility to a concept of divine generation, which is subordinate to the notion of paternity. According to our manner of knowing, the Father is posited as first by virtue of his primacy ( <i class="calibre4">primitas</i>); primacy is then qualified by reference to emanations (including generation and spiration). The relations of paternity and spiration are then subordinated to primacy and emanation. The  <i class="calibre4">primitas</i> signals the inexhaustible plenitude of the divine mystery in its paternal origin, an origin that is superior to any emanation, divine or created. </p>

<p class="calibre1">By contrast, when Thomas Aquinas treats of the divine persons, he envisages a reciprocal primacy of processions and relations as characterizing the very root intelligibility of the persons. His theory has recourse to a conceptual distinction between the formal principle of a distinction of persons versus the way the distinction of persons comes to be known (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">De Potentia</i>, q.8, a.3;  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.40, a.2). Processional origins are the way to understand persons, but the intra-divine relations (which are themselves founded upon the actions of procession) are in reality the formal principle of the distinction of persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently, the negation of any origin in the Father, and his simple position as primary, does not characterize his person as such, properly speaking. Innascibility is a pure negation: it designates the fact that the Father is a principle who  <b class="calibre3">(p. 379) </b>does not originate from another principle (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 28, q.1, a.1, ad1;  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.33, a.4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For us to conceive of the Father's innascibility, then, we must presuppose some prior, positive understanding of the Father as a principle, and this prior understanding is given in the notion of paternity. Innascibility is a strictly negative knowledge that must qualify our understanding of the Father as a principle, but this notion is not formally constitutive of the fatherhood of God as such (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 28, q.1, a.1, ad4). Nevertheless, it remains a secondary property. Negation alone cannot express the characteristic dignity of a property since every negation is founded upon a prior positive affirmation (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 28, q.1, a.1, ad2). Innascibility presupposes, then, paternity. Innascibility can seem more perfect than paternity, to the extent that it signifies something that is entirely incommunicable, while paternity is given in analogical fashion to creatures. But innascibility manifests in reality the incommunicable character of the divine paternity as such: it is entirely unique and transcendent. Only God the Father is perfectly and uniquely Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking account of the medieval tradition, there are multiple ways in which we might further qualify our understanding of the first hypostasis of the Trinity. Four distinct strands of analysis can be distinguished. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> With regard to the divine economy, the Father takes the initiative in the missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> With regard to the intra-Trinitarian life of God, the Father is the first person and is innascible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> The Father eternally begets the Son and spirates the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> He therefore maintains two original relations that are constitutive of his very identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one takes into account the perichoresis, or mutual indwelling, of the three persons, it is impossible to understand the Father as holding the ‘first place’ in the Trinitarian life in a purely solitary fashion, independent of his relation to the Son and his relation to the Spirit. Rather, one must adopt from the beginning a relational conception of the person, in conformity with the Thomistic conception of the divine persons as ‘subsistent relations’. If we proceed in this way, then once the relational identity of the Father is acknowledged, Page 9 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">one must also re-accentuate the profound meaning of his innascibility as signifying a plenitude as the source of divine life in God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In every divine work, the Father is he from whom divine initiatives originally proceed, including all that pertains to the divine welfare for creation and original plan of divine adoption by grace. This is fitting, due to who the Father is: the origin of the Son and the Spirit, and the first principle of the Trinitarian mystery of God, who alone has existence without origin. This unoriginate status can only be envisaged in a rigorous fashion if one accepts to refine analogically two complex notions: that of an ‘order of nature’ and that of an ‘origin’. It is necessary to purify these notions of any connotation of compositional complexity, in order to apply them to the inner life of the Trinity without projecting on to that life (falsely) any notion of anteriority and posteriority, or of supremacy and subordination. In effect, it is necessary to conceive of the primacy of the Father without  <b class="calibre3">(p. 380)</b> disfiguring his completely unique expression of primacy; that is to say, without wedding to this an erroneous notion of the subordination of the Son and the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a first approach, in order to correctly consider the primacy of the Father, it is sufficient simply to begin from the missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit sent into the world and to ‘ascend’ from these back up to the Father, at whose initiative they are sent. This starting point is both intuitive and theologically sound. It follows from the common Biblical motifs of ‘sending’ and ‘mission’, by which the New Testament revelation turns our view from the mission of the Word and Son who is filled with the Spirit back to the Father who sent him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the Father is assuredly first in the order of origin that exists between the three divine persons, nonetheless, he is not anterior to the two other persons, in such a way that they would come to be after him, either temporally or by means of an ontological degradation, nor even simply according to a logical posteriority (see Basil of Caesarea,  <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i> I.20 and III.1 (Basil of Caesarea 1982: 244–7; Basil of Caesarea 1983: 146–9); Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.42, a.3). In our ordinary range of experience, an order that is based upon one thing originating from another usually implies a temporal sequence: it is necessary that A progressively attains to a certain state in order to then produce B. Furthermore, that which issues from a reality distinct from itself does not always possess the same perfection of being as the first reality, that is to say, its maturity and stability. In this way, we spontaneously think of the concept of ‘origin’ as implying logical anteriority in a reality with respect to that which proceeds from the original source. In so doing, we spontaneously conceive the origin as being logically anterior to that which stems from it, failing to see that both may also be inseparable and intrinsically logically connected. This is why in the case of purely relations, such as ‘double’ and ‘half’, ‘neighbour’ to ‘neighbour’, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘father’ and ‘son’, the one term of the relation cannot exist without the other, even if, in reality, man becomes a father at a certain moment in time, and is never simply identical in all that he is with his paternity. He was himself a son before he became a father, and if his own son dies before he does, he will no longer truly be a father, in relation to an actually coexistent son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">To consider the Trinity according to an order of origin without this implying any temporal development requires a sort of conceptual passage toward the limits of human thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From notions of local movement, or qualitative change, or the generation of a new being, we can retain only the notion of a relation of the origin to the term that originates, that is to say, of the principle and that which proceeds from the principle. This notion should in no way imply subordination, dependence, diminishment or ontological posteriority. Here we must distinguish then between ‘dependence’ and ‘relation’: dependence implies an imperfection on the part of the one who depends on what is prior to itself, while relation in itself implies no imperfection. It allows one to think of the mutual constitution of two correlative terms, yet without negating the order of origin that exists between them. Thus the Father and the Son are mutually self-constituting, even while the Son proceeds from the Father. While proceeding from the Father, and in fact  <i class="calibre4">precisely due to this proceeding</i>, the Son constitutes the Father as Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 381) </b>After having considered the uniqueness of the relative primacy of the Father, we can consider the two immanent acts of the Father. God the Father eternally begets his Son who is also his Word (according to the language of the Johannine prologue), truly distinct from the Father (Jn 1:1; 1:14, and 1:17). The eternal Word who is the principle of creation (Jn 1:3) has become manifest in the flesh of Christ, in such a way as to reveal to us his glory, the glory of an only-begotten Son, that is to say, who is the unique Son of the Father (Jn 1:14). When these two revealed names for Jesus Christ (Word/Logos and only-begotten Son) are considered theologically, they permit one to consider two complementary analogies for the mystery of divine generation: one derived from human generation, and another from the conception of an inner word, a Logos that in God is efficient, loving, and creative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our understanding of divine generation would be incomplete if we did not take into account an analogy from love as well, based upon a comparison to the love that accompanies any human father that is worthy of the title. In the generation of the Son, like the procession of the Spirit, the Father acts by virtue of a formal principle which is the divine nature, and in doing so communicates the fullness of his nature to the Son. Against the Arians, who attempted to subordinate the Son to the Father in arguing that the Son was created through an act of the will of the Father, the Church Fathers distinguished between the ‘nature’ of God and his ‘will’, such that the Father generates the Son naturally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in doing so they did not simply exclude willing from the eternal generation: even though he begets by nature, the Father also wills the act of begetting and loves his begotten Son. Subsequently we can say that love is not something foreign to this preeminently paternal act. The medieval theologians further reflected upon this truth. That the loving will of the Father is concomitant with the act of divine generation denotes the following: that the procession of the Word is correlative to the procession of the Spirit, who is the love that proceeds from the Father through the Son. In a pre-eminent way, then, the eternal Word must be seen as the perfect Word, that is to say, as the Logos who is generated in the heart of the Father, spirating love, and efficient in the loving acts of God: ‘ <i class="calibre4">Ver</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">bum spirans amorem</i>’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.43, a.5, ad2;  <i class="calibre4">Super evangelium S. Ioannis</i> <i class="calibre4">lectura</i> 6:45 (Marietti edition, no. 946)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the Son is generated eternally as the  <i class="calibre4">beloved</i> of the Father, so likewise the Spirit proceeds eternally as the Love of the Father for the Son. One must, however, carefully distinguish between love as an ‘operation’ and love as a personal ‘term’. The paternal operation of love that is present in the divine generation of the Son by the Father is not really distinct from the person of the Father, who exists in and as this very act of generating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By contrast, the person of the Spirit  <i class="calibre4">proceeds from</i> this same paternal operation of love, and is himself a person who is love, distinct from the Father and the Son. The Spirit therefore proceeds eternally from the Father in order to ‘rest upon’ the beloved Son. In virtue of his irreducible uniqueness as a person, the Spirit cannot be understood merely as the power of generation residing in the Father, nor as the paternal operation of love with which the Father acts in his divine generation of the Son. The Spirit must not be conceived of in uniquely functional terms or as a mere ‘indicator’ of eternal filiation, both of which constitute a form of reductivist pneumatology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 382) </b>At the heart of Trinitarian life, the Son fully assumes his filial identity because he responds to the Father. In an act of eternal gratitude, he returns the love that he receives from the Father in his own generation. This return of the Son toward the Father by way of filial love includes the return to the Father of the Spirit who is love. The Spirit proceeds from the Father and reposes eternally upon the Son, as the loving affability of the Father for the Son. However, he proceeds also in concomitant fashion from the loving response of the Son to the Father. The relation of origin of the Spirit necessarily implies, then, a movement of return to the Father, in which the Son is the principle agent of the Spirit's proceeding. The Spirit is thereby constituted as much by his return toward the Father (from the Son) as by his procession from the Father. In this sense, the Father is revealed in his primacy as  <i class="calibre4">both</i> the principle  <i class="calibre4">and</i> the end of the eternal rhythm of the divine life, through the ‘going out’ of the Son from the Father, and through the procession of the Spirit who rests upon the Son and returns from the Son to the Father. The Father is the source or  <i class="calibre4">alpha</i> of the divine life of the Son and Spirit, but this return of the Spirit toward the Father in the Son designates the Father as the  <i class="calibre4">omega</i> of intra-divine life as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This plentitude as source that characterizes the Father as a person also serves as the primary basis for the Trinitarian mystery, and is expressed in the twofold fruitfulness of divine generation and the procession of the Spirit. These two eternal acts are the only acts of the Father that perfectly express the riches of his divine goodness and power. All the vital plenitude of the Father is invested in the gift by which he begets the Son as his perfect image and loves him in communicating to him his Spirit. As principle and source, this paternal plenitude gives intelligibility to the notion of intra-divine fruitfulness, but this being said, this plenitude only exists in and as the act of self-communication. It is always understood entirely in relation to the Son and the Spirit. Divine fruitfulness is not simply an attribute of the divine essence, which could be inferred independently of one's knowledge of the divine processions. On the contrary, it is attributed properly to the person of the Father, and signifies precisely these two eternal acts of the Father: that is to say, the gen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">eration of the Son and the spiration of the Spirit. These two immanent operations constitute the proper expression of the original plenitude of the Father, such that this notion of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘plenitude’ in the Father cannot be treated apart from them, except in an equivocal sense of the term. We must be careful, then, to avoid conceiving of the unoriginate singularity of the Father  <i class="calibre4">within the immanent Trinity</i> as if the innascibility and primacy of the Father contained  <i class="calibre4">something more</i> than that which is engaged in his twofold effective fruitfulness (as  <i class="calibre4">Source</i> of the Son and Spirit). The fontal plentitude cannot be envisaged as something outside of or more than the relation of the Father to the two processions that issue from him. This kind of superiority or transcendence of the Father does not exist within the divine life itself. The original plenitude of the Father is not a potentiality of the divine essence that would find some kind of partial actuation through the generation of the Son and in the procession of the Spirit. The plenitude and fruitfulness of the Father are perfectly actualized and are entirely manifested in these two eternal acts of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the theological motif of the ‘eschatological reserve’ of the Father  <i class="calibre4">with regard to man</i> is an important dimension of revelation, and is essential to a proper  <b class="calibre3">(p. 383)</b> understanding of the economy of salvation. The original plenitude of the Father unfolds from eternity in the twofold intra-Trinitarian processions of the Word and the Spirit, but this spiritual fecundity of the Father is in turn prolonged otherwise or echoed analogously in the act of creation and the gracious gift of salvation. This new activity of giving  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> is not the result of any divine need for the creation, and does not actuate in God some unexploited potentiality that was not realized through the generation of the Son and the procession of the Spirit. Rather, this divine communication  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> proceeds from a completely free will that gives being to spiritual creatures in order to invite them into covenant with God, and in order to lead them into the sharing of the life of the Trinity. But this unveiling of the Trinity remains partial  <i class="calibre4">in via</i>, for the duration of earthly existence, filtered through the light of faith, and mediated by the resurrected flesh of Christ. Thus we await the fullness of the eschatological revelation, in which the Father will allow us to see him face to face, in his Word and by his Spirit, by an eternal participation of creatures in the intra-Trinitarian life of God. A twofold eschatological distance of the Father can be spoken of, then, one that is  <i class="calibre4">in via</i> and one that is  <i class="calibre4">in patria</i>. While we are pilgrims subject to the life of ecclesial faith, we await the final  <i class="calibre4">parousia</i> of Christ and the eschatological revelation of the Father. But even in the state of eschatological beatitude, the Father will always exist beyond that which we are given to see and receive of him in glory. The immediacy of the vision does not entail an exhaustive knowledge or total comprehension of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It remains to underscore the originality of the Holy Spirit in the manifestation of the Father. God the Father cannot be designated as such uniquely in reference to the Son. Generation and paternity do not suffice in order to characterize his identity completely. A balanced expression of faith in the Trinity requires that one take account of the uniqueness of the relation of the Father to the Spirit as one of the decisive properties of any theology of the Father. The relation of the Father to the Spirit must not be subordinated to that which exists between the Father and the Son. The Father is just as much he from whom the Spirit proceeds as he by whom the Son is begotten. The procession of the Spirit as Page 13 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p402"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">love cannot be separated, either, from the eternal generation of the Son, and is in fact intimately connected to it. In the Trinitarian mystery, then, the Father is in relation to the Son  <i class="calibre4">in the very act</i> in which he spirates the Spirit. And reciprocally, the Spirit proceeds from the Father, who is always the Father of the Son by virtue of the ever present act of divine generation. The Son is thus inseparable from the Father even when the Father is the origin of the Spirit, and yet the inner fecundity of God pertains  <i class="calibre4">principally</i> to the Father, because he is the source of the divine life. This perspective concerning the primacy of the Father, and the simultaneous indissociability of the processions, allows for a more robust understanding of the mystery of the perichoresis of the persons, and thereby facilitates a renewed treatment of the problem of the origin of the Holy Spirit: he proceeds from the Father who is always the Father  <i class="calibre4">of the Son</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However important a consideration of the perichoresis of the immanent acts of the Trinitarian life might be, the procession of the Spirit cannot be treated only due to its relation with the divine generation. The Spirit manifests a unique dimension of the person of the Father, distinct from his paternity with respect to the Son. This second  <b class="calibre3">(p. 384) </b>fecundity of the Father is irreducible to the first, even though it is intrinsically related to it. The mysterious identity of the Spirit therefore manifests something of the original plenitude of the Father that is not exhaustively expressed in the generation of the Son. The first person of the Trinity cannot be understood as Father uniquely by consideration of his constitutive, reciprocal relation with the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How then can we characterize this novel ‘visage’ of the uncircumscribed Father that is manifested uniquely by his relation to the Spirit? Here we must consider the pneumatic dimension of the economy of salvation. The procession of the Spirit is accessible to us as the agent acting behind the scenes in multiple settings within the economy: in the inspiration of the prophets, in the decisive stages of the life and ministry of Jesus, in the unfolding of the drama of the Passion, and finally in the new order that issues from the Resurrection, and which is fully unfurled at Pentecost. Through these historical moments in the economy, one can perceive more explicitly the universal extension of filial grace. In keeping with the universal influence of the resurrected Lord, the Spirit reveals himself as the one who causes creatures to participate in the unique eternal filiation of the Son in a multiplicity of ways. The identity of the person of the Father is not limited to his relation toward the Son, for he is open to new relations of Fatherhood, in the person of the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Trinitarian mystery, the eternal relation of the paternity toward the Son is conjoined to another that is more difficult to name: the relation of origin of the Spirit with regard to the Father. The paternal fruitfulness of God is realized in a properly Trinitarian communion, by the eternal interplay of these two relations. In fact, the Spirit is indispensible to the  <i class="calibre4">perfection</i> of the Trinitarian communion of the Father and the Son. In Trinitarian theology, then, the mysterious richness of the procession of the Spirit manifests that the inexhaustible plenitude of the Father is both the source of filiation and of communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The communion in God is not restricted to the Father and the Son alone, even if this procession does provide the most fundamental or structural dimension of the inner life of God. There are other modes of relationality, love, and personal exchange in human exis</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 14 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"></a><b class="calibre3">A Theology of God the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">tence that may be attributed analogically to the interior life of God, and which find better expression in a theology of the Holy Spirit. They nourish our hope to one day obtain to the Trinitarian communion of God, which is multiform but integrated, and which is perfect and unfractured, in a way that mere human solidarity and human communion are not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ungraspable procession of the Spirit constitutes, in a certain sense, the ultimate eternal opening to the Father, and proceeds by mission toward all the creatures of God called to inclusion within the unique filiation of the Son, who are thus invited to partake without measure in the ineffable communion of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the term of these systematic proposals, let us consider briefly the conclusions at which we have arrived. Despite the conjectures of Bonaventure, it is not possible to maintain theologically that the hypostasis of the Father is ‘posited’ in virtue of his primacy alone, <b class="calibre3">(p. 385) </b>nor that his plenitude as the source of all else potentially surpasses the two divine processions of the Son and the Spirit. Such a conception of God does not correspond to the God revealed in Jesus Christ. The idea of a primacy that exists outside of the effective fecundity of the Father is only a vain projection without name or personal identity. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘unknown God’, postulated under the influence of an undue philosophical influence of Neoplatonic provenance, is not the Father-God who has personally and mysteriously made himself known by way of Christian revelation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By contrast, however, the primacy of the Father can play a decisive role in Trinitarian theology, in order to denote something in the first person other than his relation to the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The plenitude of the Father as an unbegotten source of divine life is not expressed effectively only through the generation of the Word, but also in the procession of the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These two acts are ‘ontologically adequate’ to the paternal source from which they proceed. These immanent acts in God are in turn extended by emanation to the economy of filial adoption, in which creatures become the children of God, configured to the Son by the Spirit. Consideration of the primacy of the Father helps us recover a sense of the unfathomable depths of love that the Father disposes of in a superabundant way. The Spirit is the ineffable, eternal expression of the spiritual fecundity of the Father, a distinct reflection of his original plenitude. He is also the ultimate source of offering of God's divine life to the world. He completes and accomplishes the relational unfolding in God of the uncircumscribed life of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In light of this consideration of the mystery of the Father, we can conclude that Christocentrism cannot have the final word in the interpretation of revelation, nor in theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Apocalypse of St John states things clearly: it is the eschatological paternity of the One who sits upon the throne and makes all things new that gives final meaning to the mediation provided by the Lamb, even while the Lamb also partakes fully of the divine sovereignty (Rev. 5:6; 7:9–12; 21:5–7; 21:22–3; 22:1; Bauckham 1993). This is the end-point of the revelation: the Father whom we anticipate seeing. Theology then is ultimately submitted to a Trinitarian theocentricism that is eschatological. By the Word and the Spir</p>

<p class="calibre1">it all spiritual creatures are led toward personal union with the Father ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 14, q.2, a.2; dist. 15, q.4, a.1;  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.43, a.4, ad1). The interrelated missions of Christ and of the Spirit will only be fully accomplished in the  <i class="calibre4">eschaton</i> when the Son and the Spirit will introduce all of the redeemed into the eschatological presence of the Father. Already their missions attract and lead all things toward him. In our state here below as pilgrims in faith, theology must acknowledge the perennial transcendence of the Father, and, by its eschatological aspiration toward him, it must remain open to a paternal theocentrism. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This article examines Trinitarian Christology and the doctrine about the Eternal Son. It establishes the foundational dogmatic truths concerning the Son's existence as God and as man and analyzes a number of theological topics that flow from these truths. It discusses the Nicene affirmations that are central to all further teaching about the Son and explores the relationship between the divine Son and all those who are created and recreated in the image and likeness of the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian Christology, Eternal Son, divine Son, dogmatic truths, God <b class="calibre3">Doctrinal Foundation: The Nicene Creed</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ancient Christian creeds are the foundation for a contemporary doctrinal or systematic study of God the Son. These creeds provide an authoritative organic synthesis of scriptural revelation—the faith that all members of the Church profess. They were often formulated to refute erroneous interpretations of scripture and false expressions of the faith and so they clarify what precisely the Church believes and teaches. Here we begin our doctrinal study of God the Son by briefly examining the Nicene Creed (ad 325). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arius, a priest from Alexandria, held that it was impossible for God to be one if the Son is truly God. If the Son were God, there would be two divine beings brought about by change and division, all of which is incompatible with the divine nature. Arius concluded that the Son must be created as the first and highest of all creatures and so the most divine-like of all beings. Thus, God is not eternally the Father and there was, according to Arius, ‘a time when the Son was not’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In response to Arius, the Council of Nicaea declared that the Son of God is ‘the only-begotten begotten from the Father, that is from the substance of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial (∞loo≤sior) Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> with the Father’ (Tanner 1990: 5). The Council expressed seven dogmatic truths that are essential for all subsequent systematic theology concerning the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the Council specified that the Son is ‘the only-begotten begotten from the Father’, that is, as ‘only begotten’ he is singular in his manner of existence from the Father. Authentic doctrinal development and theological speculation must uphold this unique existence and specific relationship with the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, the Council clarified the difference between ‘begotten’ and ‘made’. What is made is necessarily different in kind from the maker. What is begotten is always of the same nature as the begetter. Ants make anthills but beget other ants. Human beings make <b class="calibre3">(p. 388) </b>houses, but beget other human beings. God made the world but begot his Son. It is precisely because the Son is begotten and not made that he is ‘from the substance of the Father’ and so ‘God from God, light from light, true God from true God’. The Son is God, then, as the Father is God. The Son's existence differs in kind and not just in degree from all else that exists, and all theological enquiry must acknowledge this radical difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third, in declaring that the Son is consubstantial (of the same substance or being) with the Father, the Council professed that God is one not in the sense of being a solitary being, but rather that the Father's begetting of the Son is of the very nature of what the one God is, and so the one God is the Father and the Son (and the Holy Spirit). The Council, therefore, in clarifying the mystery of God's nature refuted Arius’ claim that God could not be one if the Son is God, for the one God is not simply the Father, but rather, the one God is the Father and the Son, for from all eternity the Father begets his consubstantial Son. The consubstantiality of the Son affirms the equality and oneness of the divine persons thus rendering void any future attempt to subordinate the Son to the Father or to conceive them as different beings in their own right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourth, while the Council specified that both the Father and the Son are equally the one God, yet it also acknowledged them to be distinct persons or subjects—distinct ‘who's’—</p>
