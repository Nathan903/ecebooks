<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Liberal Theology</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The final decades of the nineteenth century were notable for the rise of a new and dominant impulse in Protestantism, liberal theology (Powell 2001: 142–72). Drawing on the work of Schleiermacher and on developments in historical criticism, liberal theologians took up a highly critical and unappreciative stance toward the doctrine of the Trinity. In this way they differed from Marheineke, Dorner, and Hofmann, all of whom saw the Trinity as a central doctrine and made serious attempts to interpret the traditional form of the doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The progenitor of liberal theology was Albrecht Ritschl (1822–89). Among his many students were Wilhelm Hermann (1846–1922), Adolf von Harnack (1851–1930), and Ernst Troeltsch (1865–1923). </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were several reasons for liberal hesitation about the Trinity. One was their interpretation of Martin Luther's theology. Luther's theology displays a twofold character. On one hand, he strongly affirmed the Trinitarian creeds. On the other hand, he objected Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> strongly to the framework in which medieval theologians had presented the Trinity, regarding it as overly speculative. In place of the medieval approach he employed a rather consistent Christocentric approach to doctrines. The liberal theologians, committed to Luther's theology but sensing an ambivalence in his views about the nature of doctrine, gave precedence to Luther's Christocentric method and downplayed his affirmation of creedal doctrines such as the Trinity. Although they were inclined for other reasons to downplay these doctrines, they felt that they were thinking in an authentically Lutheran spirit when they did so. Luther, they argued, had recovered a matter of the first importance—the fact that the chief thing in the Christian faith is what God has done for us in Jesus Christ. They further argued that Luther had correctly seen in this fact an epistemological principle, namely that doctrines are essentially soteriological and not speculative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctrines, in other words, tell us about God's actions toward us but not about  <b class="calibre3">(p. 278)</b> God's nature in itself. Accordingly, the liberal theologians saw the doctrine of the Trinity as a statement about God in soteriological terms; they did not, however, accept it as a statement of God's eternal nature. They regarded this latter sort of statement as hopelessly speculative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liberal theologians were inclined to adopt this understanding of Luther because of their affinity for Immanuel Kant's philosophy. From it came their revulsion toward the speculative approach to God and also the conviction that religion is essentially ethical. Of course, they were not slavish followers of Kant. In fact, they probably interpreted Kant in terms of Luther as much as they interpreted Luther in terms of Kant. They saw Kant as offering a philosophical account that was compatible with Luther's theology in important respects and that supported their interpretation of Luther. In particular, they viewed Kant's critique of metaphysics as supporting their Luther-inspired rejection of speculative accounts of God. They also viewed the centrality of ethics in Kant's philosophy of religion as a modern version of the soteriological impulse in Luther's theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liberal hesitance about the Trinity resulted as well from their use of historical criticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the late nineteenth century, university-based academic historiography was more than a century old. Theologians of the nineteenth century were aware of the historical character of the Bible and Christian theological history. However, in the aftermath of F. C. Baur and others, the liberal theologians were much more likely than previous theologians to find discontinuity between the Bible and the creedal tradition and, accordingly, to discount the importance of the creeds. The creeds, for them, were no longer authoritative guides to the interpretation of Scripture. On the contrary, they were seen as (to some extent) alien to the spirit of the Bible and to the interests of religion. By driving a wedge between the Bible and the later tradition, liberal theologians relegated the creeds to a position of relative unimportance. With that relegation, the doctrine of the Trinity lost its role in theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, liberal theology had little place for the Trinity because its fundamental conviction about God was a function of its Kantian inclinations. Within a Kantian framework, God was regarded as the ground of the moral order of the world. Liberal theologians condensed Kant's idea of morality into the notion of personhood, which for them was the eth</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> ical ideal. God, for them, was the ultimate person whose soteriological activity consisted in forming human persons according to the ethical ideal. But because they regarded God as a person, the idea of God as three persons was both problematic and unnecessary. Of course, the liberals were employing the term  <i class="calibre4">person</i> in a sense different from the creedal concept of person. But this observation emphasizes the fact that the issues that liberal theologians found compelling differed from those that were compelling in the fourth century. In the fourth century it was important to understand the relation of the Son to the Father and of the Holy Spirit to both. For the liberal theologians, the main problem of religion was how to affirm the possibility of human personhood in the mechanistic and deterministic world that the sciences were describing. For that purpose, what was most important about God was not the eternal relation of Son to Father but instead God's capacity to sustain human personhood and lead us toward the ethical ideal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 279) The Nineteenth Century and the Twentieth </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Century</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The strength and impressive accomplishments of the Barthian movement in theology give an impression of great discontinuity between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Powell 2001: 173–259). There is an element of truth in this; Karl Barth and, to an even greater extent, many of those influenced by him frequently lamented the general tendencies of nineteenth-century Protestant theology. They intentionally set themselves in opposition to those tendencies. At the same time, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Barth himself, whether consciously or not, was deeply influenced by important aspects of nineteenth-century theology. Most important for the doctrine of the Trinity is the extent to which Barth's theology resonates with impulses in Hegel's theology. There is, for instance, the centrality and Christocentric character of revelation in Barth's theology. This bears a close resemblance to Hegel's view of revelation. More important is the dialectical relationship between Father and Son that Barth presented in volume 4 of  <i class="calibre4">Church Dogmatics</i>, which portrays God as passing over, in the incarnation, into the negation of God, without thereby ceasing to be God. None of this suggests that Barth was a Hegelian. But Hegel's philosophy of religion provided the intellectual context in which later theologians such as Barth could discuss the Trinity in a fresh way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continuity between the nineteenth century and the twentieth is clearer with other theologians. Rudolf Bultmann, for all his criticism of the liberal theologians, essentially adopted their view of the Trinity and their reasons for deprecating it. Paul Tillich expressly reached back into the nineteenth century for his doctrine of the Trinity, creatively amalgamating the Idealist philosophies of Hegel and Friedrich Schelling. Jürgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg have frequently expressed their debt to Hegel. Although twentieth-century theology advanced considerably beyond the nineteenth century, it is also true that the twentieth century was in large measure an attempt to work out the problems that the nineteenth century identified. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article offers a sampling of what can reasonably be considered highlights of the dogmatic culture and Catholic theology of the Trinity during the nineteenth century. This analysis of nineteenth-century Catholic theology moves from the Roman scholasticism of Giovanni Perrone to the Tübingen School's emphasis on the Trinity's manifestation in history to Matthias Joseph Scheeben's creatively Augustinian approach to divine Persons and nature. It also discusses the theology of the liturgy and mystical spirituality as represented by, respectively, the Benedictine abbot Prosper Guéranger in the period's middle years and the Carmelite nun Elizabeth of Dijon at the close of the century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THIS essay offers a sampling of what can reasonably be considered highlights of the dogmatic culture of the period: specifically, the eclectic, patristically inclined, Scholasticism of the Roman school; the (Catholic) Tübingen school attuned as this was to the new German philosophy after Kant; between these, the bridging figure of the Bonn theologian Heinrich Klee, and, after them, towards the end of the nineteenth century, that theological colossus, the Rhinelander Matthias Joseph Scheeben. By way of coda, I add a brief visit to two adjacent areas, the theology of the Liturgy and mystical spirituality, as represented by, respectively, the Benedictine abbot Prosper Guéranger in the period's middle years and the Carmelite nun Elizabeth of Dijon (Elizabeth of the Trinity), at century's close. Trinitarian doctrine, after all, is not only confessed in theoretical statements, it is also celebrated doxologically and lived along the ascetical and mystical way. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> <b class="calibre3">The Roman School</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We may take as a representative figure of the Roman school Giovanni Perrone (1794–</p>
<p class="calibre1">1876), professor of dogmatic theology in the Roman College from 1824 until, with some short interruptions, his death over fifty years later. In the fourth of his nine-volume  <i class="calibre4">Praelectiones theologicae</i>, from the years 1835 to 1842 and frequently reissued, Perrone opens his treatise ‘De sanctissima Trinitate’ by declaring ‘the most august mystery of the Trinity … the basis and foundation of the entire faith. Once posited, the remaining <b class="calibre3">(p. 282) </b>mysteries of our religion subsist; once removed, the rest, equally, fall to the ground’ (Perrone 1865: 172). Misconstruals of Trinitarian believing, Perrone suggests, take three forms: failure to recognize the distinction of the persons; failure to sustain the consubstantiality and equality of the persons; failure to acknowledge the origin of the Spirit from Father and Son, as from a single principle. In order to prepare students to deal with these misunderstandings, Perrone sets out a programme of instruction. First, from the fonts proper to dogmatics, namely Scripture and Tradition, he will expound the truth of the three persons subsisting in the unity of the divine nature as a mystery which right reason in no way contradicts. Secondly, working from the same sources he will explain the two-in-one procession of the Spirit (the unusual prominence given this issue is suggestive of the continuing concern in mid-century papal Rome for reunion with ‘the Greeks’). Lastly, he will add some ‘scholia’ intended to enable readers to enhance their appreciation of this mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perrone insists that while the dogmas of the faith—where the affirmation of the triunity of God has its place—are found disclosed only in Scripture and Tradition, of which the Church is the guardian and interpreter, he does not wish to prejudge (or indeed judge) the question. Once the revelation of the triune God has taken place, can the three-in-oneness of God be demonstrated by reason? Granted the importance of this issue for the case of Anthon Günther, which played itself out during the first half of Pius IX's pontificate, it is surprising that even as late as the 31st edition Perrone is so cool on this subject, simply listing a variety of figures, from the twelfth-century Victorines Hugh and Richard to his own near-contemporary, the canon regular Tommaso Vincenzo Falletti, who thought a post-factum justification of Trinitarianism possible. The issue would be determined dogmatically in the opposite sense at the first Vatican Council five years later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perrone's commendation of a triply hypostatic but uni-essential God as the real Lord of New Testament revelation has to come to terms with the fact that nowhere in Scripture can anything like the phrase  <i class="calibre4">mia Trias</i> be discovered. But ‘what matters is the existence of the reality; once that is established, the terminology comes forth of itself’. The ‘perpetual and constant traditional sense of the Church’ confirms the evidence of Scripture for the divine Trinity as one in essence, threefold in personality. Appealing to the Tübingen school Johann Adam Möhler's  <i class="calibre4">Athanasius der Grosse</i>, Perrone distinguishes between the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘faith of the Church about the Trinity’, which is unanimous, and ‘individual explications’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">of that faith, which vary not only one from another but in their success. Moving from the historical to the dialectical mode: no rational objection can be brought against Trinitarian belief unless it can be shown (and it cannot) that unity of essence may not be combined Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> with distinct modes of existing. That the divine nature is indivisible tells us only that the persons, as modes of subsistence, are undivided. It does  <i class="calibre4">not</i> tell us that they are indistinct. Each, after all, is identical with the divine nature whereas their distinction is only in relation to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perrone investigates in turn the divinity of Son and Spirit. On the Son, ancient Arianism impugned directly the consubstantiality of the Word, modern Arianism differs from it by attacking directly only the divinity of Christ and thus indirectly that of the Word, though </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘rationalists and new theory biblicists’ may be said to amplify Arianism in  <b class="calibre3">(p. 283) </b>a fresh direction by treating the Word as merely an attribute of God, a ‘wisely operative spiritual, i.e. rational, power’, which can just as well be called the holy Spirit of God or his Wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perrone makes considerable play of the Johannine Prologue, arguing that everything said of the incarnate Word in the Fourth Gospel coheres with it, whereas, should its affirmation of the Word's distinct divine identity be removed, what the evangelist says about the personal subject of his Gospel would at once become unintelligible. Throughout his account, Perrone emphasizes that an orthodox Christology, framed within a Trinitarian narrative, can make sense of the total Gospel record in a way that ‘the system of Socinians and rationalists’ cannot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Spirit: when inspected at diverse New Testament  <i class="calibre4">loci</i> Scripture ascribes to the Spirit—understood not only as ‘power, attribute, and efficacy’ but as ‘true hypostasis or subsistent person’—both the divine name and divine ‘properties and operations’. Though care must be taken to distinguish out instances where the language of  <i class="calibre4">Pneuma</i> signifies, rather, the concrete divine nature, the third person is ‘truly and properly God’. To be sure, the liturgical prayer of the ancient Church addresses the Father, through the Son, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘in’ or ‘with’ the Spirit. This is not, however, a matter of ‘discerning grades [of divinity] </p>
<p class="calibre1">but of registering distinction of origin’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, the Spirit's procession from Father and Son: instructed by recent polemical literature of the Eastern Orthodox Perrone sets himself the twofold task of demonstrating the catholicity of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> belief, and the legitimacy of an addition to the profession of faith for a just cause. The key biblical text for the two-in-one procession of the Spirit is, to Perrone's mind, a portion of Jn 16:15, ‘all that the Father has is mine’. If all reality has its common fount in the Father, and all the Father has is the Son's, the power to spirate the third divine person will be the Son's too and not the Father's alone. As to the addition to the Creed of the clause that embodies the claim, Perrone argues that the Ephesian prohibition on ‘another [profession of] faith’ was intended to proscribe in advance any Nestorian interpolation. ‘Another’, in this context, means ‘a faith that is contrary to or different from the faith transmitted in the Nicene Symbol’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perrone's ‘scholia’ are recognizably Augustinian-Thomist in character, and as such will already be familiars to readers of this compendium. The last seeks to round off the entire treatise by indicating some grammatical indicators key to Trinitarian discourse by the way they allow one to move securely in speech, avoiding either Unitarianism or tritheism. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> <b class="calibre3">Heinrich Klee</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Klee (1800–40), generally regarded as the weightiest figure produced by the early Mainz school—self-consciously orthodox but informed about cultural and philosophical developments—taught chiefly at Bonn, though at the end of his short life he succeeded Johann Adam Möhler who had moved from Tübingen to the chair of dogmatics at Munich. The ‘de Deo uno’ of the opening volume of Klee's  <i class="calibre4">Katholische Dogmatik</i> leads into his account of God as Three by way of a protest against early modern and modern monism in the <b class="calibre3">(p. 284) </b>philosophies of Spinoza and Hegel. Whereas Spinoza's ‘realistic pantheism’ implausibly seeks to integrate incompossibles within a single Substance as attributes thereof, Hegel's ‘new intellectual pantheism’ treats God as only potentially infinite, emerging into consciousness and personality/freedom, and including within his own substance (in another version, evidently, of ‘realistic pantheism’) contradictory qualities and states—</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the rider that contradiction is sustainable if it can be rethought as the contrast between ‘aspects’ or ‘moments’ of  <i class="calibre4">Seyn</i>, ‘being’. Pantheists, comments Klee, rightly seek to move away from the ‘dead deistic Monas’ in order to win through to a ‘living God’, but their strategy of transposing into God the finite and its developments is misplaced. God's essential livingness is ‘infinite and immanent, his essential life consists indeed only in his tri-personality, the knowledge of which lifts one far above, at one and the same time, the deistic dead Monas and the finite living God of pantheists’ (Klee 1844: 101). The ‘form and ordering of [the] immanent self-positing and livingness’ of God is the Trinity, God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The principle that the inner relation of the three is the foundation of their relation  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> governs what Klee has to say about the Trinitarian outreach in creation and salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In all the works of God vis-à-vis the world, the Father determines by his plan, the Son executes that plan in the Father's name, and the Holy Spirit fulfils the Son's work in the Son's name: a formula devised by Klee on the basis of texts from the Cappadocians and St John Damascene. Klee considers the operation of the Son and the Spirit in humans to be a series of mediations. The Son mediates the union of the creature with the Father, the Spirit their union with the Son. Through the Son we enter into the being hypostatically represented in the Father, through the Spirit into the knowledge likewise represented in the Son. The Spirit is in humanity individually (the ‘little Church’) or generally (the ‘great believer’) through the grace which is God's love for us and ours for him. Filling out this picture, Klee describes the Son as (‘so to say’) ‘between’ God and the creature, the Spirit </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘within’ the creature as ‘mediating the mediation of Christ’. That is why the signature-preposition of the Son is  <i class="calibre4">dia</i>, the Spirit's  <i class="calibre4">en</i> or  <i class="calibre4">eis</i>, the Father's  <i class="calibre4">ek</i>. Here Klee seeks to formalize lexical uses found in the Pauline corpus (understood as including Hebrews). ‘As everything is from the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit, so the Father is above all, the Son through all, the Spirit in all’ (Klee 1844: 121). These outer relations mirror, as will be expected, their inner equivalents which are also their foundation, for from the Father as primordial Ground issue Son and Spirit; from the Father and through the Son the Spirit proceeds; into the Spirit the Father and the Son ‘out-mind themselves’,  <i class="calibre4">geisten sie</i> Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> <i class="calibre4">sich aus</i>, abiding in the Spirit in mutual love (Klee 1844: 122). The emphasis on mediation as a means to unity in Klee's Triadology suggests a debt to G. W. F. Hegel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Catholic Tübingen School</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Tübingen school will be represented here by its two most important figures in the perspective of Trinitarian theology: Franz Anton Staudenmaier and Johann Evangelist Kuhn. Although Klee's dogmatics furnish some evidence of a conceptual conversation <b class="calibre3">(p. 285) </b>with post-Kantian philosophy in Germany (which means, above all, F. W. J. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schelling, as well as Hegel), he shares a fundamentally Scholastic structure of thinking with Perrone and the Roman school. What such writers as Staudenmaier and Kuhn add is a far more thoroughgoing presentation of the Trinity as manifested in history, for which they draw on not only the enhanced sensibility of Romanticism for past epochs but also the philosophical conviction of the Real-Idealists that the historical process is itself a revelation of the Absolute: the meaning of history is to be identified as the history of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The upshot, predictably enough, is a theology of salvation history the content of which has been speculatively rethought. What emerges, however, from the Catholic Tübingen writers, by contrast with the German philosophers, is a vision of history where, as in a covenant dialogue, divine hypostases are disclosed  <i class="calibre4">for the sake of personal union</i> with their human images. Furthermore, there is a conviction that, in the disclosure of the Trinitarian names, history yields up its own infinite ground, the Triune God  <i class="calibre4">as he is in and</i> <i class="calibre4">for himself</i>, beyond the horizon of any creature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franz Anton Staudenmaier (1800–56) had his intellectual formation at Tübingen but taught elsewhere: at Giessen and (especially) Freiburg. The twin volumes of his  <i class="calibre4">Encyklopädie</i>, giving his account of the overall shape of Christian theology, were published at Mainz in 1834, and his four-volume dogmatics, which has as subject the content of Catholic Christianity, at Freiburg between 1844 and 1852. In the  <i class="calibre4">Encyklopädie</i> he treats the history of divine revelation before his account of the one God, in accordance with the basic notion of the work that theology is a science which represents and develops knowledge  <i class="calibre4">from</i> God, raising ‘God-consciousness’,  <i class="calibre4">Gottesbewusstsein</i>, to scientific form (Staudenmaier 1840: vol. 2, 26). It is in history that God has unveiled himself, rendering objective thereby the highest ideas of his being. He appears there as a twofold: relation to himself and relation to the religious existence of the human family. More specifically, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have revealed themselves through their work of founding in humanity the Kingdom of God—an ‘outer economy’ which itself discloses the ‘inner economy’ of their own divine life. The revelation of that triune work and its origin enters our consciousness as the distinctively Christian knowledge of the ‘creation, redemption, and sanctification of the world’ (Staudenmaier 1840: vol. 1, 516). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  <i class="calibre4">Die christliche Dogmatik</i>, Staudenmaier adopts the more chronologically apt order of a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘de Deo uno’ followed by an account of the divine tri-personality which has entered the noetic realm of the Church through a phased historical manifestation. By means of historical events the Holy Trinity calls man with a view to reshaping his personal existence by Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> reference to the Kingdom, the centrality of which in Tübingen school thinking was established from its inception by the school's effective founder, Johann Sebastian Drey. Staudenmaier insists on the immanent character of God's fullness of life in the eternal love-exchange: the ‘inner movement’ of the processions is the true dialectic—far removed from the ‘dialectic of the logical Idea, thoroughly hypostatized in our time, to be sure’ but increasingly reduced to a ‘sheer dialectical game’ (Staudenmaier 1844: 567). His is an objective transcendentalism that treats God's triune nature as the primary presupposition of a gratuitous creation. At the same time, Staudenmaier's thought also exemplifies an historical personalism. His conviction that in God personhood exists in  <b class="calibre3">(p. 286) </b>self-surrender to another fuelled his opposition to Günther's attempt to demonstrate divine Triunity from the analysis of infinite self-consciousness, while his anthropology is structured by a cognate conviction: God's tri-personal being in, through, and for another has its created mirror in man as the image of God. This is the final topic of his ‘de Deo trino’, serving to link the treatise to the account of creation which will follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johann Evangelist Kuhn (1806–87) bears comparison with Perrone for academic stability and longevity, since he held the chair of dogma at Tübingen from 1837 to 1882. His unfinished  <i class="calibre4">Katholische Dogmatik</i>, dating from the 1840s and 50s, deals only with God, as One and Three, though a further volume, dealing with creation and grace, appeared in the following decade. The hallmark of his theological work has been defined as  <i class="calibre4">unterscheidende</i> <i class="calibre4">Zuordnung</i>, the ‘distinguishing out’ of levels through the exhibition of the ‘ordering of one to another’ (Courth 1996: 82). ‘Rational faith’,  <i class="calibre4">Vernunftsglaube</i>, by which philosophy has confidence to entertain truth universally, is, so Kuhn explained in essays on fundamental theology propaedeutic to his dogmatics, distinct from but ordered to revelational faith—that faith by which Christian truth is accessed in the saving history attested in Old and New Testaments and unfolded in the life of the Church. Idealist a-priorism, which pre-empts history and nature in their givenness, renders this ordering impossible. In the saving-historical events, the Absolute discloses itself through the medium of the relative, and thus by way, precisely, of natural, historical reality. Resisting disclosure of this sort inhibits access to the truth of Christianity in its transcendence of all purely human question-setting and thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that history which is Christianity's basic character and primordial element, the key event is the Incarnation of the Word, itself anchored in Israel's story. As Kuhn remarks in <i class="calibre4">Katholische Dogmatik</i>, since the divinity of Christ is the guarantee of supernatural truth's accessibility, it has to be the  ‘decisive question of the doctrine of the Trinity’ (Kuhn 1857: 57). The temporally displayed sonship of Christ is the correlate of his eternal sonship as Logos, so the history of Jesus—his life, death, and resurrection—has irreplaceable significance. It is a history which presents to us the being of the triune God, revealed not only for our knowledge but also for our intimate sharing in a union of life, itself exhibited in the communion of the Church as Bride of Christ, sustained by the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Kuhn, just as, in philosophy, a condition of truth's validity is its universality, so in theology a condition of this truth's validity is its recognition by the catholic (universal) mind of the Church. The crucial role of confession of the Trinity in the developmental exfolia</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> tion of doctrine shows how this dogma is central not only to the subjective dialectic of the Church's consciousness but also to the objective dialectic of the Christian system. It is, in yet another challenge to Hegelianism, the key universal and objective speculative concept. Kuhn's attempt at a  ‘scientific mediation of dogma’ moves through a consideration of the ‘thinkability’,  <i class="calibre4">Denkbarkeit</i>, and, subsequently, ‘knowability’,  <i class="calibre4">Erkennbarkeit</i>, of the Trinity to ‘analogical and speculative clarifications’ of this, the Church's most fundamental confession of faith. Trinitarianism is ‘concrete’, over against ‘abstract’, monotheism, deepening and enriching theism by its revelation of God as ‘the absolutely personal’, for God's life is person-forming while in the same moment unconditionally fulfilling its own unity of essence (Kuhn 1857: 588). The Trinity is  <b class="calibre3">(p. 287) </b>objective love in its own dispossessing self-possession: the Father who knows himself in the Son spirating their mutual love as the Holy Ghost. In this way, for Kuhn, the Holy Trinity serves as the model for human personality whose vocation is the overcoming of egoism in moral union with others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, as with Staudenmaier, this anthropological corollary permits a transition to a theology of the created realm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Scheeben</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Matthias Joseph Scheeben (1835–88), formed in the Roman school, was well instructed on the German theology of his period, his own working life being spent entirely in the seminary of the archdiocese of Cologne. Though Scheeben has been described as a ‘Hegel of Catholic theology’ for the way in which, like Hegel, he has a universal system for the mediation of the Absolute, the comparison is limited to the formal consideration of the overall scheme. Materially, or content-wise, no two writers could be more different. The fruitfulness of the triune divine life is in Scheeben's thought the superordinate category integrating all abstract particularity into a single totality: Scheeben's riposte to Hegelianism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the second volume of his (1873–87)  <i class="calibre4">Handbuch der katholischen Dogmatik</i>, the place to look for his views on the historical emergence of Trinitarian thought, Scheeben shows high respect not only for the dialectical skills of the Greek Fathers in handling concepts pertinent to the Trinitarian relations of origin but also for the repertoire of sensuous images by which they sought to persuade their interlocutors of the truth of the orthodox doctrine: the Root, the Flower, the Perfume; the Spring, the Source, the River; the Light, the Radiance, the Beam, and so forth. That is not to say there is any disprizing of their Latin opposite numbers. Quite apart from the fundamentally Augustinian caste of his theology of the processions of the second and third persons as ‘Word’ and ‘Love’ respectively, Scheeben regards the typically western pneumatology for which the Holy Spirit is </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘bond and pledge of the mutual love’ of Father and Son as complementing the Greek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scheeben proposed to integrate one with another the western (above all, Augustinian) and eastern (above all, Cappadocian) doctrines of the Holy Spirit as the ‘communion’ or </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘bond’ of Father and Son, in the first case, and, in the second, the ‘complement and conclusive seal’, the ‘culmination and flower’, of the divine Trinity. It is precisely ‘as unitive bond’ that the Spirit  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the ‘sealing’ of the unity of Father and Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> In his rich account of the Holy Trinity in the 1865  <i class="calibre4">Mysterien des Christentums</i>, Scheeben characteristically describes this mystery as combining obscurity with intelligibility. On </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘obscurity’: the dogma proposed to us by the Church posits not the demonstrability of Trinitarian doctrine but its opposite:  <i class="calibre4">in</i> demonstrability. From what is not God, that is, from reflecting on the created world, there can be demonstrated, philosophically, the unity of the divine nature but hardly the distinction between the divine persons. Only the divine persons can know themselves in their mutual distinction and their mutual relations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To ascertain that God's knowledge and will issue in a product  <b class="calibre3">(p. 288) </b>  <i class="calibre4">distinct from himself as Father</i> is beyond human capability. Attempts to construct the doctrine of the Trinity from the divine self-consciousness, whether these be medieval, as with Anselm in the <i class="calibre4">Monologion</i>, or modern as with Günther, cannot deliver the goods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[N]othing can be inferred from a consideration of the divine nature except what belongs to its constitution or unfolding. The persons, however, do not constitute the nature but possess it; and the production of the persons is no unfolding of the divine nature, which in any case is not capable of any real evolution, but is a communication of the complete, perfect, simple nature to distinct subjects. (Scheeben 1946: 36–7)</p>
<p class="calibre1">From within the resources of reason we simply do not know whether such a communication of nature to distinct subjects—but without multiplication of that nature—is admissible in God. We cannot be sure of our ground in saying it entails neither contradiction nor imperfection for him. Once, however, we accept through faith the existence of the Trinity, arguments like those of Anselm, Bonaventure, Richard, enable us to see how in this revealed truth the divine power, goodness, and beatitude is incomparably displayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scheeben adds that aesthetic admiration for the beauty of Trinitarian doctrine could well be a motive which would lead an unbeliever to consider the claims of revelation for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason for the inconceivability of this mystery is its supernaturality, which is the true ground of its suprarationality. Whereas the principle of causality, arguing from effects in the world to their source in God, gives access to a representation of the divine nature which, if not adequate, is nonetheless, when our concepts have been rationally purified for the purpose, valid so far as it goes, by contrast, God as Trinity, in relation to whom that principle necessarily falls short, enjoys an inconceivability to reason which goes far beyond that of God as God. However, as Scheeben points out, just because something is not ‘absolutely conceivable’ is not to say it is ‘absolutely inconceivable’: hence the intelligibility or ‘light-side’ of Trinitarian belief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scheeben's method in his dogmatics is by choice a progressive, synthetic method, starting from what he considers the ‘root principle in the Trinity’: the productiveness of the divine knowledge as the Word, and the productiveness of divine love as the Holy Spirit, even if he also admits the liceity of a regressive, analytic method, where one moves from the Trinity of persons, through the distinctions and relations in God, to the ‘processions, the productions, and the communications’ that take place in him. While one can begin to Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> explore Trinitarian doctrine from any point whatsoever within its basic structure (that must be so, if the various interrelated doctrinal theses that make up Trinitarianism are fully coherent), not every point is as good to begin from as every other. Indeed, he claims there is only one point from which to survey the whole ‘in correct alignment’. Thomas Aquinas appraised this rightly when in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> he built up his version of Trinitarian doctrine from the productions and processions, only on that basis going on subsequently to treat of the relations and then the persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The genetic starting-point or root-principle for Scheeben's Trinitarian doctrine is plain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While reason already tells us that divine substance is sheer being and so sheer activity, and likewise that this activity of God is the perfect knowledge and love of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 289) </b>himself, faith enters the picture—by way of the Church's teaching on the basis of Scripture and Tradition—to reveal that the activity of the divine life is  <i class="calibre4">also personally productive</i>. Contrasting his own approach with the Thomasian one, Scheeben believes he can show the personal character of the inner products of divine knowledge and love not only ‘more easily’ but also more ‘clearly and understandably’. In his short cut to the tri-personality of God, Scheeben first defines a person as a subsistent bearer of a nature who is endowed with ‘proprietorship’ over that nature—namely, the aptitude for conscious enjoyment of the powers of that nature, and for free dominion over them. Persons are the noble owners of all they have and are. Scheeben argues that the internal divine productions issue in </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘bearers and proprietors of the divine nature’ which can only be persons in mode. In the case of God, the issue or outcome of divine productivity ‘cannot be regarded as something contributing to the perfection, actuation, completion of the producing subject … </p>
<p class="calibre1">[since] otherwise the producing subject would not be pure and perfect actuality’. Once we have excluded this option, all that remains is that ‘the producing subject, operating out of the fullness of his actuality, communicates his own perfection to another subject, and places another subject in the co-possession of his own perfection’ (Scheeben 1946: 73–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The upshot of Scheeben's account of the immanent Trinity is that the divine persons are relative proprietors of the divine nature; that is, they are proprietors of the nature in and through their relationship to other proprietors of the same nature. Indeed, if the persons did not remain essentially relative among themselves, then ‘they could not all be absolute; for they would have to be distinguished from one another by something else than the sole mode of possession’ (Scheeben 1946: 82). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scheeben's account of the economic Trinity considers the missions of the Son and the Spirit in close connection with their eternal processions, themselves rooted in the divine </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘productions’, the fecundity of knowledge and love in God. In contrast to the writers of the Catholic Tübingen school who characteristically put forward at an early opportunity and with maximum concreteness the topic of divine action in salvation history, Scheeben postpones his account of the Incarnation and the Pentecost economy of the Spirit. Like Aquinas in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i>, he wants to put in place first an account of the general ontological structure of the gracious relation between the Trinity and man. Only subsequently does he deal with the historical mode, in which by mercy shown to fallen humanity, Father, Son, and Spirit filled this structure with its content on the basis of the work of Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> Jesus Christ in a particular stretch of time, on a particular part of the surface of planet Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Scheeben's theology of the processions, only the second person proceeds by way of being the expression—the Word or the Image—of the Father's knowledge of himself. By contrast, the third person proceeds from the first in conjunction with the second not as the expression of the Father but as, rather, the outpouring of the mutual love of Father and Son. ‘Spirit’ is a synonym for  <i class="calibre4">aspiration</i>, the ‘sigh of love’. But ‘sigh of love’ or ‘sigh of the heart’ can indicate the procession of a divine person only if we perceive in it ‘a real outpouring of the divine substance and life’. If etymologically a ‘procession’ means a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 290)</b> movement, then procession is well exemplified in spiration: the movement of the ‘torrent of love’ of Father and Son poured into the divine Third. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The missions are continuations of the processions, so understood. But granted his resolve to postpone his account of the Incarnation until he has dealt with creation and Fall, Scheeben is obliged to confine himself to an account of the enlightening and enlivening activity of Son and Spirit as faith and charity are brought about in justification and sanctification, and there follows on those redemptive acts the indwelling in the soul of the produced persons, the Son and the Spirit, and through them the indwelling of their producer, the Father. ‘[B]y their common activity and mode of action the divine persons externally prolong and continue, or imitate and reproduce their internal relations, and thereby call into being an order of things which is an objective unfolding and revelation, of the inner heart of this mystery, and which can be thoroughly understood and perfectly grasped only in the light of this mystery’ (Scheeben 1946: 136). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the context of the divine plan to deify human creatures: that is, to communicate to them by grace—therefore, essentially as gift—a share in the divine nature, the Son is the exemplar and motive for our adoptive filiation, sent into us as the  <i class="calibre4">means</i> of this adoptive sonship of ours—though to appreciate those means adequately we cannot prescind from the mission of the third person, the Holy Spirit. The Son can come to dwell in us in a manner exceeding mere divine omnipresence by means of an effect which reproduces his own hypostatic distinctiveness as the Father's Image and Word. That effect for Scheeben comes about in the act of Christian faith, when the Son of God marks us with an ‘impress’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">of himself, bringing about in us an ‘expression’ of himself. That is possible because when, in the act of faith, supernatural light is communicated to our minds, imparting to us a reflection of the divine nature, the Son reproduces in us a likeness of his own procession as the Father's radiant Image. Thus through faith the Father's consubstantial Word is born in us by an ‘imitation and extension’ of his eternal production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our adoption as God's children is ‘rooted in the procession of the Holy Spirit’ (especially emphasized in Scheeben's theology of grace: the real ground of the higher dignity of the engraced is the indwelling Spirit as substantial complement to the accidental ‘grace that sanctifies and makes gracious’), precisely because it is rooted in the Son's procession from the Father and relation to the Father, for the Word does not come from the Father <i class="calibre4">except as</i> breathing forth the Father's love in the spiration of the Spirit. Likewise, the Son Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> cannot be born in us by faith unless at the same time there is an ‘application to the creature of the divine love-flame, flaring up in the Holy Spirit by the enkindling of a similar flame’ (Scheeben 1946: 157), in the charity, namely, without which, for the apostle James, faith is dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The upshot of this interrelated ‘impression and expression’ of Son and Spirit on us in faith and charity—the supernatural acts of knowledge and love belonging with grace—is that those persons are in us to be vitally and intimately  <i class="calibre4">possessed and enjoyed</i>.  ‘Possession’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">and ‘enjoyment’ are Scheeben's key terms for the life with God which follows on the missions of the Son and the Spirit, which missions bring with them—also to be possessed and enjoyed—the presence of the Father. This brings me in conclusion to two areas of lived theology: worship and spirituality. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 291) Guéranger</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Prosper Louis Pascal Guéranger (1800–75), ordained priest in 1827, revived the Benedictine life in France by restoring in 1832–33 the pre-Revolutionary priory of Solesmes of which in 1837 he was appointed the first abbot by Pope Gregory XVI and where he remained for the rest of his life. He published his commentary on the Church year,  <i class="calibre4">L’Année</i> <i class="calibre4">liturgique</i>, in nine volumes between 1841 and 1866. It soon established itself as a classic of liturgically oriented reflection. In the sections of his commentary which deal with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Time after Pentecost’, Guéranger begins his comments on the texts of the Roman rite Mass and Office of Trinity Sunday by an affirmation of the sacred Liturgy's Trinity-centredness. ‘Every homage paid to God by the Church's liturgy has the Holy Trinity as its object. Time, as well as eternity, belongs to the Trinity. The Trinity is the scope of all religion. Every day, every hour, belongs to It. The feasts instituted in memory of the mysteries of our redemption centre in It’ (Guéranger 2000: 90). In teaching us that he and the Father are one ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 17:22), the Son made known their unity of essence in distinction of persons, while by sending, with the Father, the Holy Spirit as the ‘new Gift’, he communicated the ‘eternal link of the first two’. In these ‘three eternal Terms of His uncreated Substance’ is ‘the Act, pure and infinite’. If the introduction of the language of  <i class="calibre4">actus purus</i> shows Guéranger's debt to Thomas's metaphysics, his more characteristic emphasis is on the way the Liturgy constitutes, in the unfolding Church year, a mimesis of the Trinitarian revelation, the graciousness of whose developing episodic structure is opened again for human beings each time the sequence of seasons and feasts is played out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a process Guéranger links to the economy of the Son in so far as it is  <i class="calibre4">illuminative</i>, where ‘the soul gains continually more and more of the light of the Incarnate Word, who, by His examples and teachings, renovates each one of her faculties, and imparts to her the habit of seeing all things from God's point of view’, and to that of the Holy Spirit in so far as it is  <i class="calibre4">unitive</i>, for the Spirit ‘has been sent into this world that He may maintain each one of our souls in the possession of Christ, and may bring to perfection the love whereby the creature is united with its God’ (Guéranger 2000: 8–9). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a><b class="calibre3">Catholic Theology of the Trinity in the Nineteenth Century</b> <b class="calibre3">Elizabeth of Dijon</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Élisabeth Catez (1880–1906), the daughter of an army officer who two years after her birth settled in the Burgundian town of Dijon, entered the Carmelite monastery there in 1901, abandoning thereby a promising musical career. She was given the ‘title of devotion’ Elizabeth ‘of the Trinity’, and, in the course of what remained of her brief life, mystical charisms to match it. Not that their communication had altogether awaited her consecration as a Carmelite nun. In a poem of 1898 addressed to the Holy Spirit she had <b class="calibre3">(p. 292) </b>asked the third divine person to ‘consume with your divine flames/ this body and this heart and this soul,/ this spouse of the Trinity who desires only your will’ (Elizabeth of the Trinity 1984: 17). But a charism rooted, no doubt, in the gifts of the Spirit bestowed at Confirmation expanded wonderfully in the context of monastic life. She underlines the merciful kindness of the Trinitarian economy in which the God who is ‘all love’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">continually bends over his human work, seeking its deification. As she wrote in August 1905 to her sister, a married woman and mother: thanks to the Trinitarian indwelling the centre of the soul is the ‘house of the Father’:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You can withdraw to this solitude to surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit so He can transform you in God and imprint on your soul the image of the divine Beauty, so the Father, bending over you lovingly, will see only His Christ and say: ‘This is my beloved daughter, in whom I am well pleased’. (Elizabeth of the Trinity 1995: 215)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her doctrine is best summed up in the widely circulated prayer,  <i class="calibre4">O mon Dieu, Trinité que</i> <i class="calibre4">j’adore</i>, dated 21 November (the feast of the Virgin's Presentation in the Temple) 1904, and included as an appendix to the spiritual biography she wrote when she was dying, at the behest of the prioress of her Carmel (Elizabeth of the Trinity 1984: 183–4). Having addressed the triune Lord globally (‘O my Changeless One’) from a posture she describes as </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘all adoring’ but at the same time ‘completely given over to your creative action’, she salutes the persons by turn, following the order Son, Spirit, Father. Elizabeth begins the Christological section of the prayer with an appeal to Christ as ‘crucified by love’, before deepening her approach to his hypostasis with a shift of address to him as ‘eternal Word, Speech of my God’. Her request is that ‘through all the nights, all the emptiness, all the powerlessness’, she might ‘remain under your great light’. Her apostrophe of the Spirit asks for an analogous reproduction in her soul of what he did at the Word's Incarnation, that she might become ‘another humanity’ in which the Son can ‘reveal his mystery’. Her address to the Father is couched in the same terms as the letter to her sister quoted above, and leads into the prayer's conclusion where she turns to ‘my Three, my All’, and in daring imagery, invites the Trinity to ‘bury yourself in me so that I may bury myself in you’. The prayer, which has been the subject of substantial commentaries, corresponds to the testament she left her prioress, bequeathing ‘this vocation which was mine in the heart of the Church Militant and which from now on I will unceasingly fulfill in the Church Triumphant, “the Praise of Glory of the Holy Trinity” ’ (Elizabeth of the Trinity 1984: 180). </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines Karl Barth's doctrine of the Trinity and some other Protestant doctrines after him. It credits Barth with placing the revelation of the Trinity at the foundation of his dogmatics and with insisting that God's attributes (in his unity) be thought through only in relation to prior Trinitarian and soteriological reflection. It also analyzes the thoughts and works of Jürgen Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, and Eberhard Jüngel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Karl Barth, Trinity, Protestant doctrines, dogmatics, God's attributes, soteriological reflection, Jürgen Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Eberhard Jüngel</p>
<p class="calibre1">PRIOR to Karl Barth the doctrine of the Trinity had played a minor role in modern Protestant theology. The tone was set in the eighteenth century by Immanuel Kant, who stated that Trinitarian doctrine offered ‘absolutely nothing worthwhile’ for practical life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich Schleiermacher, in turn, would relegate the doctrine to what was essentially an appendix, because he could find nothing in it of ‘constitutive significance’ for the consciousness of God. All this dramatically changed after Barth. By front-loading the doctrine, jarringly, at the very outset of his dogmatics, he not only managed to reorient Protestant theology back toward the great catholic tradition. At the same time, he also sparked a major revival of interest in the ancient doctrine itself, one that surged in the second half of the twentieth century and that shows no signs of abating to this day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth's own treatment of the doctrine was characteristically subtle, deep, and idiosyncratic. It has not always been well understood. Synthetic attempts to summarize his views invariably tend to miss a great deal. Perhaps the best procedure would be to unpack his account by following the order in which he presents it ( <i class="calibre4">Church Dogmatics</i>, vol. I/1, 295–</p>
<p class="calibre1">489). His later use and development of the doctrine did not depart from these basic outlines. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Doctrine of the Trinity in Dogmatics (I/1: 295–</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">304)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth was well aware that the doctrine of the Trinity had rarely been accorded the prominence he allotted to it. ‘In putting the doctrine of the Trinity at the head of all dogmatics we are adopting a very isolated position from the standpoint of dogmatic history’ (I/1: 300). By way of precedent he could unearth only Lombard and Bonaventure. He considered it strange that Christian theology should so often have begun by developing a principle of knowledge ( <i class="calibre4">principium cognoscendi</i>) divorced from the triune God as the actual content of faith. This approach could only mean that ‘God's existence, nature and attributes’ were dealt with ‘apart from the concrete givenness of what Christians call “God” ’ (I/1: 300). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth proposed the following axiom: ‘The doctrine of the Trinity is what basically distinguishes the Christian doctrine of God as Christian, and therefore what already distinguishes the Christian concept of revelation as Christian, in contrast to all other possible doctrines of God or concepts of revelation’ (I/1: 301). This proposition, which yoked the Trinity with revelation, would be of seminal importance for everything Barth went on to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How was the doctrine of the Trinity related to the concept of revelation? Barth's answer was deceptively simple. Many interpreters have been misled by it. They have assumed that he intended to derive his doctrine of the Trinity from his idea of revelation. Although not entirely wrong, this assumption misses the central point. It must be admitted, however, that Barth could have been clearer about what he was trying to accomplish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take, for example, the centrepiece of his opening section: ‘ <i class="calibre4">God</i> reveals himself. He  <i class="calibre4">reveals</i> himself through himself. He reveals  <i class="calibre4">himself</i> ’ (I/1: 296). One and the same God reiterated himself in a threefold way as the Revealer, the act of revelation (objectively), and the perpetual impartation of that revelation (subjectively). The point of these formulations was not primarily that the doctrine of the Trinity derives from revelation. The point was rather that revelation has a Trinitarian structure. The first statement alluded to the Father, the second to the Son, and the third to the Holy Spirit. Barth was unpacking the idea that the Father reveals himself through the Son and in the Spirit. Apart from his act of revelation, God would remain hidden to us. But the hidden God who reveals himself is none other than the triune God. The acting Subject in the event of revelation is the Holy Trinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth was not attempting to derive the dogma of the Trinity from these observations. The force of his argument was not so much epistemological as logical or analytical. He was not trying to explain how the dogma of the Trinity is acquired. He was presupposing the dogma and using it to interpret revelation. Of course he also believed that it is only <b class="calibre3">(p. 296) </b>through revelation that the dogma arises. Nevertheless, the question of derivation was secondary to his concerns. He was not deriving the dogma, but explaining revelation by making explicit its Trinitarian grammar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A weakness in Barth's presentation may be mentioned at this point. When discussing the doctrine of the Trinity, he never paid sufficient attention (arguably) to the question of derivation. Had he done so, he would have been required to place more emphasis on at least two other matters, namely, reconciliation and worship. The doctrine of the Trinity arises for the Church, because it confesses the full deity of Jesus Christ. Along with its biblical attestation, the mystery of Christ's deity is indispensable to the doctrines of revelation, reconciliation, and worship. Barth's relative neglect of reconciliation and worship in this context, alongside his heavy emphasis on revelation, left his Trinitarian doctrine with a certain imbalance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God in His Revelation: The Root of the Doctrine of the Trinity (I/1: 304–33)</b> Barth was not only presupposing the dogma of the Trinity, he was also testing and confirming it. Was it just a hoary museum piece from the past, as much modern theology had presupposed, or was it essential to the faith of the Church? Despite the objection that the dogma as such could not be found in the Bible, Barth wanted to show that it was materially valid and legitimate—that it was a good interpretation of the Bible (I/1: 310). His strategy for demonstrating this point was both biblical and theological. Along with several lengthy and ingenious excurses of biblical exegesis, he turned again, theologically, to the concept of revelation. ‘The basis or root of the doctrine of the Trinity, if it has one and is thus legitimate dogma—and it does have one and is thus legitimate dogma—lies in revelation’ (I/1: 311). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The question of legitimacy, as Barth tackled it, was, once again, more nearly logical than epistemological. Analysis would show that the dogma of the Trinity was rooted in revelation, because revelation could not be understood apart from it. Although it was the Trinity's epistemological source, revelation was here set forth from the standpoint of being its conceptual basis. (The word ‘root’, by the way, was misleading in so far as it pointed interpreters in an epistemological direction. ‘Root’ as used by Barth in this context meant primarily ‘logical or conceptual basis’.) Revelation presupposed the doctrine of the Trinity, even as the Trinity interpreted the concept of revelation. Barth's argument was essentially coherentist. It made a case that the doctrine of the Trinity was logically necessary to the concept of revelation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth presented the doctrine as ‘an interpretation of revelation’ (I/1: 312). ‘We arrive at the doctrine of the Trinity by no other way than that of  <i class="calibre4">an analysis of the concept of revelation</i>. Conversely, if revelation is to be interpreted aright, it must be interpreted as the <i class="calibre4">basis</i> of the doctrine of the Trinity’ (I/1: 312, italics added). The doctrine and the concept, <b class="calibre3">(p. 297) </b>Trinity and revelation, were mutually implicated in one another but were not to be seen as identical. Revelation was not to be ‘confused or equated’ with the doctrine of the Trinity (I/1: 310), nor could the doctrine be seen as an ‘exhaustive interpretation’ of the concept (I/1: 312). Barth was offering a Trinitarian interpretation of revelation, not a revelational doctrine of the Trinity. In conclusion Barth stated: We have been asking about the root of the doctrine of the Trinity, its root in revelation, not in any revelation, not in a general concept of revelation, but in  <i class="calibre4">the concept of revelation</i> taken from the Bible. We have been asking whether revelation must be understood as the  <i class="calibre4">ground</i> of the doctrine of the Trinity, whether the doctrine of the Trinity must be understood as having grown out of this soil. (I/1: 332, italics added)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth had subjected the idea of revelation to a detailed conceptual analysis. He had found that the biblical witness to revelation, when examined from several different standpoints, regularly involved three elements, which always ‘say the same thing three times in three indissolubly different ways’ (I/1: 332). Various triadic formulae were set forth: ‘unveiling, veiling and impartation’, or ‘form, freedom and historicity’, or ‘Easter, Good Friday and Pentecost’ (I/1: 332). From each standpoint, God was God three times as the objective act of Revelation, the Revealer, and the subjective imparter of Revelation (‘Son, Father and Spirit’). As these varied triads confirm, Barth had been asking primarily about a conceptual basis for the doctrine as opposed to its epistemological source. As he would go on to note, the doctrine of the Trinity ‘has not yet encountered us directly’ (I/1: 333). That would come later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Barth had established so far was that, from a logical point of view, assertions of Trinitarian doctrine ought to be regarded as ‘indirectly, though not directly, identical with those of the biblical witness to revelation’ (I/1: 333). Therefore, the doctrine of the Trinity</p>
<p class="calibre1">—being rooted, deeply and inextricably, in revelation—could not be dismissed as ‘a non-Church construct, i.e. one which was not necessary as such in the Church, one which did not arise in its day on the basis of Scripture—of the faith in God's revelation to which Scripture gave rise—a doctrine dealing merely with a theme of pagan antiquity’ (I/1: 333 </p>
<p class="calibre1">rev.). That was the point Barth had set out to prove on dogmatic theological grounds when he asked about the ‘root’ of the doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God in His Revelation:</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Vestigium Trinitatis</b></i> <b class="calibre3">(I/1:</b> <b class="calibre3">333–47)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The preceding discussion turned on distinguishing between a source of knowledge and a logical or conceptual basis. It was suggested that Barth's metaphor about ‘the root of the doctrine’ had more to do with the latter than the former. At the same time, however, care was taken not to rule out the idea that ‘root’ could also mean ‘source of knowledge’, even though that meaning seemed to be secondary. If so, then a shift now needs to be noted. In discussing ‘Vestiges of the Trinity’, the ‘root’ metaphor is employed to mean  <b class="calibre3">(p. 298) </b>origin or source, not logical basis. If Barth moved between these two different meanings, as he seems to have done, he may not have been fully aware of it, nor did he clearly signal it to his readers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth's point in the new section is relatively simple. The doctrine of the Trinity, he argued, has only one source, not two. Not even if the two sources were ranked as superior and inferior or as primary and secondary could a second source be permitted. The mystery of the Trinity was unique, and its source of knowledge in revelation was likewise unique. Despite any superficial similarities, the Trinity stood beyond all analogies with anything in the created realm. Apart from God's revelation in Christ, nothing in the created order could function as a source or basis by which God's triune identity could be known. No line of continuity could be traced from any triadic features of worldly phenomena to the transcendent mystery of the Trinity. Therefore, no worldly features could function as a secondary source for knowledge of the triune God, and even illustrations were considered dubious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth stated his point with some precision. There was no ‘essential trinitarian disposition supposedly immanent in some creaturely realities’, he argued, ‘quite apart from their possible conscription by God's revelation’ (I/1: 334). That would require an  <i class="calibre4">analogia entis</i>, whereby traces of the Trinity would be found in ‘being as such’ (I/1: 334). We would therefore need to assume ‘a second root’ for the doctrine of the Trinity (I/1: 335). Quite apart from biblical revelation, or alongside it, these worldly traces would function as a root or ground from which to develop the Trinitarian dogma. It would then have to be asked, which of the two roots is primary and which secondary? Does the biblical doctrine simply confirm or supplement a knowledge of God that could be gained apart from biblical revelation? If the Trinity were somehow grounded in natural revelation alongside and independently of biblical revelation, then the worldly reality could easily overtake the transcendent reality, so that Trinitarian ideas would finally be a determination of human existence in the world, and thus we would be back, Barth argued, in the realm of myth. It would be a matter of anthropology and cosmology but not theology (I/1: 335). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth dealt with the question of theological knowledge through the Reformation doctrine of grace alone. Grace and grace alone made possible what was otherwise impossible, not only with respect to salvation, but also with respect to knowledge of God. Although God's radical transcendence of all things creaturely had been exacerbated by the abyss of sin, it Page 5 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">was not sin and the fall but creation that Barth had in view when asking about ‘vestiges of the Trinity’. The condition for the possibility of knowing and speaking about God, he argued, resided solely in grace, not in any creaturely realities. When those realities were conscripted by grace, despite their radical incapacity, it could only be explained as a miraculous event grounded in God's transcendent freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In principle, therefore, language about God could not be ‘fatally reversed’ (I/1: 334). It could not be changed into language about the creature, though in practice that danger would always loom (I/1: 344–6). ‘We can only try to point to the fact that the root of the doctrine of the Trinity lies in revelation, and that it can lie only in this if it is not to become at once the doctrine of another and alien god’ (I/1: 346). It was always a matter of <b class="calibre3">(p. 299) </b>letting revelation ‘speak for itself’ (I/1: 347). In adhering to this principle, Barth reasoned, ‘we shall not be accepting a second root alongside the first, but just the one root of the doctrine of the Trinity’ (I/1: 347). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Triunity of God: Unity in Trinity (I/1: 348–</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">53)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The word ‘unity’ as given in the translation is potentially misleading here. ‘Unity’ can carry the connotation that otherwise diverse elements have been ‘unified’ or brought into harmony. However, although sharing the same possible connotation, the German word <i class="calibre4">Einheit</i> might more literally be translated as ‘oneness’. It is God's oneness that Barth had in view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God is one, for Barth, in three different senses: personal, ontological, and dominical. In the personal sense God is one as a single acting Subject. The God of the biblical witness, he urged, is always ‘indissolubly Subject’ (I/1: 348). As the divine Thou, this personal, living God encounters the human subject as an I in order to establish with it a relationship of communion or fellowship (I/1: 348). God's oneness as a personal acting Subject is always presupposed by God's threeness and expressed in it. There is no divine threeness without this oneness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In and with being ‘irreducibly personal’ (I/1: 351), God's oneness is also ontological. ‘It is’, wrote Barth, ‘as well to note at this early stage that what we today call the “personality” of God belongs to the one unique essence of God which the doctrine of the Trinity does not seek to triple but rather to recognise in its simplicity’ (I/1: 350). The notion of divine simplicity is underscored by quoting from the seventeenth-century  <i class="calibre4">Leiden Synopsis</i>: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Now the essence of God is absolutely one, undivided and singular, and so to this extent our idea of the three persons cannot in any way be said to be that they are separate individuals’ (I/1: 350). God's essence or  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>, for Barth (as for the mainstream tradition), is ontologically simple and indivisible. God's oneness is simple as well as personal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, God's oneness is the oneness of the Lord. His essence is identical with his sovereignty and freedom. ‘The essence of God is the being of God as divine being. The essence Page 6 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">of God is the Godhead of God’ (I/1: 349). From the biblical standpoint, it is God's essence that makes him what he is, namely, ‘the One He describes Himself to be by this name </p>
<p class="calibre1">[ <i class="calibre4">Yahweh</i>], the name of the Lord’ (I/1: 349). To say that God's essence is his Lordship means that his essence is personal, sovereign, and free. Modern naturalism and pantheism treat God as though God's essence were impersonal, or personal only metaphorically in human experience (I/1: 351, 358). Finally, in a way that remains to be explained more fully, God's oneness ‘consists in’ God's threeness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It may be said of this essence of God that its oneness is not only not abrogated by the threeness of the ‘persons’ but rather that its oneness consists in the threeness of the ‘persons’. Whatever else we may have to say about this threeness, in no case can it  <b class="calibre3">(p. 300) </b>denote a threeness of essence. The triunity of God does not mean threefold deity either in the sense of a plurality of Gods or in the sense of the existence of a plurality of individuals or parts within the one Godhead. (I/1: 349–50 rev.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">What is true of God's self-revelation in time is true antecedently of God's being in eternity (I/1: 350). God is always God in threefold repetition, and not otherwise. The eternal God's personal, ontological, and dominical oneness subsists in and through (and only in and through) his eternal threeness, never above it or behind it. This eternal equality of essence, and the full mutual implication of God's threeness and oneness, rules out both subordinationism and modalism (I/1: 352–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Triunity of God: Trinity in Unity (I/1: 353–</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">68)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The threeness of the eternal God is no less constitutive, for Barth, than his oneness. Without God's eternal threeness God would not be the God that he is. God's oneness is logically but not ontologically prior to his threeness. Although the three cannot be defined without reference to God's indivisible essence, they are nonetheless ontologically intrinsic to that essence. God's essence, on the other hand, in so far as it is ‘simple and indivisible’, can be defined (provisionally) without reference to his threeness. The abstract logic of definitions is not to be confused with the concreteness of God's essence as intrinsically Trinitarian. The coequality of the three in status, dignity, and majesty depends, by definition, on their individual, mutual, and coeternal identity with God's concrete, indivisible (and non-generic) divine essence. Barth agreed with the Athanasian Creed: ‘The Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God’ (I/1: 349). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three are not subordinate to the essence, nor is there any ‘higher’ divine essence apart from or behind the three. The three subsist in and only in the essence, even as the reverse is also true. ‘The threeness is grounded in the one essence of the revealed God’ (I/1: 360). Therefore, ‘in denying the threeness in the oneness of God we should be referring at once to another God than the God revealed in Holy Scripture’ (I/1: 360 rev.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The three are not just an appearance to human perception with no independent or eternal reality. ‘This threeness must be regarded as irremovable, and the distinctiveness of the three modes of being must be regarded as ineffaceable’ (I/1: 361). </p>
<p class="calibre1">When it comes to naming what sort of entity the three are, Barth concluded that there is no suitable category. In this respect he was in agreement with the broad tradition, as represented for example by Augustine and Anselm (I/1: 355–6). They all understood that the three are necessarily unique in kind and therefore ineffable. Neither the Latin term  <i class="calibre4">persona</i> nor the Greek term  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> is without liabilities (I/1: 355–60, 365). The former can tend toward tritheism (if it suggests three centres of consciousness), and the latter toward modalism (if it cannot distinguish itself from  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>). For lack of a better option, <b class="calibre3">(p. 301) </b>Barth finally settled for ‘mode of being’ as a literal translation of the concept tqÖpor õp›qneyr or  <i class="calibre4">modus entitativus</i> (I/1: 359). Nothing could be more superficial than to accuse Barth of ‘modalism’ for this choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No analogies can be found for the mysterious identity of God's threeness with his oneness, and of his oneness with his threeness. ‘This is the unique divine threeness in the unique divine oneness’ (I/1: 364 rev.). For Barth as for the tradition, the three—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—are distinguished by their relations of origin (I/1: 363). </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The threeness in God's oneness is grounded in these relations’ (I/1: 364), and these relations subsist eternally in the identity of God, not just in his relations to the world (a move that directly blocks modalism) (I/1: 364). </p>
<p class="calibre1">How can a concrete, indivisible essence repeat or reproduce itself eternally as three, while still remaining eternally one? How can relations of origin still be identical with the essence itself? Finally, how can they all be identical with the essence and yet remain indissolubly distinct? These questions, Barth suggested, point to matters that are inconceivable (I/1: 367). ‘Theology means rational wrestling with the mystery’, he wrote, and good theology will see to it ‘that the  <i class="calibre4">mysterium trinitatis</i> remains a mystery’ (I/1: 368). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Triunity of God: Triunity (I/1: 368–75)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity pertains to ‘oneness in threeness’, and ‘threeness in oneness’ (I/1: 368 rev.). These antithetical formulations, Barth proposed, must be held together in a tension of unity and distinction in their mutual relations. There can be no higher synthesis. Barth explained:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We cannot advance beyond these two obviously one-sided and inadequate formulations. They are both one-sided and inadequate because a slight overemphasis on the oneness is unavoidable in the first and a slight overemphasis on the threeness is unavoidable in the second. The term ‘triunity’ is to be regarded as a conflation of the two formulae, or rather as an indication of the conflation of the two to which we cannot attain, and for which, then, we have no formula, but which we can know only as the incomprehensible truth of the object itself. (I/1: 368 rev.) Page 8 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p317"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When he observed that the doctrine requires sharp tensions and peculiar modes of thought, Barth was approaching, in his own way, the stance that the poet Keats had called </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘negative capability’, the ability to accept that not everything can be resolved. Barth felt that this stance was exemplified, among others, by Gregory of Nazianzus, whom he quoted: ‘I do not succeed in contemplating the one without being illumined on all sides by the three; I do not succeed in grasping the three without being led to the one’ (Gregory of Nazianzus,  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 40.41). ‘I am unable to think of the one without being quickly surrounded by the brilliance of the three; nor am I able to discern the three without being immediately referred to the one’ ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 40.41). The significance of statements like <b class="calibre3">(p. 302) </b>these, Barth suggested, is that they display a proper ‘dialectic in the knowledge of the triune God’ (I/1: 369). They point to something beyond themselves that remains ineffable and utterly beyond speech (I/1: 369). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea of ‘triunity’ was associated, for Barth, with two further ideas. The first involved God's internal relations as described by ‘the doctrine of perichoresis’. ‘Perichoresis’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">meant that each of the divine modes of being participated in the others without any of them losing its distinctiveness. It meant their dynamic and eternal coinherence. The distinctions among them led, through mutual interpenetration, to their being in communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The divine modes of being mutually condition and permeate one another so completely that one is always in the other two and the other two in the one’ (I/1: 370). The three dwell completely in and with one another ‘in concert as modes of being of the one God and Lord who posits Himself from eternity to eternity’ (I/1: 370). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The divine triunity also involved God's external relations as described by ‘the doctrine of appropriations’. Some of God's works are ‘appropriated’, for the sake of convenience, to a particular person of the Trinity. Creation, for example, is appropriated to the Father, reconciliation to the Son, and redemption to the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, it is understood that all three persons are involved in each of God's external works, because God himself is totally present in all his external works. In the famous phrase associated with Augustine, which Barth affirmed, ‘the external works of the Trinity are indivisible’ ( <i class="calibre4">opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa</i>) (I/1: 375). </p>
<p class="calibre1">These two ideas, Barth concluded, should be seen in dialectical contrast. On the one hand, ‘perichoresis’ signifies God's unity in Trinity ( <i class="calibre4">unitas in trinitate</i>), while on the other hand, the ‘appropriations’ show God's Trinity in unity ( <i class="calibre4">trinitas in unitate</i>). Together they represent a ‘dialectical outworking of the concept of triunity’ (I/1: 375). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Meaning of the Doctrine of the Trinity (I/1: </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">375–83)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth summed up his findings with a dialectical flourish. The oneness of God is constituted by his three modes of being as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. At the same time, God's threefold otherness is constituted by his ineffable oneness. In the doctrine of the Trinity Page 9 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">the divine mystery must be expounded through ‘oneness in threeness’ and ‘threeness in oneness’ (I/1: 375). Dialectic is the technical device by which to set forth the mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God's ontological oneness entails that the persons of the Trinity are coequal. No ‘more or less’ exists in God's being. Subordinationism must therefore be rejected (I/1: 381). God's ontological threeness, on the other hand, entails that the divine persons are also coeternal. No higher being exists in which God is not Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Modalism must be rejected as well (I/1: 382). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 303) </b>In short, God is eternally God in his three modes of being as Father, Son, and Spirit. As manifest in his self-revelation by which he wills to be ours, his external works of creation, reconciliation, and redemption have their ‘basis and prototype’ in himself, in his own essence, in his triune being as God (I/1: 383). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God the Father: God as Creator (I/1: 384–90)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Each divine person would now be examined in detail. Barth began by stating his thesis about God the Father. ‘The one God’, he wrote, ‘reveals Himself according to Scripture as the Creator, that is, as the Lord of our existence. As such He is God our Father because he is so antecedently in himself as the Father of the Son’ (I/1: 384). On the basis of scriptural revelation, God is disclosed as our Father, Creator, and Lord. What God is for us (historically) is always based on what God is in himself (eternally). God can be the heavenly Father of his historical creatures, because he is eternally the Father of the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God the Father is our Creator and Lord. As Creator, God belongs to a different ‘kind and order’ than the creature (I/1: 384). He is at once ‘absolutely distinct’ and yet also ‘absolutely related’ to the creature (I/1: 389), existing in ‘a sphere beyond human history’ (by nature) and yet also at history's ‘very centre’ (by grace) (I/1: 384). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the beyond in our midst, God the Creator is also our Lord. Although he is ‘absolutely superior’ to the creature, he does not remain aloof, but claims the creature ‘with the same absoluteness’ (I/1: 384). God's lordship cannot be reversed, as though the creature could claim lordship over God (as the benighted creature would attempt to do). The creature depends absolutely on the Lord for its existence and on the same Lord for its deliverance from death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Death in all its severity is the ‘radical crisis’ of human existence. Yet through it the Lord God intends to lead us by a ‘new birth’ to eternal life (I/1: 388). This benevolence in all its strangeness shows that the Lord God is also our Father. Human existence, Barth explained, ‘has an Author who calls it into existence and sustains it in existence, out of free goodness and according to his own free will and plan’ (I/1: 389 rev.). God our Father is the Creator who posits us as well as the Lord who judges us and delivers us from death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Our existence’, wrote Barth, ‘is sustained by him and by him alone above the abyss of non-existence’ (I/1: 389). </p>

<p class="calibre1">That our Creator and Lord is also our Father is a ‘truth of revelation’ (I/1: 389), disclosed most fully in Jesus Christ. It is in his cross and resurrection that we see both the benevolence and the severity, the sovereignty and the dreadfulness, of God. It is in Jesus that God is revealed as our Father, and it is by the Father that Jesus is unveiled as the Lord of life and death. It is in and through Jesus that ‘death is vanquished in death’ (I/1: 389). It is in and through him that we learn ‘what it means that God is our Father’ (I/1: 389). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 304) God the Father: The Eternal Father (I/1: </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">390–8)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In this and later sections Barth proceeded from God's relation to the world (who God is for us) to God's eternal self-relations (who God is in and for himself). In a trademark move he proposed the latter as the ground of the former:</p>
<p class="calibre1">God as the Father of Jesus Christ can be our Father, because—even apart from the fact that he reveals himself as such—he already is the One he reveals himself to be, namely, the Father of Jesus Christ, his Son, who as such is himself God. God can be our Father because he is Father in himself, because fatherhood is an eternal mode of being of the divine essence. (I/1: 390 rev.) God is Father by virtue of his eternal relation to the Son. ‘In this first original possibility he is God the Father in the sense of the dogma of the Trinity: the eternal Father’ (I/1: 392). This idea means that God does not first become Father by creating the world, since he is already Father in himself. It follows that his identity as Father is more basic than his identity as Creator. To put it very simply, while he has not always been Creator, he is eternally Father. God's Trinitarian self-relations are more basic than his relations to the world (I/1: 391–2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinitarian name of God as ‘Father’, Barth continued, means that ‘he is the Author of his other modes of being’ (I/1: 393). In support he quoted from the seventh-century Council of Toledo: ‘He is the font and source of the whole Godhead’. God the Father, he went on to observe, is described by the ancient Greeks as ‘God-in-Himself’ ( <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>), ‘without origin’ ( <i class="calibre4">anarchos</i>), ‘unbegotten’ ( <i class="calibre4">agenetos</i>), and ‘God over all’ ( <i class="calibre4">theos epi panton</i>). The Latins concurred by employing such terms as ‘having no origin’ ( <i class="calibre4">a nullo originem</i> <i class="calibre4">habens</i>), ‘existing in and of himself’ ( <i class="calibre4">a se ipso existens</i>), ‘unbegotten’ ( <i class="calibre4">ingenitus</i>), ‘unborn’ ( <i class="calibre4">innascibilis</i>), and the ‘principle without any anterior principle’ ( <i class="calibre4">principium sine</i> <i class="calibre4">principio</i>) (I/1: 393). At this point Barth was content with these citations. The dogmatic complexities involved were deferred until later in the discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Barth asked about the status of the term ‘Father’. Was it improper when used of God? Was it simply transferred from the creature to the Creator? (I/1: 392–4). ‘This could be said’, Barth argued, ‘only if the standard of what is proper both here and generally were our language or the created reality to which our language is related. If the Creator is the standard of what is proper for the creature and therefore for our language too, then Page 11 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">the very reverse must be said’ (I/1: 392–3). As Athanasius rightly saw, although God is </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Father’ only in some ineffable and indescribable way, the name belongs to him—not only properly but also archetypally: ‘For God is not patterned after human beings, but rather human beings after God, who is truly and pre-eminently the one Father of his own Son, and from this human beings are named fathers of their own children ( <i class="calibre4">Oratio contra Arianos</i> I, 23)’ (I/1: 393). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 305) God the Son: God as Reconciler (I/1: 399–</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">414)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Although revelation remains the dominant emphasis, attention is now accorded to reconciliation as well. While reconciliation is rightly said to entail the full deity of Jesus Christ, its deep Trinitarian grammar is only hinted at. No full-bodied explication is offered in parallel to Barth's Trinitarian interpretation of revelation. Barth did not write, as he might have: ‘ <i class="calibre4">God</i> reconciles us to himself. He  <i class="calibre4">reconciles</i> us to himself through himself. He reconciles us to  <i class="calibre4">himself</i> ’. An explicitly Trinitarian rubric—that the Father reconciles us to himself through the Son and in the Spirit—is not exploited. God is not set forth in threefold repetition as the Reconciler, the objective Act of reconciliation, and the subjective impartation of reconciliation. Nevertheless, Barth's interrelation of reconciliation and revelation is very interesting and well worth careful attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth stated his thesis as follows: ‘The one God reveals Himself according to Scripture as the Reconciler, i.e. as the Lord in the midst of our enmity towards Him. As such he is the Son of God who has come to us or the Word of God that has been spoken to us, because he is so antecedently in himself as the Son or Word of God the Father’ (I/1: 399). This statement focuses more on God's oneness than on his threeness. Jesus Christ is set forth as the Lord who enjoys a differentiated oneness in being with the Father. As with revelation, so with reconciliation, it is his divine identity that serves as the condition for the possibility of his reconciling work. Three lines of argument for Christ's deity are presented: from scripture, from revelation, and from reconciliation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From scripture, it is shown that Jesus is depicted neither as an idealized human being (the Ebionite tendency) nor as a mythologized idea (the Docetic tendency). Both tendencies miss ‘the dialectic present in the New Testament itself’ as it bears witness to the mystery of the Incarnation (I/1: 404). One strand focuses on Jesus’ humanity and attests that he is God (the Synoptics), while another reverses the procedure by spotlighting his deity and attesting that he is human (the Gospel of John). The divine identity of the human Jesus is presented not by a synthesis of two separate ideas, but by analytical statements in dialectical form (I/1: 404). </p>
<p class="calibre1">From revelation, certain now familiar themes receive a specific, Christological variation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus would not be God's revelation as the Lord unless he were himself the Lord. ‘Who can reveal God except God himself?’ (I/1: 406). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">From reconciliation, it is shown that sin could not have been removed and death defeated by Christ unless he were God with us in the flesh (I/1: 410–11). Only God incarnate could have reconciled us to God. Reconciliation is the absolute miracle by which fellowship with God is restored, despite human wilfulness and enmity, through the cross and resurrection of the incarnate Son (I/1: 413). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strong emphasis on revelation as a noetic concept has now been counterbalanced by reconciliation as a theme that is predominantly ontic. In Barth's theology ontic and noetic elements are always dialectically paired, and serious mistakes of interpretation  <b class="calibre3">(p. 306)</b> can occur when this pairing is not noticed. Here Barth went so far as to state that ‘revelation is itself reconciliation’ (I/1: 409), though what he meant is not that they are strictly equivalent but rather that they are mutually entailed by one other. Both are variously identical with the divine-human person of Jesus Christ as the Lord, whose person is always one with his work, for he is never the source, for Barth (as for the whole Reformation), of some benefit other than himself (I/1: 412). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God the Son: The Eternal Son (I/1: 414–47)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The identity of Jesus, as attested in scripture, points to his identity as the eternal Son. It is only because of this divine identity that he can reveal and reconcile us to the Father. He does not first become God's Son in these events. He is antecedently the divine Son in himself. ‘Down to the very depths of deity’, wrote Barth, ‘as the ultimate thing that is to be said about God, God is God the Son as he is God the Father. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God himself as God his Father is God himself’ (I/1: 414). Regarding Jesus Christ as God's ‘only-begotten Son’, three points may be singled out for comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the uniqueness of Christ's eternal divine identity underscores the uniqueness of his saving work. ‘The phrase “only-begotten” ’, wrote Barth, ‘first emphasises the oneness—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which means the exclusiveness and uniqueness—of the revelation and reconciliation enacted in Jesus Christ’ (I/1: 424 rev.). His work is exclusively unique, because his divine person is exclusively unique (I/1: 425). Second, God's eternal Trinitarian identity is primordial and basic. Nothing is or can be antecedent to it. While God freely affirms who he is, he cannot be other than he is:</p>
<p class="calibre1">God cannot not be God. Therefore—and this is the same thing—he cannot not be Father and cannot be without the Son. His freedom or aseity in respect of himself consists in his freedom, not determined by anything but himself, to be God, and that means to be the Father of the Son. A freedom to be able not to be this would be an abrogation of his freedom. (I/1: 434)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The begetting of the Son therefore differs from the work of creation. The Father's begetting of the Son ‘could not not happen just as God could not not be God’. By contrast, if God had chosen not to create the world, he ‘would not on that account be any the less God’ (I/1: 434). What it means for God to be God, in all divine a-seity and freedom, is that Page 13 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">God is the Father of the Son. God's identity as God, and therefore as the Holy Trinity, is not discretionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the Father's begetting of the Son is utterly ineffable. This begetting is neither an emanation nor an act of causation. The one would tend toward modalism, the other toward subordinationism.  <i class="calibre4">Homoousios</i> means that the Father and the Son are not two different subjects but ‘twice the same subject in indissoluble twofoldness’ (I/1: 439 rev.) They are ‘two who are two only in their mutual relations and not in themselves, not in their essence’ (I/1: 439). <b class="calibre3">(p. 307)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The one real essence in two real modes of being is God Himself and God alone. He himself and alone is both Father and Son, Speaker and Word, light and light, original and copy. From him the created, sinful creature receives the truth of its relationships by revelation. (I/1: 440) God as God is the Son begotten by the Father, and the Father who begets the Son, beyond all categories of emanation or causation. There is no oneness without their distinction, and no distinction without their oneness, to all eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God the Holy Spirit: God as Redeemer (I/1: </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">448–66)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth again began by stating his thesis:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The one God reveals himself according to Scripture as the Redeemer, i.e. as the Lord who sets us free. As such he is the Holy Spirit, by receiving whom we become the children of God, because, as the Spirit of the love of God the Father and the Son, he is so antecedently in himself. (I/1: 448)</p>
<p class="calibre1">His general category for presenting the Holy Spirit's work was ‘redemption’. The concept of redemption, at this stage of Barth's thinking, seems somewhat elusive. Unlike his concepts of revelation and reconciliation, its features are not easy to make out. The forest, so to speak, is less clear than the trees. Nevertheless, the following outlines may be suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Objectively, as Barth conceives of them, both revelation and reconciliation in Christ are a finished and perfect work. Nothing could possibly be added to their content, nor does anything need to be added (I/1: 451, 452). Subjectively, however, revelation and reconciliation still need to be imparted (I/1: 453). Impartation is what happens in and through the Spirit. Redemption is the future of revelation and reconciliation. In ‘the future consummating act of God which is still to come’ (I/1: 409), they will both be imparted not only universally to all, but also to each one in particular. This universal and particular impartation, as provisionally under way here and now, is what is meant by redemption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 14 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Holy Spirit as God the Redeemer is the eschatological principle of communion (i.e. of active participation in Christ), of universalization, and of particularization. The Spirit operates to bring all things (both individually and as a totality) into union with Christ and his saving work of revelation and reconciliation. All things are in the process of being liberated and set free for union and communion with Christ. Provisionally, this liberation takes place in and through the Church, but is ultimately appointed to embrace the whole creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two terms that Barth borrowed from Quenstedt can help to make this process clear: <i class="calibre4">opere perfectus</i> and  <i class="calibre4">operatione perpetuus</i> (I/1: 427). Just because the work of Christ is a perfect work ( <i class="calibre4">opere perfectus</i>), it involves a perpetual operation ( <i class="calibre4">operatione perpetuus</i>) <b class="calibre3">(p. 308) </b>in the Spirit. It does not remain encapsulated in the past but radiates out in the Spirit to encompass, liberate, and transform all things. Redemption in and by the Spirit effects the wondrous transition from a universal  <i class="calibre4">participatio Christi</i> that is objective, passive, and hidden to one that is subjective, active, and manifest in glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Redemption involves the absolute future as it breaks into the present and imparts itself here and now (I/1: 452). It imparts the freedom to receive and participate in revelation, reconciliation, and worship, both now and for ever, as children of God. And it imparts this freedom in a way that is ecclesial and finally cosmic in scope. At this stage in Barth's thinking, however, the emphasis regarding redemption fell mainly on revelation and its reception by the individual ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. I/1: 456). Reconciliation's subjective actualization by the Spirit here and now, while not unmentioned, was very much spoken  <i class="calibre4">sotto voce</i> (I/1: 450, 458), while the transcendent theme of worship received almost no mention at all ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. I/1: 462, 466). The great strengths of this magnificent Trinitarian vision are thus offset by some awkward imbalances. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">God the Holy Spirit: The Eternal Spirit (I/1: </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">466–89)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth's discussion of the Trinity has been guided throughout by a basic rule: ‘What [God] </p>
<p class="calibre1">is in revelation he is antecedently in himself’ (I/1: 466). The Father as revealed in Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">cross and resurrection was shown to be, antecedently, the eternal Father of the Son. Likewise, it was shown that Jesus could not be the act of revelation and reconciliation, as attested in scripture, if he himself were not antecedently fully God as the eternal Son. It remains only to show that the Holy Spirit who imparts revelation and reconciliation is antecedently the eternal Spirit of the Father and the Son. The point of greatest interest in this final section is how Barth treated the vexed question of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> clause. His case rested on applying the basic rule:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even supporters of the Eastern view do not contest the fact that in the  <i class="calibre4">opus ad extra</i> [‘work outside God’], and therefore in revelation (and then retrospectively in creation), the Holy Spirit is to be understood as the Spirit of both the Father and the Son. But we have consistently followed the rule, which we regard as basic, Page 15 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">that statements about the divine modes of being antecedently in themselves cannot be different in content from those that are to be made about their reality in revelation. All our statements concerning what is called the immanent Trinity have been reached simply as confirmations or underlinings or, materially, as the indispensable premises of the economic Trinity. (I/1: 479) Just as the Holy Spirit operates as the principle of communion whereby we are united through the Son to the Father, so also does the Spirit operate antecedently in eternity as the principle of communion between the Father and the Son (I/1: 180). As in time, so in eternity, it is a matter of ‘two-sided fellowship’ (I/1: 180). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 309) </b>In explaining the Son as the ‘only-begotten’ of the Father, Barth had side-stepped (without even discussing it) the vexatious Cappadocian idea of the Father's ‘monarchy’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This idea held that the Son was ‘caused’ by the Father so that the Son ‘derived’ his essence from him, because the divine essence belonged to the Father antecedently ‘before’ it belonged to the Son. Although it was insisted that the Father's ‘causal’ role in imparting the divine essence to the Son did not undermine their essential coequality, the lasting suspicion of subordinationism (however unjust) was hard to shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth, it will be recalled, argued, by contrast, two very different points: first, that the mode of begetting was not causal but ineffable; and second, that the one indivisible divine Subject eternally posited himself as ‘twice the same subject in indissoluble twofoldness’, namely, as the Father who eternally begets the Son and as the Son eternally begotten of the Father. The two in their mutual relations belong intrinsically, coequally, and irreducibly to the one essence of the Lord God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth's solution to the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> problem was similar. The idea of ‘procession’ was ineffable and utterly beyond all categorization. As God is the Father, he begets himself as the Son. As God is the Son, he is begotten of himself as the Father. In this eternal begetting and being begotten, God posits himself a third time as the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son. ‘He is the Father of the Son in such a way that with the Son he brings forth the Spirit, love, and is in himself the Spirit, love’ (I/1: 483). The Spirit has ‘not a twofold but a common origin’ from the one essence of the Father and the Son in their active, mutual interrelations of communion in love (I/1: 486–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In conclusion, it is clear that for Barth the triune God's oneness of essence and threeness of modalities can only be conceived dialectically. The one divine Subject subsists eternally in (and only in) three irreducibly distinct modes of being—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—and yet these modes are not three independently acting ‘persons’ but rather one and the same acting Subject in threefold form. There is only one real Subjectivity in God, which the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each has, fully and distinctively, in his own way. As such the ‘persons’ serve as the eternally antecedent ground, premise, and precondition for all God's external works of revelation, reconciliation, and redemption (as well as creation). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Some Protestant Doctrines After Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Three Protestant doctrines of the Trinity after Barth will now be sketched: those of Moltmann, Pannenberg, and Jüngel. Perhaps the best way to relate these doctrines to Barth would be through ‘Rahner's Rule’. Rahner famously wrote: ‘The economic Trinity  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the economic Trinity’ (Rahner 1970: 22). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This Rule, which is systematically ambiguous, has led to a great deal of confusion. Although not necessarily incorrect, much depends on how it is interpreted. It is  <b class="calibre3">(p. 310) </b>susceptible to a Barthian interpretation. This interpretation is, in effect, adhered to by Jüngel, at least partially, but not by Moltmann or Pannenberg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Barthian interpretation would run as follows. The Rule is correct in so far as there is only one Holy Trinity existing in two distinct forms. It is incorrect, however, in so far as it suggests that the distinction between the forms can be collapsed. If the Trinity's ‘immanent’ form is eternal, while its ‘economic’ form is temporal or historical, then to collapse the two forms would be to collapse the distinction between time and eternity, and thus between God and the world. The proper relation between the two forms—eternal and historical—as Barth saw it, is one of ‘correspondence’. Together the two forms of the one Holy Trinity comprise a ‘unity-in-distinction’, but not a ‘dialectical identity’—as if when looked at in one way the Trinity was eternal but in another way it was historical, or as if eternity and history were merely two sides of a single process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Barth, the Trinity's temporal form is secondary and dependent, while its eternal form is primary and constitutive. The eternal Trinity is distinguished, among other things, by the simplicity, perfection and a-seity (or self-sufficiency) of its essence ( <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>). For Barth, with the main catholic tradition, East and West, God just is the Holy Trinity. As a self-sufficient communion of love and freedom, joy and peace, God's identity would be triune whether the world had been created or not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God would be no less God if he had created no world and no human being. The existence of the world and our own existence are in no sense vital to God, not even as the object of his love. The eternal generation of the Son by the Father tells us first and supremely that God is not at all lonely even without the world and us. His love has its object in himself (I/1: 139–40 rev.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This statement, which dates from the very outset of Barth's dogmatics in 1932, was explicitly reaffirmed by him in 1968, the final year of his life, as well as several times in between. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two forms of one and the same Trinity coexist, for Barth, in a pattern of unity, distinction, and irreversible asymmetry. It is a relation of correspondence in which the Trinity's eternal form enjoys unqualified precedence over its historical form at every point. The Trinity's eternal form is revealed by way of its historical form, but its historical form is utterly contingent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 17 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is this relation of correspondence that Rahner's Rule threatens (unwittingly) to disrupt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither Moltmann nor Pannenberg nor Jüngel managed to uphold it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No such correspondence could be maintained by Moltmann, in part because he attempted to define the divine oneness entirely by means of  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i>. He allotted no place for the idea of a divine  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> as something simple, perfect, and sufficient in itself. He suggested (against Rahner) that the three persons of the Trinity should be thought of as three </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘subjects’ or ‘centers of activity’ (Moltmann 1981: 145, 156; cf. 175). Against Barth he rejected the idea of a self-identical divine Subject subsisting in (and only in) three modes of being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We must dispense with both the concept of the one substance and the concept of the identical subject. All that remains is: the unitedness, the at-oneness of the three Persons with one another, or: the unitedness, the at-oneness of the triune God…. This means  <b class="calibre3">(p. 311) </b>that the concept of God's unity … must be perceived in the  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> of the divine persons. (Moltmann 1981: 150) Although Moltmann believed that this proposal avoided Arianism and modalism, it was unclear how it could avoid tritheism. Moltmann also rejected any strong distinction between ‘God for us’ and ‘God in himself’ (Moltmann 1981: 151). They were two sides of the same coin. God's eternity was not an independent realm over against history. It was rather a transcendent dimension of history. In a broadly Hegelian way, what Moltmann proposed was the ‘historicization of eternity’. Time and eternity were objectively constituted by their mutual relations in ‘dialectical identity’. The ‘economic’ Trinity and the ‘immanent’ Trinity fitted together as though in a figure-ground drawing. Looked at in one way the Trinity was ‘economic’ as the object of preaching and practical theology. Looked at in another way, it was the ‘immanent’ Trinity of doxological theology. ‘The two form a continuity and merge into one another’ (Moltmann 1981: 152). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, it may be noted that the unity of the triune God was conceived as being ‘eschatological’ rather than perfectly eternal. God would not be one in and for himself until he was also one with the world and the world with him. ‘The unity of the Father, the Son and the Spirit is then the eschatological question about the consummation of the Trinitarian history of God’ (Moltmann 1981: 149). This Trinitarian history was very much a being-in-suffering as well as a being-in-act. ‘The pain of the cross determines the inner life of the triune God from eternity to eternity’ (Moltmann 1981: 161). God's co-dependency in suffering with the world meant that God would not finally be God until all imperfections, divine and human, were overcome. ‘The doctrine of the immanent Trinity is part of eschatology as well’ (Moltmann 1981: 161). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pannenberg's doctrine of the Trinity involved a more complex eschatology along with a similar suggestion that in some sense God existed in codependency with the world. Like Moltmann, Pannenberg abandoned the idea of God's absolute perfection and unqualified self-sufficiency. The perfection of God's essence was somehow subsequent, contingent, and teleological rather than (as for Barth) antecedent, necessary, and primordial. At this Page 18 of 21</p>

<p class="calibre1">point the difference between the other two theologians and Barth was roughly the difference between a ‘Hegelian’ and an ‘Anselmian’ sensibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curiously, for Pannenberg, God's eternal being somehow becomes a function of his historical being; and the immanent Trinity, a function of the economic Trinity. Although Pannenberg was careful not to eliminate all antecedence and a-seity from God, he could affirm them only in a qualified sense. It seems as though the Lord God could not create and enter into the world without becoming impaired by it and dependent upon it. ‘Even in his deity’, wrote Pannenberg, ‘[God] has made himself dependent on the course of history’ (Pannenberg 1991: 129). Although ‘the Trinitarian God is complete in himself prior to his relation to the world’ (Pannenberg 1991: 391), that was not the whole story. For </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘with the creation of a world God's deity and even his existence become dependent on the fulfillment of their determination in his present lordship’ (Pannenberg 1991: 390). Whatever else this startling claim may mean, it implies that after creating the world God <b class="calibre3">(p. 312) </b>was ontologically diminished and could not retrieve himself without retrieving the world. God had subjected his deity and even his existence, if only provisionally, to a nexus of cosmological contingencies, obscurities, and imperfections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, eternity was historicized and subjected to an eschatological scheme. The results were complicated. The divine essence could already be what it would be (in the absolute future), though it was not yet so in itself, by virtue of a combined principle of prolepsis and simultaneity. The absolute telos toward which God was in the process of guiding himself and all history exercised a kind of boomerang effect in eternity.  <i class="calibre4">Sub specie aeternitatis</i>, God's essence simultaneously was, and still was not yet, what it would be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From a more historical standpoint, God's essence was under construction by the three persons of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This boomerang effect from history to eternity by way of teleology goes a long way toward clarifying some of Pannenberg's truly cryptic ideas. For example, once God becomes enmeshed in history (by creating the world), the essence of the eternal Trinity is determined, and effectively constituted, by the historical actions of the Trinitarian persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God's Trinitarian essence ( <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>) is eternal only by way of its fulfillment in the absolute future (which is indeed the only absolute in this scheme). The unity of God's essence is thus not independent of history (Pannenberg 1991: 365), but is ‘realized in relation to the world’ (Pannenberg 1991: 445). The essence common to the Trinitarian persons is the content of their actions in history (Pannenberg 1991: 444). The immanent Trinity is determined and effectively constituted by the economic actions of the three persons by virtue of their teleological consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In relating the economic Trinity to the immanent Trinity, not even Eberhard Jüngel resisted the slide from ‘unity-in-distinction’ to ‘dialectical identity’. Recall that the pattern of unity-in-distinction had allowed Barth to assert the antecedence of the immanent Trinity as something pure and absolute. God's Trinitarian being was in no sense constituted by a relationship to anything other than himself. The perfection, indivisibility, and self-sufficiency of God's eternal being ( <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>) was logically and ontologically independent of God's Page 19 of 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Barth's Doctrine of the Trinity, and Some Protestant Doctrines after</b> <b class="calibre3">Barth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">relationship to the world or anything in the world. Not even the human Jesus was necessary to God's eternal self-existence as the Holy Trinity. The Lord God's relationship to Jesus, and to the world through Jesus, involved an act of Trinitarian self-repetition, not self-realization. For Barth, the Trinity's self-repetition in history was not necessary but free, not constitutive but gracious, not primordial but subsequent and miraculous. The Trinity's self-repetition and self-manifestation in history corresponded to its prior self-realization in eternity, and together they coexisted in inseparable unity. But their abiding distinction meant that God was and would be the Holy Trinity, eternally, with or without the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his doctrine of the Trinity, Jüngel was able to follow Barth at many points. The main difference, however, was that Jüngel surrendered the Trinity's eternal antecedence as something pure, self-subsisting and absolute. Pure antecedence was replaced by the idea of dialectical identity. For Jüngel, one could not think of God as God without referring at the same time to the human Jesus. The death of Jesus belonged to the concept of God's deity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God's eternal being ( <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>) was determined by his relation to the Crucified. <b class="calibre3">(p. 313)</b> A doctrine of God which takes its bearings from the man Jesus must … have a twofold emphasis. First, God comes indeed from God and only from God; he is determined by no one and nothing other than by himself alone…. But, second, in his self-determination God comes to be himself precisely in coming to man…. God comes from God; but he does not wish to come to himself without us. God comes to himself—but with man. (Jüngel 1983: 37 rev.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea is explicitly rejected that God could ‘come to himself’, and so be perfectly God, without also ‘coming to man’ (Jüngel 1983: 37n). ‘Thus, God's humanity belongs to his divinity’ (Jüngel 1983: 37). God cannot be thought of as God ‘without thinking of him simultaneously as the Crucified’ (Jüngel 1983: 39). The Trinity subsists with the Cross in a nexus of mutual ontological implication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eternity is seen as an aspect of history, and history as an aspect of eternity. They converge in the human Jesus at the point of his crucifixion—a convergence that gains universal significance through his resurrection. The eternal Trinity is not antecedent to the historical Trinity but coincident with it. They are two distinct but interlocking aspects of Jesus’ crucifixion as negated by his resurrection. In this complex interrelationship, ‘God's being is in coming’ (Jüngel 1983: 380)—in three ways. As the Father, God comes  <i class="calibre4">from</i> himself as his own origin. As the Son, he comes  <i class="calibre4">to</i> himself as his own goal through a love that embraces suffering and death. Finally, as the Holy Spirit, he comes as his own mediation  <i class="calibre4">through</i> himself as the future of that love which brings life from death (Jüngel 1983: 380–9). God's being is nothing other than this event, and this threefold coming is what is meant by eternity (Jüngel 1983: 380). The immanent Trinity is not a doctrine of pure antecedence, but a ‘summarizing concept’ for the economic Trinity (Jüngel 1983: 346). </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines developments in Catholic theology on the Trinity, focusing on the thoughts and works of Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. It argues that Rahner's and von Balthasar's Trinitarian theology arose from a more fully historical theology of grace derived from Maurice Blondel. It explains that Rahner and von Balthasar attempted to reintegrate the more abstract notion of the divine essence into the historical revelation of the Trinity: Rahner through the self-communication of God rooted in the gracious dynamism that is our created spiritual existence and von Balthasar through his Trinitarian dramatics in which the Son undergoes the wrath of the Father for us. </p>

<p class="calibre1">KARL Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar have acquired a status in contemporary Catholic theology comparable to that which Protestant theology gives to Karl Barth, and in a lesser degree to Wolfhart Pannenberg or Jürgen Moltmann. No major work of contemporary Catholic Trinitarian theology disregards the epistemological orientations or the main theses that the two theologians elaborated in their respective works. If, in terms of decisive influence, Rahner has the advantage on von Balthasar, this is due not to the breadth of his work but to certain methodological and structural motifs that henceforth orient the new treatise on the Trinity. One cannot understand twentieth century Trinitarian theology without reference to the sources of the renewal that profoundly marked it. If the Trinitarian theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar can be considered as one of the most representative of the twentieth century, this is due on the one hand to the unequalled full</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> ness of its ‘theodramatic’ specificity, and on the other hand to the theological dispute which set it in ever deeper opposition to the fundamental orientations of Rahnerian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 315) </b>This takes us to the complex debates about the supernatural in its relation to human nature which is capable of God, which ended in the formulation of Karl Rahner's fundamental axiom ( <i class="calibre4">Grundaxiom</i>) according to which ‘the Trinity of the economy of salvation is the immanent Trinity, and vice versa’ (Rahner 1960 and 1967). This axiom is the direct outcome of a theology of grace which tries to understand grace, not primarily as a participation in the divine nature considered abstractly, but according to the dynamic of a differentiated and immediate relation with each of the divine persons, which is the mark of revealed Trinitarian faith. Trinitarian doctrine and its new architecture are closely bound up with the theology of grace, and derive from it. This articulation of the meaning of grace, often omitted in contemporary histories of Trinitarian thought, is partly attributable to the apologetics of immanence developed in Maurice Blondel's  <i class="calibre4">L’Action</i> (1893). The question of the desire for God and its possible fulfilment will find in a theology of Trinitarian indwelling, drawn from the concrete expressions of Scripture, the resources that make it possible to get beyond the limits on each side, namely the aporias of extrinsicism and immanentism of grace. By underscoring the distinction of Trinitarian persons acting in the work of salvation, while showing the unity and communion of their undivided action, theologians sought first to recast the mode of knowing proper to Trinitarian faith. It will be economic and more closely connected to the theology of grace (Blondel 1950</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1893): 407 n. 1). From the pen of Blondel there appears what would become the measure of contemporary Trinitarian theology, which Walter Kasper will express in an emblematic formulation, summarizing the complexity of the contemporary Trinitarian movement born in the context of a reform of the theology of grace: The Trinitarian self-revelation of God ( <i class="calibre4">Die trinitarische Selbstoffenbarung Gottes</i>) implies as such the transcendent response to the question which humanity does not just  <i class="calibre4">have</i> ( <i class="calibre4">nicht nur hat</i>), but which it  <i class="calibre4">is</i> ( <i class="calibre4">sondern ist</i>): the question of God…. In the face of the radical questioning of Christian faith, a vague, general, bloodless theism can be of no help to us; the only thing which can help us is the decisive witness of the living God of history ( <i class="calibre4">das entschiedene Zeugnis vom lebendigen Gott</i> <i class="calibre4">der Geschichte</i>), which is concretely revealed by Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theodramatics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The project of a  <i class="calibre4">theodramatic</i> of Trinitarian dimension constitutes the major contribution of von Balthasar to Trinitarian theology. It takes up the whole of the last volume of the <i class="calibre4">Theo-Drama</i>, which is called  <i class="calibre4">Das Endspiel</i>, that is, the final act. This ‘dramatic’ and Trinitarian soteriology is centred on the Pauline doctrine of salvation through the cross. Its leading concept is that of ‘mission’, with its two terminological variants  <i class="calibre4">Sendung</i> (sending) and  <i class="calibre4">Auftrag</i> (task), through which the filial identity of Jesus can be wholly <b class="calibre3">(p. 316) </b>interpreted as obedience ( <i class="calibre4">Gehorsam</i>) to the Father in the Spirit for the salvation of men. This radically soteriological orientation involves a specific concept of the relation between the economic and the immanent Trinity, discussed at length in von Balthasar's work and a major point of dispute with his counterpart Karl Rahner. Unlike Rahner, von Balthasar did not confer a revelatory or phenomenological function to this relation so as to set, in the form of an axiom, the identity between the being of God and his manifestation in the incarnate Word. In other words, von Balthasar does not primarily conceive the Rahnerian axiom in terms of simple identity or dynamic correlation, but as a ‘paradoxical’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">relation which is dominated by the central Christological theme of the Son's obedience even unto substitutionary death ( <i class="calibre4">Stellvertretung</i>), where God's judgement on human sin dissolves itself in love. This act of envelopment ( <i class="calibre4">Unterfassung</i>), by which the Father reclaims ( <i class="calibre4">übernehmen</i>) the creation from its subjection to the contradictory power of sin, depends on the modes of relation of the divine persons in the economy ( <i class="calibre4">die ökonomischen</i> <i class="calibre4">Modi der Relationen</i>), and has its condition of possibility in the intra-Trinitarian exchanges, without adding anything alien to these internal exchanges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The complexity of this ‘dramatic’ Trinitarian theology must be preserved with all the nuances that it requires. Its first and quasi-axiomatic component is the Christological motif of ‘substitution’, the New Testament echo of the Old Testament theology of divine judgement and of its corollary, the ‘wrath’ of God that confronts in the Son the contradiction of our sin. The purpose of Jesus’ mission ( <i class="calibre4">Sendung</i>) is to reconcile the world with God (2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cor. 5:18; Rom. 8:3). This mission is directed to a ‘task’ ( <i class="calibre4">Auftrag</i>) that includes the charge of vanquishing sin and its ultimate consequences at their root. The meaning of the Son's <i class="calibre4">pro nobis</i> cannot henceforth simply signify ‘on our behalf’. It goes further than that. This is the reason why the Swiss theologian disjoins sin from its individuation in the human sinner, in order to consider it in itself, as a reality opposed to God, as the conscious and deliberate rejection of God and of his revealed Word (the  <i class="calibre4">mysterium iniquitatis</i>). It is precisely the confrontation of this ‘reality’ that governs the central theme of the Father's ‘forsaking’ ( <i class="calibre4">Verlassenheit</i>) of the Son in the night of abandonment, even to the supreme ordeal of the ‘loss’ of the Father. Von Balthasar introduces here an unexpected aspect, but one that is fully consistent with the integral dimensions of this Trinitarian soteriology. It regards the motif of the timelessness ( <i class="calibre4">die Zeitlosigkeit</i>) experienced by the Son on the cross: ‘This condition must have sufficient “space” ( <i class="calibre4">Raum</i>) for the (infernal) experience of sinners abandoned by God, in two aspects: the intensity of the Son's forsakenness ( <i class="calibre4">Verlassenheit</i>) on the Cross and its worldwide extension’ (von Balthasar 1983: 280–1; 1998: Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> 308). We touch here upon the ultimate consequences that follow from the Christological principle described earlier. For von Balthasar, it is clear that the ‘taking over of the loss of God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Übernahme des Gottverlustes</i>), deserved by sinners, is only possible on the foundation of the envelopment ( <i class="calibre4">Unterfassung</i>) by the Son who, because of his uniqueness, experiences in a unique degree what can be called the possible loss of the presence of the Father. The Son takes on himself the perdition of sinners according to a degree proper to the uniqueness of his filial condition. This ‘uniqueness’ ( <i class="calibre4">Einmaligkeit</i>) does not result simply from the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father. It should be interpreted not only ontologically, but also relationally. This unique <b class="calibre3">(p. 317) </b>ness is a uniqueness of relationship and mutual dependence between the Father and the Son, a uniqueness of exchange within the Trinity, to which the Spirit contributes according to his property as communicated and received Gift. It is thus necessary to avoid every form of Christomonism in order to appreciate the work of redemption and to measure its true Trinitarian dimensions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit acts with a ‘mobility’ that allows him, within the drama of salvation and in accord with the law of the economy, to keep open the ‘diastasis’ between the Father and the Son. What thus appears on the level of the economy as the sign of separation is only possible because of the unity of the Father and the Son sealed in the Spirit. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘reversal’ ( <i class="calibre4">Umkehrung</i>) results from the fact that, in the Passion, human sin is placed naked before God and concentrated in the crucified Son (2 Cor. 5:21): This reversal is not the result of a divine decision coming ‘from outside’; it is made possible by the fact that the Son's God-forsakenness is drawn into the love relationship within the Trinity ( <i class="calibre4">die Einbeziehung der Gottverlassenheit in die trinitarische Liebesbeziehung</i>). The Son takes the estrangement ( <i class="calibre4">Entfernung</i>) into himself and creates proximity: nearness between God and man on the basis of the union between Father and Son that is held fast through every darkness and forsakenness. The Son experienced separation when he was bearing the world's sin, but this separation was not a remoteness from the Father, for he aligned himself continually to the Father, he looked back to the Father constantly in order to stand in the exact center of his mission ( <i class="calibre4">Sendung</i>). (von Balthasar 1983: 236; 1998: 261) Here we see the central concept of ‘mission’, to which von Balthasar accords a particular status. At the level of the economy, the Son's knowledge of the Father is mediated by the mission, which thereby receives a timeless ( <i class="calibre4">unzeitlich</i>) status. It is coextensive with the Father's act of generation, included in it, since ‘the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot … was foreordained before the foundation of the world’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">in order to undergo this death for sin (1 Pet. 1:19–20). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Christological principle that we have termed a ‘uniqueness of exchange’ flows back upon Trinitarian doctrine as such, not in a simple relationship of continuity, but in a logical paradox which follows from the event of the Incarnation being ordered to the Passion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the Son on the cross literally experiences the love of the Father in the form of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘wrath’, conforming to the Old Testament theology of judgement without which the death of the Son would be incomprehensible. The conciliation, apparently contradictory, between ‘wrath’ and ‘love’ comes about in the result of the cross, a conciliation that enables Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> one to avoid two insufficient interpretations of the event, one reading the Passion as the unfurling of the divine wrath on the innocent victim, the other regarding the passion simply as an expression of the superabundance of the divine love. If we stay within the perspective of the Old Testament, Christ's suffering on the cross would only be understood as a punishment which proportions retribution according to one's works (Deut. 30:15–19). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The New Covenant sealed in Christ subverts this symmetrical relation. There is literally a shift ( <i class="calibre4">Äonwende</i>), a concept which one could translate as ‘change of aeon’. In place of the perfect symmetry between the promise and the threat, the benediction and the curse, comes the asymmetry of a ‘taking over’ of the sin that merits con <b class="calibre3">(p. 318) </b>demnation in the unique destiny of the Son who takes its ultimate consequences on himself: ‘Now there is a fundamental  <i class="calibre4">asymmetry</i> ( <i class="calibre4">eine grundsätzliche Asymmetrie</i>) in so far as God's judgement has been pronounced once and for all in the Cross and Resurrection of Jesus’ (von Balthasar 1983: 251; 1998: 277). The Trinitarian dramatic that von Balthasar deploys requires this Old Testament horizon. The cross of Christ is interpreted in light of the change of the aeons ( <i class="calibre4">Äonwende</i>), which affects the traditional theology of Judgement. From the Old to the New Covenant, the shift takes place integrally and is resolved in the cross of the mediator which is in itself the sole judgement (Jn 12:31; Rom. 5:15, 21). </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have described, as precisely as possible, what constitutes the heart of von Balthasar's Trinitarian soteriology, by analysing one of the most representative texts in which it is found. It is necessary, however, to take one additional step. This central dimension of the economy of salvation is and can only be the expression of an intra-Trinitarian reality. It owes its existence to a single truth, that of the Son in the Father and the Father in the Son. Von Balthasar defends himself vigorously against the accusation of having promoted a theology of the ‘tragic God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Prozess Gottes</i>), just as he rejects a ‘dialectical’ interpretation of the coincidence of opposites, as if the divine achieved its plenitude by assuming the negativity of sin and of contradiction: ‘So we cannot speak of a “process” in God, as if he could attain fullness only through the world's sinful alienation from him and through his Son's Cross’ (von Balthasar 1983: 239; 1998: 264). To a dialectical logic, von Balthasar opposes a logic of ‘paradox’ that finds its source in the undeniable permanence of the substantial unity of the Father and the Son, a unity of gift and of perfect communion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Karl Rahner's Trinitarian theology is developed in very different directions from that of von Balthasar, and in language that is more conceptual than imagistic. One can set forth its fundamental axes and content in the form of some synthetic propositions. To do this, we will refer to the major texts in which it was developed, especially in the fifteen years between 1950 and 1965. The primary feature of Rahnerian Trinitarian theology is the close connection which it establishes between the theology of grace and Trinitarian theol</p>

For Rahner, this relation of dependence constitutes the proper mode of knowledge of God the Trinity, and this in two ways: on the one hand, that of the immediate presence of God in the soul by an originating communication of grace, and, on the other hand, that of the historical event of the Incarnation of the only Word, which Rahner defines as the victoriously irreversible apex of the self-speaking ( <i class="calibre4">Selbstzusage</i>) and self-expression ( <i class="calibre4">Selbstaussage</i>) of God in history. Rahner's verdict on the classical theology  <b class="calibre3">(p. 319) </b>of the manuals is rather severe. Following the very erudite works of Théodore de Régnon, published in four volumes between 1892 and 1898, Rahner assumes that the so-called ‘Latin’ and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Greek’ models of Trinitarian doctrine are quite distinct, with the Greek highlighting the distinction of the hypostases and founding the doctrine of consubstantiality on the divine monarchy identified with the fontal person of the Father. The verdict is apparent in the most successful treatise that Rahner wrote:</p>
<p class="calibre1">If, with Scripture and the Greeks, we mean by  <i class="calibre4">ho Theos</i> in the first place the Father (not letting the word simply ‘suppose’ for the Father), then the Trinitarian structure of the Apostles’ Creed, in line with Greek theology of the Trinity, would lead us to treat first of the Father…. The Bible and the Greeks would have us start from the one unoriginate God, who is already  <i class="calibre4">Father</i> even when nothing is known as yet about generation and spiration. He is known as the one unoriginate hypostasis which is not  <i class="calibre4">positively</i> conceived as ‘absolute’ even before it is explicitly known as relative. (Rahner 1967: 371; 1970: 16–17)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deploring the isolation of Trinitarian doctrine, Rahner recommends that Trinitarian theology be rooted in the approach by which the God of revelation manifests himself to men through the mission of the Son and the sanctifying gift of the Spirit. In light of the resources of Scripture and tradition, he explores the relationship established by grace between the three divine persons and the human subject of this gracious communication. By this twofold approach, reducible to the unity of its principle—the freely offered gift of divine life—Rahner suggests that one is freed from a conception of the relationship between God and man that relies on the overly ‘extrinsic’ model of ‘created grace’ produced by way of efficient causality. Thus, the keyword of Rahner's Trinitarian theology is the concept of self-communication, which presupposes that the beatifying character of the contemplation of the Trinity requires something of a ‘Trinitarian structure’ in us. As a result, grace cannot be reduced either to a merely logical relation between the one God and the creature or to a created ‘quality’ of sanctifying nature whose only connection with </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God’ is a bond of causal dependence. As in Pauline theology, the interior sanctification of the human being is first and foremost the communication of the personal Spirit of God, or, in scholastic language, the  <i class="calibre4">donum increatum</i>, in such a way that any existence under and in the Spirit ( <i class="calibre4">pneumatikos</i>) appears as the consequence or effect of the possession of this uncreated grace. It is because we have the personal  <i class="calibre4">Pneuma</i> of God that we have our spiritual existence. Otherwise put, the doctrine of grace should insist less on the created aspect of grace than on what grace is and actually produces, namely the self-communication of God in Christ and the Spirit. In 1959, Karl Rahner wrote in  <i class="calibre4">Lexikon für Theologie</i> <i class="calibre4">und Kirche</i> a piece titled ‘Dreifaltigkeitsmystik’. It sums up the historical, doctrinal, and systematic developments of the  <i class="calibre4">Lexikon</i>, so as to indicate the fundamental direction in Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> which the Trinitarian theology of indwelling should be oriented and developed, based on an economic understanding of the Trinitarian faith culminating in the sanctifying gift of the Spirit. Through reform of the theology of grace, Rahner arrives at the articulation of the fundamental axiom that contains the essence of his Trinitarian doctrine. Before Rahner wrote any systematic text on the Trinity, the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 320) </b>axiom that the Trinity of the economy of salvation is the immanent Trinity was treated in similar formulations, beginning in 1939 with the very scholarly study of the scholastic notion of uncreated grace in <i class="calibre4">Zeitschrift für katholische Theologie</i> (Rahner 1939), then in 1949 with the work of biblical theology devoted to ‘Theos in the New Testament’ (Rahner 1954b). The contested question can be formulated as follows: is God's indwelling in the righteous only ‘appropriated’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the divine persons, or does grace give the sanctified human being a proper and distinctive relation to them? If one answers that such a union is given to the human by the mediation of  <i class="calibre4">created</i> grace, then one must apply the principle of the Trinity's unity of efficient causality in creation, without consideration of the distinction of the divine persons. Pius XII refined this principle by stating: ‘Omnia esse habenda Sanctissimae Trinitati communia, quatenus eadem Deum ut supremam efficientem causam respiciant’ (‘all these activities are common to the most Blessed Trinity, in so far as they have God as supreme efficient cause’: Pius XII,  <i class="calibre4">Mystici Corporis</i>, 1943, no. 78). So it was specifically in 1939 that Rahner gave his first sketch of the axiom which would only be definitively formulated in 1960 and 1967 in two other important texts:</p>
<p class="calibre1">There can be absolutely no objection to maintaining on the basis of the positive data of Revelation that the attribution of determinate relations of the recipient of grace is not merely a matter of appropriation, but is intended to give expression to a proper relationship in each case ( <i class="calibre4">ein je eigentümliches Verhältnis</i>). In Scripture it is the Father in the Trinity who is our Father, and not the threefold God ( <i class="calibre4">Der</i> <i class="calibre4">Vater in der Trinität ist in der Schrift unser Vater, nicht der dreifaltige Gott</i>). (Rahner 1954a: 374; 1961a: 345) The fundamental axiom has as yet to find its full and formally definitive formulation. But it is broadly adumbrated in the innovative and vigorous developments which he devotes to the theology of grace, given interiorly as the most gratuitous and intimate gift. Rahner shows himself to be fully conscious that the theology of grace and Trinitarian theology are mutually dependent. The reduction of the economic Trinity to a kind of ‘pre-Christian monotheism’ ( <i class="calibre4">vorchristlichen Monotheismus</i>) does not seem to be curbed or corrected by the doctrine of the appropriations, but rather reinforced. It is therefore fitting, in light of the positive givens of faith, to expose the  <i class="calibre4">proper</i> relations which each of the divine persons has with the regenerated and saved human person. The balance sought by the theologian consists, in this period, in articulating in an organic manner the ‘Trinity of the economy’ and the ‘inner Trinity’ ( <i class="calibre4">innere Trinität</i>). But in 1939, contrary to later texts, the balance that Rahner seeks between the ‘inner Trinity’ and the ‘Trinity of the economy’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">still remains prisoner of a question debated in scholastic theology and oriented by the necessity of not infringing on the principle of the unity of the efficient causality of God the Trinity in his operation  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>. Rahner thus seeks to set up the principle of a relationship of the graced human being to the Triune God that would not just be an ‘appropriat</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> ed’ relation. Progressively, and guided by the renewal of biblical study, Rahner shifts his Trinitarian doctrine's centre of gravity toward the Greek schema for which the Father is the Person-source of the divine life and the principle of Trinitarian consubstantiality. However, this preference does not consist in adopting the characteristic features of the Cappadocian Greek theology. Rather, it aims at averting  <b class="calibre3">(p. 321) </b>the ever-present danger of appearing ‘tritheist’. In foregrounding the hypostasis of the Father, Rahner presents the Logos and the Spirit as the two internal and mutually opposed elements of the undivided communication through which the  <i class="calibre4">Father</i> is given to the world without intermediary. It is through the missions of the Son and Spirit that Rahner comes back to the ‘immanent’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinity, by positing the principle that the differentiation which the economy of salvation reveals to us must be found in God himself. Such a relationship could not have an arbitrary foundation. The Incarnation of the only Logos and the mission of the Spirit are not just simple matters of fact. They must be really involved as the internal and mutually opposed elements of the undivided communication by which the Father gives himself to the world. This representation of the Trinity highlights the hypostasis of the Father and interprets the Trinitarian life as an absolute subjectivity, identified with the Father. This is proven by Rahner's qualifying the mode of the intra-Trinitarian processions by reference to the Father as the source. The reality of the distinction between the Trinitarian ‘hypostases’ is founded on the dual self-communication which the  <i class="calibre4">Father</i> makes, in so far as he is the One who ‘expresses’ and the One who ‘receives’. The Father establishes a real distinction between himself, and the personal expression he gives of himself, and the gift which is received. One basic text enables us to authenticate our interpretation of Rahner: Here God is the ‘Father’, that is, the simply unoriginate God, who is always known as presupposed, who communicates  <i class="calibre4">himself</i> precisely when and because his self-communication does not simply coincide with him in lifeless identity. In this self-communication, he stays the one who is free, incomprehensible—in a word, unoriginate. (Rahner 1967: 371; 1970: 84) The Rahnerian model is neither Greek nor Latin. Rahner never in any way adopts the position that that the Trinitarian persons are distinguished by incommunicable properties or idioms. Nor does he take up the principle that the distinction between the persons rests on relative opposition. Certainly, he does not deny that the relationship ( <i class="calibre4">Beziehung</i>) between the One who communicates himself and those who, respectively, are expressed (the Son) and received (the Spirit) in this communication must be understood as a relationship between ‘relations’. But Rahner explicitly rules out using the notion of relative opposition to overcome the antinomy between hypostatic diversity and essential unity. Since relation is precisely that which distinguishes the least ( <i class="calibre4">ens debilissimum</i>), it serves to mitigate the <i class="calibre4">crux interpretum</i> of Trinitarian faith, culminating in the affirmation of the irreducible and relational reality of the divine persons that the Trinitarian economy reveals. Rahner himself, however, is reluctant to foreground the distinct hypostasis, above all if doing so tends surreptitiously to confuse the hypostasis with the phenomenological conception of the notion of ‘person’. The clearest text we have to account for the reality of the intra-Trinitarian persons hardly goes beyond the formulation Rahner gives in his 1967 treatise: Page 8 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> There is real difference in God as he is in himself between one and the same God insofar as he is—at once and necessarily—the unoriginate who mediates himself to himself (Father), the one who is in truth uttered for himself (Son), and the one <b class="calibre3">(p. 322) </b>who is received and accepted in love for himself (Spirit)—and insofar as,  <i class="calibre4">as</i> <i class="calibre4">a</i>  <i class="calibre4">result of this</i>, he is the one who can freely communicate himself. (Rahner 1967: 384; 1970: 102)</p>
<p class="calibre1">On all of these points, Rahner's Trinitarian theology does not offer a fixed position. If, on the one hand, he seems to foreground the hypostasis of the Father, on the other hand, he is critical of the common use of the concept of ‘person’, seen as loaded with ambiguity when it is taken in the phenomenological sense of a free self-consciousness, the source of reflective acts and spiritual autonomy. Liberating our faith from ‘mythological’ representations of the Trinity demands that we free ourselves from the projection onto God of phenomenological conceptions of the person. One should keep to propositions that do not go beyond the more ‘metaphysical’ vocabulary of ‘Principle’, ‘truth’, and ‘love’. In other words, known and grasped as the Being-source who expresses himself and gives himself in a dual communication which is concretized in the economy of salvation, the divine Trinity cannot be seduced or reduced to a nascent form of ‘modalism’. The logic of the gift which directs Rahner's Trinitarian theology requires that the dual communication through which God gives himself to us in the Incarnation of the Logos and the gift of the Spirit is anchored in God's very being. Thus, the Father, Son, and Spirit are, simultaneously, under the perspective of their mutual and constitutive relationships, the ‘distinct modes of subsisting’ ( <i class="calibre4">distinkte Subsistenzweisen</i>) of the one, single divine essence. But it is clear that Rahner primarily envisages the divine essence as ‘realized’ in the first concrete mode of subsisting which is the Father, in which it is concretized and personalizes itself as source. Thus, the dominant model of this Trinitarian theology can be expressed by speaking of the  <i class="calibre4">divine self-communication of the Father</i>, the source of his communication  <i class="calibre4">ad intra</i> in the two distinct modes of subsistence and the foundation of his communication  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> in the Incarnation of the Logos and the gift of the Spirit. It is also fitting that the creation be understood as a moment of this divine self-communication of the Father which is realized in a prototypical manner in the eternal Trinitarian life. This is why Rahner sets up a correlation between the Trinitarian offer of divine life and the ‘Trinitarian structure of the mind’. This final articulation, of anthropo-theological nature, results from the principles of transcendental anthropology developed by Rahner in his philosophy of religion. We cannot give a complete exposition of this transcendental anthropology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To grasp its meaning and Trinitarian implications, one can use the formulation that Rahner gave in one of his best- known works,  <i class="calibre4">Hearer of the Word</i>, which published his lectures given in 1937 at Salzburg:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We are at the heart of authentic philosophy of religion to the extent that it becomes for us the foundation of the possibility of a revelation of God. If revelation must be the unfolding ( <i class="calibre4">Enthüllung</i>) of the Absolute itself to the finite mind, it requires two conditions: on the one hand, that every being can express itself in a true word ( <i class="calibre4">wahre Rede</i>), in a communication ( <i class="calibre4">Mitteilung</i>) which is addressed to the mind. It is only on this condition that the possibility of the communication of a Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> reality ( <i class="calibre4">Sachverhalt</i>), hidden in God, can be admitted, and it is this which we mean by the term revelation ( <i class="calibre4">Offenbarung</i>)…. On the other hand, the ultimate unity of being and knowledge is the final presupposition of God in his divinity communicating to man by the word ( <i class="calibre4">die Rede</i>) and through the Word ( <i class="calibre4">das Wort</i>). It is only if the existence of the entity is at  <b class="calibre3">(p. 323) </b>once ‘Logos’ that the Logos become flesh can say in ‘Speech’ all that is hidden in the depths of divinity’. (Rahner 1963: 70) It is in this perspective that Rahner's Trinitarian theology shows its complexity and the breadth of its implications. In the final analysis, as we emphasized at the outset, his Trinitarian theology is integrated with the guiding question that unites all of his theological thought. His Trinitarian doctrine is, as it were, a fundamental variation on the single theme of the free revelation of God addressed to a humanity which is capable of receiving it. Hence, the self-communication of God will be realized in unity and in distinction, under the ‘mode’ of history (Truth) and the Spirit (love), knowledge and love being understood as the realization, on the human level, of  <i class="calibre4">verum</i> and of  <i class="calibre4">bonum</i>, that is, as anthropological transcendental determinations. Rather than calling this a Trinitarian doctrine as such, it is better to speak of the event of self-communication by which God, in manifesting himself at the heart of the spiritual consciousness, manifests himself as Being who is self-differentiated in an act of pure interior donation and of which the Father is the source and the goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Major Directions in Contemporary Catholic </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary Catholic Trinitarian theology cannot be summed up in the two great figures of Hans Urs von Balthasar and Karl Rahner, although they profoundly influenced the whole development and renewal of Trinitarian doctrine in the Catholic context. One cannot appreciate the phenomenon of twentieth-century Catholic Trinitarian theology without taking account of the factors that contributed to its substantial renewal. It is undeniable that the primary factor was the renewal of positive theology, freed from the accustomed forms in which the outdated language and conceptuality of scholastic theology had bound it. Positive theology took the form of a historical theology that placed in diachronic perspective the developments of Trinitarian theology in the tradition, without automatically considering earlier formulations as unsatisfactory by comparison with later developments of the tradition. Inspired by the work of Théodore de Régnon in his  <i class="calibre4">Études de</i> <i class="calibre4">théologie positive sur la Sainte Trinité</i> (4 vols., Paris: Victor Retaux, 1892–98), the theology of the first decades of the twentieth century was on the path toward a Trinitarian renewal. In its beginnings it owed everything to ‘historical theology’ and to its methods of investigation, because ‘historical theology’ was the other word that identified and transformed, during the years 1910–20, the narrowness of positive theology. The appearance in 1910 of Jules Lebreton's  <i class="calibre4">Histoire du dogme de la Trinité</i> (2 vols., 1910 and 1927) marked a turning point for positive theology. (Among other works of historical theology, a special mention is also due to Hans Joachim Schoeps, who held the chair of history of reli</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> gions and of thought at Erlangen University:  <i class="calibre4">Theologie und Geschichte des</i>  <b class="calibre3">(p. 324) </b>  <i class="calibre4">Judenchristentums</i>, Tübingen: J. C. B. Mohr/Paul Siebeck, 1949.) It was no longer the condensed doctrinal substance of the faith reduced to its driest explication, but a  <i class="calibre4">history</i> of the doctrinal formation and objectification of Christian faith. This history neglects no period that is involved in the formation of reflective faith. Jules Lebreton clearly establishes the moments that, in this long history, are to be considered as  <i class="calibre4">progress</i> in the understanding of the faith received from the Apostles and set down in the inspired Scriptures. He also sketches the beginnings of a renewal that restores to the Trinity its rootedness in the baptismal and ecclesial life of the Christian: ‘This intense sociality is a crucial safeguard for Christianity: the Christian does not pursue private speculations; his faith is the faith of the Church; the symbol to which he subscribes at baptism is his rule of faith’ (Lebreton 1928: xiii). Today one can smile at the naϯveté with which Lebreton interpreted the theology of the great ante-Nicene theologians, the apologists of the second century in particular. He judges that their thought is fraught with gaucheries, ambiguities, or even errors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they are excusable to the eyes of the historian of dogma who knows, retroactively, that they are steps on the way to more satisfying developments. We can no longer make precisely the same judgement, nor can we regard in the same way the theology of Justin Martyr, or of Theophilus of Antioch or Athenagoras, or more later of Hippolytus and Tertullian. One would certainly shrink from their near alignment of the generation of the Logos with the production of the world, but one can also detect here the speculative expression of a  <i class="calibre4">Christian</i> and  <i class="calibre4">Trinitarian</i> theology of creation, which, following the Pauline hymns in Ephesians and Colossians, takes Christ to be the ‘firstborn of all creation’, a creation on its way to filiation. The high medieval tradition did not denigrate this Trinitarian reading of creation. It is today one of the masterpieces of contemporary Trinitarian theology, as the work of von Balthasar attests, in the last stage of his theological trilogy: ‘The more Trinitarian (which is to say, the richer) our picture of God is ( <i class="calibre4">Je trinitarisch-reicher</i> <i class="calibre4">unser Gottesbild ist</i>), the more we are able to have a positive attitude to the eternal perfecting of the world created and redeemed in God’ (von Balthasar 1983: 463; 1998: 506). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relationship between Trinity and creation, Trinity and ontology is one of the paths that contemporary Catholic theology has taken fruitfully, thanks to a re-reading of the high medieval tradition and to new speculative resources, as shown in an emblematic way by the brief and innovative work of Klaus Hemmerle,  <i class="calibre4">Thesen zu einer trinitarischen Ontologie</i> (1976). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relationship between Trinity and creation, which has given rise to eminent studies leading to new interpretations of the Tradition, is characterized by a mutual fertilization between the great texts of medieval theology and the renewal of the theology of creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One should indicate here the magisterial work of Gilles Emery, and the earlier, three-volume work of Louis Bouyer, devoted respectively to the  <i class="calibre4">Eternal Son</i>, the  <i class="calibre4">Invisible Father</i>, and the  <i class="calibre4">Consoler</i> ( <i class="calibre4">Le Fils éternel, Le Père invisible</i>, and  <i class="calibre4">Le Consolateur</i>, Paris: Cerf, 1973 </p>
<p class="calibre1">to 1980). This trilogy is one of the most accomplished works of contemporary Catholic Trinitarian theology, which indirectly inspired the work of François-Xavier Durrwell about the relation of Christ to the Spirit, and about the Father. These two major works would never have been produced without the erudite studies of Yves-Marie Congar and the Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a><b class="calibre3">Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Twentieth-Century Catholic Currents on the Trinity</b> project of pneumatological Christology which he ceaselessly reworked  <b class="calibre3">(p. 325) </b>and refined, as can be seen from his many articles on the relation of the Spirit to Christ in the <i class="calibre4">Revue des sciences philosophiques et théologiques</i>. One of the most notable features of modern Catholic Trinitarian theology has been its openness to the reappropriation of the heritage of Byzantine theology, and of the specific form of its pneumatology. The leading protagonist here was Yves-Marie Congar with his three vast volumes explicitly devoted to the Holy Spirit (Congar 1979–80). Byzantine theology contributed something to the possible future reform of the Latin understanding of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, but far more to the conception of the form which the Triune  <i class="calibre4">unity</i> takes.  <i class="calibre4">Communion</i> models of the Triune unity have advanced step by step, tied to a form of personalism intended to correct the narrowness of the dominant model drawn from the Augustinian analogy of the ‘Trinitarian cogito’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary theologians often detect in the Augustinian model a possible reduction of the Trinitarian mystery to solipsism, treating the Trinitarian life as a kind of supra-subjectivity. These ‘communion’ models, locating the principle of the unity of nature in the notion of circumincession or perichoresis, try to go beyond the aporias of Rahnerian theology, which reduces the Trinitarian life to its paternal source, conceived as a supra-subjectivity. The erudite and systematic writings of Gisbert Greshake are authoritative in this field (Greshake 1997). This is also the direction of the works of the Spanish theologian Xabier Pikaza, especially his  <i class="calibre4">Dios como Espíritu y Persona</i> (Pikaza 1989). The progressive and at times unilateral use of ‘communion’ models to think about the intra-Trinitarian relation finds an equally systematic expression in the work of the North American theologian Catherine Mowry LaCugna, which has been received as among the most stimulating theological works of the past few decades (LaCugna 1992). With regard to the status of the notion of person and debates about its relative equivocity, theologians will seek a  <i class="calibre4">via</i> <i class="calibre4">media</i> by returning to the interpersonal analogy, along with the metaphysical correctives necessary to avoid anthropomorphism. It is a difficult tight-rope to walk, but scholarly and forward-looking syntheses have achieved it, as in the work of Walter Kasper cited above. But it is above all in the ecclesiological domain that Catholic Trinitarian doctrine finds one of its happiest topics, as can already be seen in Michael Schmaus's  <i class="calibre4">Dogmatik</i> (1953 to 1955). The Trinitarian motif appears beginning in 1937 in the first work of Yves-Marie Congar,  <i class="calibre4">Chrétiens désunis: Principes d’un oecuménisme catholique</i>, which came out in the  <i class="calibre4">Unam Sanctam</i> series:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The unity of the Church is an expression and an extension of the unity of God himself. The life which is eternally in the bosom of the Father, after communicating itself within God so as to make up the ‘divine society’ of the Three persons of the blessed Trinity, is graciously communicated to spiritual creatures, first to the angels and then to us. This is the Church: the extension of the divine life to a multiplicity of creatures. (Congar 1937: 59) The Church is here situated in the framework of the economy of salvation: she proceeds from the Trinity and returns to it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article explores contemporary Orthodox Trinitarian theology, highlighting the influence of Sergius Bulgakov, Vladimir Lossky and John Zizioulas. It explains that Bulgakov conceived the Trinity in terms of the actualization, in the Holy Spirit, of the self-revelation of the Father in the Son in which process the tri-hypostatic being of God was revealed as Sophia in eternal communion with humanity. Lossky held that the Trinity was revealed in the Incarnation of Christ, an antinomic truth that requires an apophatic and mystical theology. Zizioulas adopted Lossky's emphasis on the monarchy of the Father and on personhood as freedom from the limitations of nature, but distanced himself from Lossky's apophaticism and neo-Palamite commitment to the essence/energies distinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Orthodox Trinitarian theology, Sergius Bulgakov, Vladimir Lossky, John Zizioulas, self-revelation, Holy Spirit, Father, Incarnation of Christ, antinomic truth, apophaticism FOR contemporary Orthodox theology of the Trinity, the fourth century was clearly a definitive moment. It was then that Athanasius of Alexandria, more than any other theologian in the history of Christian thought up to that time, unequivocally declared the full divinity of the Son. The explicit declaration of the divinity of the Holy Spirit soon followed with the Cappadocian Fathers, especially Gregory of Nazianzus. Contemporary Orthodox theology stands within this tradition of thinking on God as Trinity in one significant way: it continues to interpret the doctrine of the Trinity as the Christian affirmation of a God whose being is love and freedom to be in communion with the not-God. The link between the doctrine of the Trinity and the affirmation of divine–human communion stands at the core of the three major trajectories in contemporary Orthodox theology: the sophiology of Sergii Bulgakov, the apophaticism of Vladimir Lossky, and the relational ontology of John Zizioulas. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> <b class="calibre3">Sophia! Orthoi! </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The key to understanding Sergii Bulgakov's (1871–1945) Trinitarian theology is to decipher (literally) what he means by ‘Sophia’, which has been the chief stumbling-block to appreciating Bulgakov's work. The question that must be posed to Bulgakov is the following: Why is the concept of Sophia necessary for Trinitarian theology? </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the surface, Bulgakov's Trinitarian theology seems quite ordinary. First, he accepts the categories of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> and  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> that were hammered out during the Trinitarian controversies of the fourth century. Second, he gives an Augustine-inspired interpretation of the Trinity as the Father's self-revelation in the Son, with the Holy Spirit being the love that unites the Father and the Son, and, as such, completes the self-revelation of the Father in the Son. The Cappadocians and Augustine made significant contributions  <b class="calibre3">(p. 329)</b> toward a theology of the Trinity, but they failed to elaborate further on the implications of the  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>, which was necessary in order to account for conceptualizing the God-world relation in terms of communion. In both the Latin and the Greek forms of Trinitarian theology, the  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> was interpreted in terms of the attributes common to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and as that which constituted the unity of the Godhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Bulgakov does not necessarily dispute these understandings of the  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>, they do not fully account for the God-world relation. It is, therefore, a particular understanding of the God-world relation in terms of communion that leads Bulgakov to claim that a further theological unpacking of the  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> is needed (Bulgakov 1993: 25). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The key to understanding the link between  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> and Sophia in Bulgakov lies in his notion of the self-revelation of God. The relation between the Father and the Son is the self-revelation of the Father in the Son. This self-revelation, however, is only complete in the Holy Spirit, who unites the Father and the Son. Bulgakov identifies the Father as ‘Divine Depth and Mystery, the Divine Subject of self-revelation’ (Bulgakov 2004: 359–93). If one were to bracket the self-revelation of God in the Son and in the Spirit, the Father is, then, the Absolute, which cannot even be called God, since the latter is a relative term. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This Absolute is an unknowable, impenetrable mystery. It is in the self-revelation of the Father in the Son that the Father transcends this transcendence, or reveals his transcendence as immanence, and is immanent as revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Son, therefore, is the Image of the Father, the Word of the Father in which is contained all words; the ‘objective self-revelation’ (Bulgakov 1993: 43) of the Father, the Truth of the Father, and, as such, the divine content (Bulgakov 2008: 111). Bracketing now the person of the Holy Spirit, the Father knows the Son as the Image of the Father, and the Son knows the Father as that of which he is the perfect image. The relationship is one of mutual mirroring, but this mirroring is not yet the accomplished self-revelation of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such a revelation is not a self-revelation unless it is actualized, and this actualization is accomplished in the person of the Holy Spirit, who is the love that unites the Father and the Son: the Father loves all that is revealed in the Son, and the Son returns this love Page 2 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> kenotically as the hypostatic image of the Father (Bulgakov 2004: 63). According to Bulgakov, the self-revelation of the Father is not complete until the content that is revealed in the Son is actualized as life by the Holy Spirit. In this sense, the Holy Spirit, for Bulgakov, is the ‘spirit of truth’ and ‘represents the principle of reality. He transforms the world of ideas into a living and real essence’ (Bulgakov 1993: 48–9). The Trinity is thus the self-revelation of God to Godself, specifically, the self-revelation of the Father mediated through Godself, the revealing hypostases of the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Word and the Glory of God, respectively. In what is a striking affinity with the Karl Barth of volume I, part I of the  <i class="calibre4">Church Dogmatics</i>, Bulgakov identifies the Father as the revealing hypostasis, the Son as the revealed hypostasis, and the Holy Spirit as the revelation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where does Sophia fit into all this? In the end, Sophia is identified in Bulgakov's system with the  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> of God hypostatized in the trihypostatic self-revelation of God; but, as such, it is no longer simply  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>. Bracketing the self-revelation of the Father in the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 330) </b>Son and the Spirit, Bulgakov argues that the Father remains ‘in himself undisclosed’; as undisclosed, he adds that ‘Sophia so far as the hypostasis of the Father is concerned, connotes predominantly Ousia—prior to its own revelation as Sophia’ (Bulgakov 1993: 41). It is only in the self-revelation of God in the Son and the Holy Spirit that all that God  <i class="calibre4">is</i> is revealed, only in this self-revelation that all that God is  <i class="calibre4">is</i>; there is an identification in Bulgakov between the self-revelation of God and the fullness of God's existence. In this fullness of God's existence,  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> is no longer an apophatic concept indicative of impenetrable mystery and transcendence of the Absolute;  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> is Sophia. Sophia, then, for Bulgakov, is God's being as the self-revelation of the Father in the Son and the Holy Spirit. As Bulgakov states, ‘Sophia is Ousia as revealed’ (Bulgakov 1993: 54), or ‘Sophia is the revelation of the Son and the Holy Spirit, without separation and without confusion’ (Bulgakov 2004: 189), or ‘Divine Sophia is God's  <i class="calibre4">exhaustive</i> self-revelation, the fullness of divinity, and therefore has absolute content’ (Bulgakov 2002: 39). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the very being of God it must necessarily, Bulgakov argues, refer to God's relation to the world, and not simply to the intra-Trinitarian relations, because, for Bulgakov, the self-revelation of God in the Logos and the Holy Spirit is the revelation of all that God is, and included in all that God  <i class="calibre4">is</i> is God's relation to creation and humanity. Bulgakov is not arguing for the eternity of a creation that is restricted by time and space. If, however, all theology is grounded in the premise that God has revealed Godself as Creator and Redeemer, it is impossible for Bulgakov to conceive the thinking of God that does not include God existing as eternally relating to creation in some way. Accordingly, God's self-revelation as the revelation of all that God  <i class="calibre4">is</i> is also God's being as love, and thus, as freedom to create and redeem what is not God, and, thus, as eternally relating to creation. It is for this reason that Bulgakov identifies Sophia with ‘the divine world’ and links Sophia with that famous Russian theological term  <i class="calibre4">sobornost</i>; Sophia is the ‘cosmic  <i class="calibre4">sobornost</i> of concrete all-unity in divine love’ (Bulgakov 2008: 103–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the all-unity, Sophia is also identified with another famous Russian theological term, <i class="calibre4">bogochelovechestvo</i>, which is untranslatable, but has been rendered as God-manhood, the humanity of God, or divine–humanity. The term originates with Vladimir Sergeevich Page 3 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> Solov’ev (1853–1900), considered the father of Russian sophiology, whose influence on Bulgakov is without dispute (Valliere 2000).  <i class="calibre4">Bogochelovechestvo</i> signifies in a more concrete way that God's being as Trinitarian is always-already an eternal communion with humanity; and this always-already eternal communion with humanity becomes the foundation for God's creation of the  <i class="calibre4">anthropos</i> as the image of God, and of the incarnation of the Logos in Jesus. Creation in time and space is essentially a repetition of the being of God, which includes the self-revelation of the Father in the Son through the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgakov distinguishes between the divine Sophia and the creaturely Sophia, with the divine Sophia being the foundation for the becoming of the world in time and space. As the soul of the world in time and space, it is the creaturely Sophia, the power of the world in its becoming toward union with the divine Sophia, which is divinization for Bulgakov—the unity of the divine and creaturely Sophia. Even though Sophia is about God's relation to the world, it is identified with  <i class="calibre4">bogochelovechestvo</i> for Bulgakov, because it is in and through humanity that world is divinizable (Bulgakov 1993: 14). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 331) </b>The notion of self-revelation of God is integral to Bulgakov's Trinitarian theology, and it is here that one sees the influence of German Idealism, although it should be made clear that Bulgakov was critical of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, especially what he saw as making creation constitutive of the being of God. The self-revelation of God gives an account of why three in God. He faults both Latin and Greek Christian thinkers for not engaging in a ‘theological deduction of the Trinitarian dogma’, which means that ‘[t]he ontological necessity of precisely three, as a trinity, is not shown and not proved’ (Bulgakov 2004: 33). Bulgakov adds that ‘the trinity in Divinity in unity, as well as in the distinction of the three concrete hypostases, must be shown not only as a divinely revealed  <i class="calibre4">fact</i>, valid by virtue of its facticity, but also as a  <i class="calibre4">principle</i> owing to which Divinity is not a dyad, tetrad, etc., in general not a pagan Olympus, but precisely a trinity, exhausting itself in its fullness and self-enclosedness’ (Bulgakov 2004: 7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The proper way for thought to fathom this revealed fact is to begin with the assumption that God is Spirit; and it is here that one sees the more positive appropriation of German Idealism by Bulgakov. According to Bulgakov, ‘[i]t is proper to spirit to have a personal consciousness, a hypostasis, and a nature as its self-revelation, and the life of spirit consists in the living out of this personal self-revelation in its nature. In spirit are given: I, as personal self-consciousness; nature, as the source of its self-revelation; and revelation itself as the life of the spirit in its nature’ (Bulgakov 2004: 61). If the logic of this phenomenology of spirit as personal self-consciousness is self-evident in the created realm, then it must also apply to God, who is Absolute Spirit. Since there are no limits or givens in God, there is no I in opposition to the not-I, as with created spirit; God is for Godself ‘simultaneously I, thou, he, and therefore we and you’ (Bulgakov 2004: 54). God's Trinitarian being as self-revelation is a perfect communion of persons who, in their three distinct subjectivities, are one subject. In the notion of the dynamism of the ‘I’ toward the other, Bulgakov was clearly influenced by Pavel Florensky, whose stamp is also evident in the Trinitarian theology of the well-known Romanian theologian, Dumitru Staniloae (Florensky 1997; Staniloae 1998). The communion of persons of the Trinity is thus the self-revelation of the Absolute, which is the Father, and this communion/self-revelation is a kenotic event Page 4 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> in so far as it is constituted by the mutual  <i class="calibre4">kenosis</i> of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Bulgakov 2004: 179–80, 384). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it is no doubt questionable whether German Idealist notions of the self can be appropriated in Trinitarian theology, especially given postmodern criticism and modifications of Idealist notions of the self, the problems with Bulgakov's so-called ‘Trinitarian deduction’ do not necessarily lead to the jettisoning of his sophiology. What Bulgakov saw most clearly was that the Christian conceptualization of God as Trinity was motivated not simply by a particular understanding of salvation, but was ultimately an attempt to account for how God  <i class="calibre4">is</i> in such a way so as to be in communion with what is not-God, which is the real point of the Trinity. Bulgakov also saw clearly that, although much important work was done by Greek and Latin Christian thinkers, the categories of  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> and  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> could not, by themselves, do the work of conceptualizing God's being as one of communion with the not-God. Bulgakov introduces a third term, ‘Sophia’, which he considers an amplification of  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>, to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 332) </b>account for God's Trinitarian being as communion with the not-God, but he does so in a way that avoids the pitfalls of social Trinitarianism. One could argue that Bulgakov's Sophia has affinities with the Thomistic notion of  <i class="calibre4">esse</i>. Bulgakov might argue, however, that  <i class="calibre4">esse</i>, because arrived at philosophically, can only ground an analogy of being that makes a certain kind of knowledge possible, but not knowledge as communion. In terms of the analogy of being, Bulgakov is closer to Balthasar in attempting to conceptualize a Trinitarian understanding of being that would allow for communion. The real relevance and challenge of Bulgakov's notion of Sophia consists in how to think of the immanent Trinity in such a way that accounts for God's being as communion with the world, but does so without falling into the inevitable problems of social Trinitarianism. Bulgakov's single, retrievable insight is that a third term is needed, and this third term has something to do with Sophia. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">An Apophatic Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Vladimir Lossky (1903–58) was also a Russian émigré to Paris, but his theology was self-consciously developed in opposition to that of Bulgakov. Their differences notwithstanding, both theologians saw the doctrine of the Trinity as rooted in the Orthodox axiom of divine–human communion. While Bulgakov understood theology's task as developing the ontological implications of the Orthodox affirmation of divine–human union in Christ, Lossky would argue, beginning with his early work on Dionysius the Areopagite, that the affirmation of divine–human communion demanded an apophatic approach to theology. In addition to Bulgakov, Lossky's other sparring partner, which he shared with the Catholic <i class="calibre4">nouvelle théologie</i> movement, was neo-scholasticism, which was not reticent in criticizing Gregory Palamas's understanding of the essence/energies distinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Lossky, the Christian belief in God as Trinity is a fact revealed in the Incarnation of Christ, in whose person the divine and human natures are unified. In so far as this divine–</p>
<p class="calibre1">human communion is a paradoxical union of two distinct ontological realities, the uncreated and the created, the uniting of Godself to humanity in the person of Jesus is a truth Page 5 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> that reason is unable to prove or understand once given as a fact of revelation. The Incarnation is an antinomic truth, by which Lossky means the simultaneous affirmation of statements that are opposite or contradictory, the ‘non-opposition of opposites’, the opposition ‘of contrary but equally true propositions’. Given his emphasis on antinomy, it is not quite accurate to accuse Lossky, as Michel René Barnes does, of appropriating uncritically Théodore de Régnon's interpretation that ‘Latin philosophy envisages first the nature in itself and then proceeds to the expression; Greek philosophy envisages first the expression and then penetrates it to find the nature’ (Lossky 1974: 26, 51; for a fuller response to Barnes, see Papanikolaou 2006: 181). In revealing the truth of God and the God-world relation as antinomic, the Incarnation demands an apophatic approach to theology. As Lossky puts it, ‘[t]he existence of an apophatic attitude … is  <b class="calibre3">(p. 333) </b>implied in the paradox of the Christian revelation’ (Lossky 1974: 15). Apophaticism, for Lossky, is in one sense an understanding of the truth of God as lying beyond human reason. As we shall see more clearly below, it is not simply a necessary negation of positive statements about God en route to a more analogical naming of God. Apophaticism is equivalent to an ascetical exercise that is necessary if one wants to ascend to a true knowledge of God—the mystical knowledge of unknowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another antinomy revealed in the Incarnation is God's being as Trinity. In approaching the Christian belief in God as Trinity, theology's task is to find the appropriate categories that would preserve the antinomy of God's unity-in-distinction. There is a strict divide, according to Lossky, between  <i class="calibre4">oikonomia</i> and  <i class="calibre4">theologia</i>, between the economic and the immanent Trinity, and although we can assert that God is Trinity based on God's economy, we cannot engage in further speculation on God's being  <i class="calibre4">in se</i>. In fact, in order to affirm God's Trinitarian being as unity-in-distinction, it is necessary for theology to engage in an apophatic negation of the properties attributed to the persons of the Trinity manifested in the economy. According to Lossky, ‘what will subsist beyond all negating or positing, is the notion of the absolute hypostatic difference and of the equally absolute essential identity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit’ (Lossky 1974: 16). The antinomic categories used to express the doctrine of the Trinity were nature ( <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>) and person ( <i class="calibre4">hypostasis/prosopon</i>). Once deconceptualized,  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> indicates what is common in God, while <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> indicates the irreducibility of the three persons. The genius of the Fathers lay in using synonymous words to express the Trinitarian antinomy, thus allowing for the one side of the antinomy, God's unity, always to refer to the irreducibility of the hypostases, and vice versa (Lossky 1976: 51). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lossky, however, transgresses his own apophatic restrictions on the categories of  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> and  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> in his development of a more positive theology of personhood that is grounded in the theology of the Trinity. Personhood entails two constitutive aspects, for Lossky: irreducibility ( <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>) and freedom ( <i class="calibre4">ekstasis</i>). A person is irreducible in the sense of not being identified with the common nature, by being irrevocably particular and irreplaceable. A person is free not in the sense of freedom of choice;  <i class="calibre4">ekstatic</i> freedom, for Lossky, is freedom from the necessity of nature. Human personhood is an  <i class="calibre4">ekstatic</i> freedom from the limitations and finitude inherent in created nature that can only be given in mystical union with the uncreated. Lossky grounds this notion of  <i class="calibre4">ekstasis</i> in the pa</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> tristic notion of the monarchy of the Father. He argues that the monarchy of the Father is necessary for the doctrine of the Trinity in order to maintain the antinomy of the unity-indistinction, since it ‘maintains the perfect equilibrium between the nature and the persons, without coming down too heavily on either side…. The one nature and the three hypostases are presented simultaneously to our understanding, with neither prior to the other’ (Lossky 1974: 81). The monarchy of the Father also indicates, for Lossky, that the hypostasis of the Father cannot be reduced to God's nature, and this irreducibility  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the Father's freedom to ‘cause’ the Son and the Spirit, to give the divine  <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> to the Son and the Spirit (Lossky 1978: 46–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The monarchy of the Father also guards against the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, the assertion that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father  <i class="calibre4">and the Son</i>. Lossky was (in)famous for his virulent <b class="calibre3">(p. 334) </b>critique of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, claiming that ‘by the dogma of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, the God of the philosophers and savants is introduced into the heart of the Living God’ (Lossky 1974: 88). Although this statement sounds excessive, Lossky viewed the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> as the result of a neo-scholastic method that he deemed as itself excessively rationalistic. In its understanding of truth as propositional, from which the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> ultimately derives its justification, Lossky saw neo-scholasticism as undermining the apophatic notion of knowledge of God as mystical union, and thus the Christian affirmation of divine–human communion in Christ. There was, consequently, a practical concern driving Lossky's rejection of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, together with the theological method from which it resulted. For Lossky, theology is necessarily apophatic, and hence, antinomic, so that the human person could never rest complacent in her ascetic ascent toward God. One could say that theology as antinomy exists as an ascetical exercise, allowing for the proper expression of dogma to guide the human ascent toward God, and not allowing anyone to think that this movement toward knowledge of God is ever complete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the most widely read Orthodox theologian in the latter half of the twentieth century among Orthodox and non-Orthodox alike, Lossky was responsible for popularizing the essence/energies distinction, which became almost synonymous with Orthodox theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The essence/energies distinction is an antinomic expression for God's transcendence and immanence. God's essence is unknowable; creation is deified through participation in God's energies. In response to neo-scholastic criticism of this distinction, Lossky asserted that the distinction is a necessary antinomy for affirming participation in the uncreated life of God. The neo-scholastic, rationalistic notion of  <i class="calibre4">esse</i> only yields created grace, which contradicts the logic of divine–human communion. There exists, however, a tension between Lossky's affirmation of participation in the uncreated energies of God and his Trinitarian theology, as it leads to the inevitable question: If participation is in the divine energies, why is it necessary to affirm God as Trinity? To say that each of the persons of the Trinity conveys the divine energies in a distinctive manner is simply to beg the question. The contrast with Bulgakov here is telling: whereas, for Bulgakov, it is God's being as Trinity, and hence, as Sophia, which is the ground for the participation of the created in the life of God, in the Son and by the Holy Spirit, for Lossky, the ground of creation's participation in God is the essence/energies distinction, which leaves one wondering how God's being as Trinity matters for conceptualizing the God–world relation in terms of Page 7 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a><b class="calibre3">Contemporary Orthodox Currents on the Trinity</b> communion. Lossky's own theology of personhood indicates that it does matter, but it does not easily coexist with his non-negotiable affirmation of the essence/energies antinomy for expressing divine–human communion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Ontological Revolution</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the recent revival of Trinitarian theology, the influence of John Zizioulas (b. 1931) is indisputable, especially his theology of personhood. Both Lossky and Zizioulas considered themselves part of a movement in contemporary Orthodox theology that was  <b class="calibre3">(p. 335) </b>engaging in a ‘neo-patristic synthesis’, a phrase coined by Georges Florovsky in opposition to Bulgakovian sophiology. Though self-identified as part of the neo-patristic trajectory, Zizioulas distanced himself from two important elements that were common to the neo-patristic theologians: apophaticism and the essence/energies distinction. The Christian affirmation of divine–human communion implied a Trinitarian ontology that revolutionized Greek ontological monism, and which located the experience of God not in God's energies, but in the  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> of Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Christian doctrine of the Trinity is, according to Zizioulas, the inevitable result of the Christian experience of God in the Eucharist. Christians from the beginning understood the Eucharist as an event of communion with the Body of Christ in the Holy Spirit. It is this experience that grounds the Christian affirmation of the full divinity of Christ and the Holy Spirit, and hence, the doctrine of the Trinity (Zizioulas 1985: 80–3). </p>
