<p class="calibre1">In this configuration Rahner's great strength is that he manages to hold together both Trinitarian and ecclesial concerns, while being profoundly open to interreligious dialogues at every level (personal, social, spiritual, philosophical, and theological). Rahner also suggests a positive relation to non-Christians. In so much as God may be discovered <b class="calibre3">(p. 578) </b>in the religions then Christians have much to learn in interreligious dialogues while still being under the demand to preach the good news to all people. Rahner suggested that the historian of religion had the job to check the validity of the ‘anonymous Christianity’ thesis. Here again he was ground-breaking in reconfiguring the history of religions within a theological reading. Rahner's achievement is considerable as is his impact on Catholic theology of religions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rahner has been criticized for the chauvinism of the term ‘anonymous Christian’, but that misses the point: the terminology is entirely intra-Christian theological reflection. The ontological claims are important and there are Trinitarian problems that arise. First, Rahner's deployment of the Spirit seems to take what is traditionally the Spirit's function of upholding and sustaining creation and turns it into a redemptive grace. The converse side of this conflation of supernatural saving grace with nature is the minimizing, if not abandonment, of the atoning significance of Christ's cross. As Rowan Williams nicely puts it (1986) when contrasting Rahner with Balthasar, Rahner tends to see a world full of well-meaning humanists while Balthasar sees instead torture, violence, and institutional greed raping human dignity. The first group simply needs to be led to the teleological fulfilment of the path upon which it treads, while the second needs to be shaken from that path to walk anew. The first has somehow overcome original sin without Christ. Williams rightly warns against pressing these contrasts too rigidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, we can pursue this Trinitarian line of questioning by seeing that Rahner develops two economies, an invisible and visible Trinitarian action in the world, which never seems to come together. The invisible Trinity operates for anonymous Christians bringing them to salvation while the visible Trinity operates for explicit Christians bringing them to salvation. But is that in fact the case? To rephrase the problem: how can the anonymous Christian enjoy the beatific vision that on Rahner's own accounting requires an explicit knowledge of the triune God without that implicit grace becoming explicit? Rahner's answer to this question is indirect and is explicitly addressed in his early theology of death developed separately from Rahner's ‘anonymous Christian’ reflections (Rahner 1965). Here, the after-life provides the place where this implicit knowledge becomes explicit knowledge which is required for salvation. The proper implication thus is that the relationship to Christ that the non-Christian has is more accurately understood as a ‘potentiality’ rather than an ‘actuality’, which is what St Thomas teaches when he discusses this question ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.8, a.3, ad1). Rahner conflates potentiality with actuality precisely because he has conflated nature with supernatural saving grace. The universality of the Spirit's action has in Rahner almost overcome the particularity of Christ's action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p606"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> Let me follow Rahner's Trinitarian orientation to flesh out Trinitarian issues through two Catholic theologians deeply influenced by him: Jacques Dupuis (1923–2004) and Raimundo Panikkar (1918–2010). Dupuis develops Rahner's position to make three bold new Trinitarian moves which attend to some of the difficulties I have raised against Rahner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, he explains the presence of Christ in the non-Christian's inner life and religion in terms of a distinction between the Logos  <i class="calibre4">asarkos</i> and  <i class="calibre4">ensarkos</i>, the first being the non-incarnate saving action of the Word, the second being the incarnate saving  <b class="calibre3">(p. 579) </b>action in the particularity of Christ (Dupuis 1997: 297–300). This is not unlike the anonymous and explicit Christian. Second, in parallel, Dupuis extends the economy of the Holy Spirit beyond the actions of the incarnate Word ( <i class="calibre4">ensarkos</i>) to explain the legitimacy of non-Christian religions. Third, he detaches the action of the Trinity from the visible sign of the Church so that, while salvation for the non-Christian always happens through the grace of Christ in the power of his Spirit, it does not require any ecclesial mediation or visible relationship to the Church and also does not require non-Christians to become Christians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Trinitarian grounds all three moves have been criticized by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (2001) entrusted to safeguard the deposit of the Catholic faith. First, Christologically Dupuis implies that there can be ‘separation between the Word and Jesus, or between the Word's salvific activity and that of Jesus, [or] that there is a salvific activity of the Word as such in his divinity, independent of the humanity of the incarnate Word’. This parallels Rahner's explicit and implicit Christological distinction. Second, pneumatologically Dupuis implies that ‘the salvific action of the Holy Spirit extends beyond the one universal salvific economy of the Incarnate Word’. Rahner never does this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dupuis self-consciously does move towards what he calls an ‘inclusive pluralism’. Third, ecclesiologically, for while it is right ‘to maintain that the Holy Spirit accomplishes salvation in non-Christians also through those elements of truth and goodness present’ in them, it is not legitimate to ‘hold that these religions, considered as such, are ways of salvation…because they contains omissions, insufficiencies and errors regarding fundamental truths about God, man and the world’. Again, Rahner stops short of this move, although his term ‘legitimate religion’, drawn from Israel before the coming of Christ and analogically applied to other religions, is a step on this path, but one that Rahner refused to take, as a ‘legitimate religion’ becomes ‘illegitimate’ for the person who has heard the Gospel and rejected it, not for other adherents of that religion. It is important to note that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in no way denies the reality of God's saving presence in elements of the world religions and in persons themselves, and the reality of the Holy Spirit's presence. What is at stake is the best Trinitarian way this might be best explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether I (or the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) have interpreted Dupuis's writings correctly, his contribution is important for pushing forward the Trinitarian agenda. The same might be said of Panikkar who in his early work (1964) replicated Rahner's position, but in his later work (1981, the revised edition of 1964; and 1973) made bold steps forward although in an eclectic manner. I think many of his later steps (Christological, pneumatological, and ecclesiological) are akin to Dupuis. (Interestingly Dupuis criticizes Panikkar's Christology for precisely that which the Congregation for the Doctrine of Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p607"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> the Faith criticizes Dupuis (Dupuis 1997: 151–2)). However, Panikkar also develops what he calls a vision of a ‘cosmotheandric reality’ whereby the ‘modalities’ of the Father, Son, and Spirit are mutually corrective pointers towards the divine mystery. The Father represents the apophatic truth that the divine is utterly other, such that nothing can be properly said of ‘it’ and silence is the purest way of responding to this unfathomable mystery. Allied to this path is the way of mysticism  <b class="calibre3">(p. 580) </b>and asceticism which strips down the pretensions of the self in the light of the ‘nothingness’ of the divine. This brings about a deep self-surrender or self-forgetfulness, and thus a profound compassion, love, and service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sees various strands of apophatic mysticism within Christianity, and most profoundly within Theravada Buddhism and Advaita Hinduism. However, for Panikkar there is always a danger of indifference to the world in this mystical path. The Son is an icon compared to the utter mystery of the Father that is beyond all forms. The ‘Son’ represents the path of devotion and personalism, the ecstasy of love and joy, mercy and forgiveness, personal reconciliation and humanity. Indeed, Panikkar reads the  <i class="calibre4">kenosis</i> of Christ, his self-emptying, in terms of the  <i class="calibre4">sunyata</i> and  <i class="calibre4">nirvana</i> of Buddhism. He also sees theistic Hinduism within this iconic spirituality. If the danger of the Father's path was worldly indifference, the danger of the Son's path is anthropocentricism, making the human the measure of all things, or in its divine form, assuming God to be a ‘person’ writ large. The Spirit represents the unseen mediator which is only seen in its powerful effects. This path is also associated with power and charism and Panikkar relates this to the Shaivite Sakti tradition in Hinduism and Tantric Buddhist traditions that map the deep powers within the human in which the divine resides, the  <i class="calibre4">kundalini</i>. The danger of this path is that of idolizing works or rites. Panikkar is content to allow the reality of each tradition to fructify and transform the other, while recognizing that none has the whole truth and all have some truth, a truth which is pluriform, not unitary. Religions are thus complementary paths to the cosmotheandric reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panikkar's approach is especially helpful for his vast erudition and intimate knowledge of the eastern traditions and for his Trinitarian appreciation of many aspects of the world's religions. It would be better that the cosmotheandric reality be construed as an analogical resonance to the mystery of the Trinity, as  <i class="calibre4">vestigia Trinitatis</i>. This would usefully provide points of contact for respectful exploration and dialogues. However, for Panikkar there is almost an inversion of the  <i class="calibre4">vestigia</i> tradition, for he seems to want to say that Christianity itself has vestiges of the cosmotheandric reality that are far greater and deeper than disclosed in the Christian revelation. The symbolic triadic structure subordinates the historical particular narrative of revelation. It is certainly true that Christian revelation cannot be equated with the fullness of God's mystery as if nothing more of God can be said, known, or worshipped. However, it is held that the revelation given in the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">is</i> that of God's very self, whom we will come to know face to face only in heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have critically examined this small selection of Trinitarian theologians to show that many of the problems identified by non-Trinitarian theologians are robustly met within a Trinitarian theology. Respect for others, learning from the religions, as well as working together for the common good, are all richly facilitated within a Trinitarian orientation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, a Trinitarian orientation might also call for a deep critique of other religions Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p608"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> when they stifle the common good or extinguish the ‘lights’ within sectors of their own tradition. This is politically and socially complicated, but necessary from a theological standpoint. I have drawn attention to critical aspects of these theologies not to minimize their important contributions, but to alert the reader to many unresolved issues once the <b class="calibre3">(p. 581) </b>Trinitarian path is walked. There are many other theologians who might have been profitably discussed in this section such as Colin Gunton, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Clark Pinnock, and S. Mark Heim (see Kärkkäinen 2004 for a useful survey of Trinitarian theologies of religion). Word-limits in part account for their exclusion as well as my judgement that the four above help to lay a trail well worth heeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Let me draw together some of the threads above. I want to suggest that five mysteries of the faith (Spirit, Son, Father, Church, kingdom) need to be constantly held together in tension to properly theologically reflect upon interreligious dialogues. When these five are held together they open all sorts of rich avenues along which to develop a Christian engagement with the religions. To forget the Son is to erase the scandal of particularity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To forget the Spirit is to erase the universal outreach of the Son's work. To forget the Father is to forget the unitive purpose of the triune revelation: a communion of love. To forget the Church is to erase the visible sign of Trinitarian glory in the liturgy and the liturgy's reach in transforming creation. To forget the kingdom is to erase the justice and peace inaugurated in Christ's person that might transform the earth into heaven. In what follows, there are many points made that require substantial argument and development before they can commend themselves more fully, but I wish to draw a wide portrait to help with a Trinitarian orientation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Catholic Church is clear about two realities and one problematic implication of these two realities. First, those who are not Christians, who have not rejected or heard the Gospel are offered the means to salvation in some way or other.  <i class="calibre4">Lumen Gentium</i> 16 puts it thus: ‘Nor does divine Providence deny the helps that are necessary for salvation to those who, through no fault of their own, have not yet attained to the express recognition of God yet who strive, not without divine grace, to lead an upright life’ (Tanner 1990: 861). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, in this providential mystery non-Christians are related to the paschal mystery through the Holy Spirit. From  <i class="calibre4">Gaudium et Spes</i> 22: ‘For, since Christ died for all, and since the ultimate vocation of man is in fact one, and divine, we ought to believe that the Holy Spirit in a manner known only to God offers to every man the possibility of being associated with this Paschal Mystery’ (Tanner 1990: 1082). But the manner in which salvation takes place, the problematic implication, is a matter for theological investigation (Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith 2000: no. 21). I have developed one tentative solution elsewhere in some detail which utilizes the Apostle's creedal confession that Christ ‘descended into hell’ (D’Costa 2009: 161–211). In brief, I argue that in the same way that most Christians are purified in preparation for the beatific vision (a process usually called ‘purgatory’—which need not have the stage machinery of flames and fire and the typology of duration), so might it be for non-Christians who have accepted God's Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p609"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> grace in this life, whose potentiality must result in an actuality—through God's grace and in His judgement. I analogically draw upon the ancient tradition of the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 582) </b>descent into the underworld where Christ preaches to the righteous, both Jews and Gentiles, who lived before him and through his grace are destined for salvation. I argue that this ‘descent’ takes place in every eucharist, where Christ's saving death is enacted, and the prayers for the entire world by the Church entail the Church's involvement in this salvation. The early Church used this solution to address the righteous before Christ and I argue that the righteous after Christ are in an analogically similar position. I think this speculative solution helps resolve various imbalances that we have seen in other Trinitarian approaches. It allows us to respect the real differences that are visible and culturally enacted within other religions. It allows that many of these particularities are preparations. It allows respect for the difference between an explicit meeting of Christ as central to the preaching of the Gospels and the way in which Christ's work in the Spirit is already under way in history. It allows for a relation of the particular Christ to the universal action of the Spirit, keeping intact the centrality of the incarnate Word rather than a disembodied Logos. It keeps intact the necessity of both the Trinity and the Church in the order of salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This orientation suggests, following Vatican II, that we could productively view other religions as potential  <i class="calibre4">praeparatio evangelica</i> and  <i class="calibre4">semina Verbi</i>. In the light of contemporary experience, this solution helps to explain the deep fonts of wisdom and truth found within other religions. These particular truths act as a  <i class="calibre4">praeparatio</i>. As  <i class="calibre4">vestigia Trinitatis</i> they might lead a person more deeply into truth, goodness, and holiness, for they are truths from God, consonant with his Word ( <i class="calibre4">semina Verbi</i>) even if they are not themselves the Word. Here we have the particularity of Christ's action made universal through the action of the Spirit, but both are fragmentary due to human sin, and both are echoes of that reality enacted in the drama of redemption. The Church is not immune from this experience of fragmentariness as it is made of saints and sinners, but its sacramental nature stands as a visible reality of the grace of God's Trinity. The relation of these ‘lights’ to the ‘Light’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">within the Church will be dealt with below. They cannot be domesticated or subordinated as if they never called the Church into question. Non-violent practices, profound meditation techniques, care for widows, a scathing apophatic critique of idolatries are just a small list of examples whereby Christians may be deeply called into question by the religions and their practices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The critic may press arguing that this solution just fails to match the pastoral experience we have of good, true, and holy non-Christians. This is a complex matter. There is no doubt that many non-Christians reflect the values of the kingdom far more bravely, resolutely, and charitably than many a Christian. There is no doubt that many non-Christians preach a message that is closer to the holy mystery of God's revelation than some preaching that is heard from pulpits. But is this really what is at stake? I think not. What is at stake is the objective truth of the Christian Gospel. It is for this reason alone that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith criticized some of Dupuis’ moves that render salvific equality to other religions. In terms of objective truth, other religions for all their wisdom contain ‘omissions, insufficiencies and errors regarding fundamental truths about Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p610"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> God, man and the world’. They do not preach a Trinitarian God and a crucified Christ, a witness that might call into question the practices of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 583) </b>Knitter and Pieris remind us that social justice historically is often the prerogative of a non-Christian religion and not the Church, and the latter heralds in the kingdom of God. I have noted the difficulty of employing the ‘kingdom of God’ as if Gospel values could be shorn of their relationship to the person of Jesus Christ. I have also argued that God works in whatever manner He chooses, often through non-Christians and their religious traditions. But the ‘kingdom’ is not an ideological and political manifesto, but rather the in-breaking of God's rule through discipleship and a ‘normal’ martyrdom in resistance to the ways of the world. In this sense, Barth's recognition of ‘parables’ and ‘lights’ in the non-Christian world is significant as it acknowledges that much is to be learnt from Others. But we should be careful about attributing, without qualification, the coming of God's kingdom when it is detached from a witness to the triune God. All witness to the truth of course participates in God's will, but the Gospel cannot be reduced to a social programme and is always and finally a call to discipleship in Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Discipleship to the Trinity enjoins what the Catholic Church calls the social doctrine of the Church, a rich deposit that has only been uncovered and explicated in the last hundred years. This social doctrine is rooted in God's revelation, His plan of love for all humanity (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace 2004: 13–31). This requires that the Church work with all religions to further the ‘common good’. Clearly, discerning the ‘common good’ is a task that employs Christian criteria regarding social justice but, precisely because this is not an ideology or political programme, engagements in interreligious dialogues can deepen the sense of what the ‘common good’ is, as well as forge bonds between religious communities to strive together to achieve the common good. This takes place in practice in virtually all countries where the contingent political arrangements in place mean differing forms of social action, sometimes with other religions and sometimes in critique of other religions. Through such processes Christian communities will also learn how they have failed in the past and present to promote the common good, and humility and contrition is required in this process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is the relation of the Church to the  <i class="calibre4">vestigia Trinitatis</i> to be found in the religions? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer takes us to the question of inculturation. There can be no question that everything that is true, good, and holy within the cultures and religions of the world will find a place within the Church, but, as with the gold of the Egyptians, they may not quite find the same place they had originally. But the lustre will shine forth more fully and could even sometimes be a critique of the religions from which it arises. For example, Jews for Jesus rightly argue that Israel has failed to recognize its messiah, that which was promised to it. It has failed to fully grasp the fullness of the promises. Jews for Jesus also need to criticize Christians who live as if God's messiah had not come. Please note, this does not mean a negation of the Jewish covenant, but a fulfilment in which it is honoured and elevated. Or to switch examples, it may be that Buddhist converts and Christian mediators searching for disciplined practices of ‘mindfulness’ will rejoice in the powerful techniques and traditions of meditation within Buddhism. In utilizing them within Christ</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p611"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> ian discipleship they might need to critique the telos of Buddhist meditational practices and also perhaps criticize the restlessness and wordiness of some liturgical experimentations. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 584) </b>Finally, inculturation also relates to the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity and the liturgical practices of the Church. The metaphysical underpinning and the terminological conceptualizing of the Trinity are deeply indebted to the Greek philosophical heritage. Substance, accidents, potentiality, actuality, hypostasis, and perichoresis are not biblical terms. Hence, as the Church inculturates globally, there will be other ways of speaking the truth of God's Trinity, other ways that will be strange and ‘alien’ to the Latin West, and other ways that will deepen the understanding of God's mystery. But there is a need to test their continuity with the Church's Graeco-Latin heritage so that philosophy and culture do not dictate to revelation, but rather revelation shapes these cultures and philosophy to find appropriate articulation. This is an immensely complex process which often allows very wise judgements in hindsight. It is rather akin to the debate about modernity that still rages in Christian western circles. The liturgical issue also has a current analogue: the debate about the advisability of Latin as a universal language of the Church (even though it represents a western location) rather than the parochial contingency of vernacular liturgies with the attendant danger of different liturgies and meanings. The problems are complex and the solutions very difficult, but what is at stake once more is honourable worship of the true God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much work needs to be done in this field. I have only scratched a rich surface of a multi-faceted reality. I have tried to bring to light the richness, complexity, and challenges of developing a Trinitarian orientation to interreligious dialogues. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article explores the relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity for discussions about globalization and postmodern theories of culture. It suggests that Trinitarian love infuses culture with a self-giving and teleological order that overcomes the ongoing mechanization and monetization of culture. It cites Pope John Paul II's theology of marriage and the family as an example of this renewal through self-giving love. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Immanuel Kant famously wrote that the doctrine of the Trinity, taken literally, has no practical relevance at all, even if we think we understand it. Whether we are to worship three or ten persons in the deity makes no difference. At the polar end from Kant, Nicolai Fedorov, a nineteenth-century Orthodox theologian, coined the expression ‘the Trinity is our social programme’. Fedorov's thesis was taken up in the twentieth century by Paul Evdokimov who argued that through Christ's Incarnation the whole of humanity enters into God as its ontological place. Miroslav Volf summarizes Evdokimov's thesis as the idea that because the resurrection of Christ is immanent to all human beings, the participation in the triune life of God is not just an eschatological promise, but a present reality and therefore also a historical program. Ted Peters however rejects Evdokimov's thesis as overly optimistic and not sufficiently appreciating the vast gulf that separates humanity from divinity. Similarly, Karen Kilby has suggested that the meeting of Trinitarian theology with social theory runs the risk of becoming an excuse for the projection of fashionable political concepts onto God. Scholars have a tendency to fill out Trinitarian concepts with notions borrowed from human experiences of relatedness, thereby making the Trini</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p614"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> ty a ‘resource for combating individualism, patriarchy and oppressive forms of political and ecclesiastical organisation’ (Kilby 2000: 438). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Volf tries to steer a middle position between Peters and Evdokimov. As he sees it: ‘the question is not whether the Trinity should serve as a model for human community; the question is rather in which respects and to what extent it should do so’ (Volf 1998: 405). </p>
<p class="calibre1">He argues that there are two basic limits to modelling the human community on the Trinity: <b class="calibre3">(p. 587)</b> First, since ontically human beings are manifestly not divine and since noetically human notions of the Triune God do not correspond exactly to who the Triune God is, Trinitarian concepts such as ‘person’, ‘relation’, or ‘perichoresis’ can be applied to human community only in an analogous rather than a univocal sense. (Volf 1998: 405)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, because of sin human beings can never be perfect images of the Trinity in this world. Volf prefers to say that the doctrine of the Trinity ought to shape our social vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An example of a merely analogical appropriation of Trinitarian theology to cultural analysis may be found in the following passage by Aidan Nichols who believes that it is possible to find in the Trinity a ‘key to the wider need of humanity's global culture to marry the universal and the particular, the unilateral insights of the Enlightenment into encyclopaedic universality, and of Romanticism into differentiated multiplicity, the One and the Many’:</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, a culture should be conscious of transcendence as its true origin and goal, and this we call culture's tacit ‘paterological’ dimension, its implicit reference to the Father. Second, the forms which a culture employs should manifest integrity—</p>
<p class="calibre1">wholeness and interconnectedness; clarity—transparency to meaning; and harmony—a due proportion in the ways that its constituent elements relate to the culture as a whole. And since these qualities—integrity, clarity and harmony—are appropriated in classical theology to the divine Son, the ‘Art’ of God and splendor of the Father, we can call such qualities of the beautiful form the specifically Christological aspects of culture … And thirdly, then, in the Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">taxis</i>, the spiritually vital and health-giving character of the moral ethos of our culture yields up culture's pneumatological dimension, its relation to the Holy Spirit. (Nichols 1999: 16–17)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Graham Ward links such analogical appropriations to Christ's call in the Gospel of St Matthew to read the signs of the times. Since the Church, ‘situated in an eschatological and soteriological management of time, established its teachings on the Trinity and the relationship of the Triune God to creation’, ‘reading the signs of the times is the Church's participation in that management’ and ‘Christians live in Christ and live pneumatologically through the practices of encountering, negotiating and interpreting the world around them’ (Ward 2000: 103). Ward describes Radical Orthodoxy as a project of Christian cultural criticism whose chief concern is ‘with unmasking the cultural idols, providing ge</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p615"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> nealogical accounts of the assumptions, politics and hidden metaphysics of specific secular varieties of knowledge—with respect to the constructive, therapeutic project of disseminating the Gospel’ (Ward 2000: 104). In doing so, the Radical Orthodoxy scholars have recovered the eastern concept of  <i class="calibre4">epektasis</i> in which God is not to be seen as an infinite positive quantity, but as forever ecstatically giving more and more, and they have contrasted this account of the Godhead with that of Duns Scotus, particularly his doctrine of the univocity of being, which they treat as the original and mortal sin of the history of theological speculation in the West. They also emphasize the temporal mediation and interpretation of the  <i class="calibre4">logos</i> and they offer a high Christology of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 588) </b>the cosmic Christ as <i class="calibre4">logos</i>, together with an appreciation of the particularity of the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth (Hughes and Bullimore 2002: 187). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Sovereignty of the Mob</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Both these elements of Radical Orthodoxy Christology are evident in Milbank's application of Giorgio Agamben's account of the  <i class="calibre4">homo sacer</i> in Roman jurisprudence to an analysis of the trial of Christ. After the succession of the plebs in Rome it was granted to them a right to pursue to the death someone whom they as a collective had condemned. Such an individual was declared  <i class="calibre4">homo sacer</i>—a person cast out from the community. For Milbank Christ is  <i class="calibre4">homo sacer</i> some three times over. He is abandoned first by the Jewish leaders to the Roman governor, then by those representing the sovereignty of Rome to the sovereign-executive mob, then finally by the sovereign-executive mob to the Roman soldiers. Milbank concludes that neither Jewish nor Roman law could be relied upon to condemn Christ; only a mob into which sovereign power and plebiscitary delegation had been collapsed could achieve this (Milbank 2003: 91–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Invalidation of the Secular</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘sovereignty of the mob’ and its juxtaposition with the sovereignty of Christ is a recurring theme in Milbank's analysis of contemporary western culture. Following Jean-Yves Lacoste and Olivier Boulnois, Milbank argues the sovereignty of Christ was lost with the rise of modern philosophy which did not simply emancipate itself from theology but arose from within the space of ‘pure nature’—‘a fiction’ created by theologians in the Baroque era. Whereas in the premodern reading, the Incarnation of Christ and the hypostatic descent of the Holy Spirit inaugurated on earth a counter-polity exercising a counter-sovereignty, nourished by sovereign victimhood, in the theology of Cajetan (1469–1534) and Suárez (1548–1617) a dualism develops between nature and grace and the natural and the supernatural, with the natural eventually finding itself equated with the secular and the supernatural finding itself equated with the sacred. The end result is that one whole dimension of reality, often described as the ‘public space’, is to be kept chastely uncontaminated by any claims of Christ to an exercise of His sovereignty. This Suárezian political theory was highly popular in mid twentieth-century Catholic social thought, but its claims to a classically Thomist pedigree have been severely questioned, Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p616"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> and it is now generally agreed that the notion of there being ‘two ends’ to human nature, one natural, and one supernatural, and corresponding secular and sacred orders, is alien to classical Thomism. Catholic scholars calling themselves ‘Whig Thomists’, an expression coined by Michael Novak, continue to foster the Suárezian dualism, and this fault line between those who follow Suárez and those who  <b class="calibre3">(p. 589) </b>prefer a more premodern interpretation is pivotal for theological engagements with the phenomena of globalization and postmodern culture. Those who follow Suárez tend to be less critical of globalization. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Univocity of Being</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While some scholars have focused on the Suárezian watershed, others have tracked the path toward a theologically autonomous natural and secular order to Duns Scotus ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1266–1308). In Matthew Levering's reading, Scotus opened the door to secularism by removing human-to-human relationships (in contrast to human-to-God relationships) in his account of the operation of the natural law (Levering 2008: 155). Catherine Pickstock also locates a decisive shift away from a metaphysics of participation in the work of Scotus toward the doctrine of the univocity of being, rendering Scotus the forerunner of the liberal tradition of political theory: The ‘representation’ of subjects as formal bearers of equal rights was possible only once their humanity had been abstracted from their creaturehood without any concomitant advance toward deification, a movement that was in parallel with the Franciscan shift toward an immanent levelling of perfection terms. (Pickstock 2005: 306)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin J. Vanhoozer has summarized von Balthasar's criticism of Scotus’ univocity of being doctrine in the following words:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Epistemologically, it provides a  <i class="calibre4">magna carta</i> for reason to undertake an independent study of all that has being without having recourse to revelation; the metaphysical project—the attempt to gain knowledge of being, including God, through reason—here achieves legitimacy. The ‘God’ thus known, however, is only a conceptual idol manufactured by human reason; and the ‘God’ proclaimed dead or unbelievable by Nietzsche is, likewise, only the construction of modern ‘ontotheology’. On this account, then, the deconstructive or nihilist versions of postmodernity are actually the logical culmination of basically modern tendencies. (Vanhoozer 2003: 21–2)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to the logical projections of the ontology of Scotus and Suárez and contemporary ‘Whig Thomists’, Milbank's understanding of the work of the Trinity within creation and redemption ‘forbids us to baptise the secular desert as the realm of pure reason, pure nature, natural law or natural rights’. Christians should not account for themselves ‘before a uniform liberal court’ which is itself ‘a fiction’, and one whose ‘dark inner secret is constitution by a voluntarist theology securing order through the formal regulation of chaos from a single sovereign centre’ (Milbank 2003: 121). Liberal democracy is a ‘mere Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p617"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> virtual circus designed to entertain the middle classes of the privileged world’ (Milbank 2003: 5). As Pickstock concludes: ‘The liberal politics of “representation” of supposedly originally isolated and fully autonomous individuals through the objective artifices of <b class="calibre3">(p. 590) </b>contract, money, politeness and parliamentary election has been challenged by the work of MacIntyre and Sandel and many others’ (Pickstock 2005: 280). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alasdair MacIntyre has described liberal democracies as sites of civil war between proponents of hostile moral traditions. In the terminology of Nichols, the Christological dimensions of postmodern culture are weak. MacIntyre's critiques of the role of bureaucratic practices are particularly helpful in explaining this weakness, as well as explaining the tendency towards social conformism and the banality of mass culture. In cultures characterized by conflicts of values between and within institutions individuals will be encouraged to fragment the self and wear different masks in different contexts in order to avoid social marginalization. MacIntyre argues that the behaviour of the Sartrean rebel is an attempt by the self to defend its integrity from the bureaucratic practices which divide it into its role-governed functions and the postmodern celebration of difference is also, at least in part, a reaction against what Weber called the iron cage of reason. Far from being ‘value neutral’ MacIntyre believes that bureaucratic practices are ideological, that is, specifically designed to serve a political end, in this case that of concealing the conflict between moral traditions. Since liberalism operates so as to preclude appeals to what might be described loosely as ‘ultimate values’ there is a social trend toward undermining the prudential judgement of professionals and circumscribing their actions with allegedly value-neutral mandatory regulations. As a consequence, professionals are ‘no longer trusted, but instead must be endlessly spied upon, and measured against a spatial checklist of routinized procedure that is alien to all genuine inculcation of excellence’ (Milbank 2003: 185). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stanley Hauerwas has summarized much of the above cultural criticism with the statement that ‘postmodernism is the outworking of mistakes in Christian theology correlative to the attempt to make Christianity “true” apart from faithful witness’. In other words, postmodernity would not have arisen but for the errors of Christian theologians: Modernity, drawing on the metaphysics of a transcendent god, was the attempt to be historical without Christ. Postmodernity, facing the agony of living in history with no end, is the denial of history. In the wake of such a denial, the only remaining comfort is the shopping mall, which gives us the illusion of creating histories through choice, thus hiding from us the reality that none of us can avoid having our lives determined by money. Money, in modernity, is the institutionalization of the univocity of being that Scotus thought necessary to ensure the unmediated knowledge of God. (Hauerwas 2007: 149)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hauerwas concurs with Fredric Jameson that postmodernism is the logic of late capitalism in which the production of culture has been integrated into commodity production, thus creating the need for continuous waves of novelty. For Hauerwas it is obvious that this condition creates a self which is at best fragmented, at worst, multiple, and that this Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p618"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> is something that Christians need to survive. They should not seek to accommodate themselves to it, or correlate their faith with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 591) Globalization and the Culture of Death</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to the problem of the sovereignty of the mob and the bogus neutrality of the secular public space, there is the further problem of globalization. As Christa Van der Westhuizen argues, globalization is not a benign and neutral process. It is rather ‘the practical consequences of the implementation of the ideology of neo-liberalism, which, in the name of competition and efficiency, pursues a world in which the market reigns supreme over society’ (Van der Westhuizen 2009: 1). Van der Westhuizen quotes Pierre Bourdieu: ‘Today's neoliberal capitalism utilises the lexicon of liberty, liberalism and deregulation to grant economic determinisms a fatal stranglehold by liberating them from all controls, and to obtain the submission of citizens and governments to the economic and social forces thus “liberated” ’. It is precisely this element of contemporary culture, whether one calls it globalization or the cultural consequences of late capitalism, which is regarded as particularly toxic to any attempt to model human society on Trinitarian relations. Social life itself is now embedded in market relationships (which rarely, if ever, have anything to do with love), rather than market relationships being embedded in social life. Lieven Boeve argues that the ideology of the market provides the contemporary master narrative: ‘Commodification separates cultural objects from their original associations and narratives, and makes them available for exchange on the market, items to be acquired for a price that frequently does not square with their real value’ (Boeve 2007: 23). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ward has similarly argued that the ‘death of God has brought about the prospect of the reification and commodification (theologically termed idolatry), not only of all objects, but of all values (moral, aesthetic and spiritual)’. Now everything is not only measured and priced but it has an image: ‘The age of the Promethean will to power has been superseded by the age of Dionysian diffusion, in which desire is governed by the endless production and dissemination of floating signifiers’ (Ward 2001: xiv). In a world where there is no relation between signifier and signified there is a general meaninglessness which can lead to depression, despair, and even a preference for death over life. This thesis was presented by John Paul II in  <i class="calibre4">Evangelium Vitae</i> (1995) and Pickstock in After Writing (1998). John Paul II spoke of a culture of death and Pickstock of a polity of death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ward notes that a paradox here is that, although the neo-liberalism underpinning globalization promotes itself with reference to greater consumer choice, the culture it generates is renowned for its standardization of almost every dimension of life. This criticism has also been made by William T. Cavanaugh who sees homogeneity and the depthlessness of signs as key symptoms of globalization and postmodernism: Globalization is an aesthetic, a way of seeing the world, of reading its images and signs. Frederic Jameson is right, I think, to call postmodernism the ‘cultural logic of late capitalism’, for in both it is the surface image that counts. In globalized Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p619"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> capitalism, exchange value has overcome use value, and what is desired is desire itself. Postmodernism as well trumpets the vacuity of signs, such that the signifier refers  <b class="calibre3">(p. 592) </b>only to other signifiers, not to the signified. As Jameson says, postmodernism is a leap in what Benjamin called the ‘aestheticization’ of reality, the cutting loose of representations from what they represent … This depthlessness of signs is captured by Andy Warhol's Campbell soup cans. As Jameson comments, Warhol's art ought to be a powerful political critique of commodity fetishism. That it is not makes it postmodern. Even the critique of commodities has itself become a commodity. (Cavanaugh 2001: 333)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Eucharist and the Transcendental Logo</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Cavanaugh endorses Christopher Clausen's statement that America is a graveyard of cultures—the ‘melting pot is where cultures come to die’. It destroys particularity. In contrast, eucharistic theology ‘produces a catholicity which does not simply prescind from the local, but contains the universal Catholic within each local embodiment of the Body of Christ’ (Cavanaugh 1999: 182). As a consequence, ‘the consumer of the Eucharist is no longer the schizophrenic subject of global capitalism, awash in a sea of unrelated presents, but walks into a story with a past, present and future’ (Cavanaugh 1999: 192). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity rather than Whigish globalization is  <i class="calibre4">the</i> tradition in which the division between plain folk and aristocrat, universal and particular, parish and global community, can ultimately be reconciled. Within this tradition there is a most sacred place, but it exists beyond time in the eternity of the New Jerusalem; while in the period between the first Easter and the consummation of the world, the eucharist unites the universal and the particular in a multitude of sacred places across the globe. As Gottfried Benn elegiacally expressed the idea in his poem  <i class="calibre4">Verlorenes Ich</i>: Oh, when they all bowed towards one centre and even the thinkers only thought the god, when they branched out to the shepherds and the lamb, each time the blood from the chalice had made them clean/and all flowed from the one wound, all broke the bread that each man ate—oh, distant compelling fulfilled hour, which once enfolded even the lost ego. (Benn 1960: 215)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cavanaugh's conclusion is powerfully supported by Naomi Klein's  <i class="calibre4">No Logo</i> which has become the manifesto of the anti-globalization movement. According to Klein brand-name multinational corporations sell images and lifestyles rather than simple commodities: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Branding is about ideas, attitudes, lifestyle and values all embodied in the logo. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">“transcendental logo” replaces the corporeal world of commodities, of “earthbound products” ’ (Klein 2002: 22). When the sovereignty of Christ is replaced by the sovereignty of the mob, the consumption of the Body and Blood of Christ is replaced by the consumption of brands which serve as symbols of some desired personal or social attribute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, a pair of Dolce e Gabbana underpants will cost several times the money of the same garment without the embroidered logo. The consumer does not buy  <b class="calibre3">(p. 593) </b>the expensive designer label product because of superior quality fabric or tailoring, but be</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p620"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> cause he believes that the logo will pseudo-sacramentally convey a desired attribute such as the physical prowess of David Beckham. The market power of brands and logos attests to a sublimated need in postmodernity for the sacramental, that is, for signs, symbols, and grace which help to define the self. As de Maeseneer observes, brand-name multinational corporations have their own theo-aesthetic programme (de Maeseneer 2003: 8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cavanaugh believes that ‘the  <i class="calibre4">kenosis</i> of God creates the possibility of a human subject very different from the consumer self’; however both he and Pickstock reach the conclusion that the Trinitarian solution to the lost or homeless ego is currently eclipsed by the market. The logos of designer brands have replaced the eucharist as the source of the unity or disunity of the self (Cavanaugh 2001: 342). For Cavanaugh, Pickstock, and Milbank, the current global neo-liberalism represents a rival sacrality to that of Christ: ‘Economic relations do not operate on value-neutral laws, but are rather carriers of specific convictions about the nature of the human person, its origins and its destiny. There is an implicit anthropology and an implicit theology in every economics’ (Cavanaugh 2001: 325). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Form of Love and the Form of the Machine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">David L. Schindler, the editor of the English language edition of  <i class="calibre4">Communio</i>, the journal founded by Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Joseph Ratzinger (now Benedict XVI), agrees that elements of globalization and postmodernism can be tracked back to Scotus and Suárez, but in his own genealogy he has focused on the dualisms of Descartes. Schindler distinguishes between a secular logic which has as its hallmark the principle of simple identity (x=x) and what he calls a ‘credal logic’. The features of a secular logic come to expression in the manner in which causal activity is understood primarily in terms of effectivity, that is, in the manner in which epistemological primacy is accorded to negation, doubt, and control, over affirmation, faith, and openness; and in the manner in which meaning is derived by breaking the action or question into ever smaller bits for an analysis of the simplest conceptual units, or by the addition of differences. In contrast, the ‘credal’ logic has as its hallmark the principle of identities already in relation, as with the Trinity. Its features come to expression in several different ways: causal activity understood first as forceful gives way to activity that is from within and to effective activity now understood to be creative and generous rather than self-assertive; and the primacy of negation, doubt, and control gives way to a primacy of affirmation, receptivity, and receptiveness. Schindler does not argue that the two logics are exclusive, but rather that it matters a great deal which logic is accorded primacy. The principle of simple identity forces inclusion by way of dualistic addition, <b class="calibre3">(p. 594) </b>whereas the presupposition of the principle of relation leads to inclusion by way of integration. Concretely, the form of the secular logic is mechanical and thus sexual relations hollowed out into their material shell become lustful manipulation, political relations extracted from sacred bonds of brotherhood in Christ become brute power, and market relations extracted from a concern for the common good become hedonistic consumerism, while the music and ar</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p621"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> chitecture generated by the laws of such market relations become noise and harsh ugliness (Schindler 1990: 19). Schindler characterizes the problem as a double dualism: The tendency is to separate form, that is, the meaning which gives the shape to a culture's institutions and patterns of life, from love, and this separation presupposes a more basic separation of nature from God; so that form, abstracted from love, becomes externalised, manipulative and forceful; while love abstracted from form, becomes blind and empty of order (Schindler 1995: 201). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schindler observes that the modern nihilism of mechanical identity opens of its inner dynamic into the postmodern nihilism of dispersal, though the post in postmodernity signals what is in fact only the later arrival of what is structurally implied already in Modernity's Cartesianism (Schindler 2008: 240). Moreover, Schindler concludes that while postmodernity exposes the sense in which modernity's form is static and lifeless identity (i.e. mechanistic) and modernity's event is empty and arbitrary movement, it does so effectively by annihilating form, leaving, in the end, only movement that, as formless, leaves intact the terms of modernity (Schindler 2000: 709). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following von Balthasar, Schindler offers the Trinitarian form of love as the alternative to the form of the machine: the Incarnation of the Son of God in Jesus Christ ‘reaches all the way down through the “flesh” of the entire created cosmos’ (Schindler 2004: 126). The Incarnation means it is theoretically possible to build a culture or civilization of love (as John Paul II called it) on the Trinitarian form of identities in relation rooted in a receptivity to love. Alternatively, a culture built on the principles of force and effect is a culture which no longer believes or trusts in love. It is a Stoic, Pelagian, mechanistic, bureaucratic, and ultimately passionless culture. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Family, and Sexual Identity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the second Vatican Council (1962–5) there has been an attempt by Catholic theologians to strengthen the connections between Trinitarian anthropology and issues of sexual identity and practice. In his development of a theology of the body, Karol Wojtyła eschewed the use of Stoic categories and instead spoke of love as a gift of the self, of spousal love as the paradigmatic gift of the self, and of the Trinity as the archetype of such a gift (Wojtyła 1993: 301–14). Anthropology was linked to Trinitarian theology and sexuality was situated within this framework of God's offer of divine filiation. William <b class="calibre3">(p. 595) </b>Norris Clarke described the link between anthropology and Trinitarian theology in the following words:</p>
<p class="calibre1">If every being turns out to include a natural dynamism toward self-communication through action, we can say truly, in more than a metaphorical sense, that every being is naturally a self-symbolizer, an icon or image-maker, in some analogous way like an artist, expressing itself symbolically, whether consciously or unconsciously </p>
<p class="calibre1">… Th[is] self-symbolizing tendency in all the finite beings we know turns out to be an imperfect participation or imitation of the inner being of God himself, revealed Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p622"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> to be supremely and perfectly self-symbolizing in its eternal interior procession of the Son from the Father and the Holy Spirit from both. (Clarke 2004: 52) Within this new katalogical framework the married couple may be raised to the exalted position of being a ‘radiant icon of Trinitarian love’ and the seal of their marital holiness is viewed as nothing less than a ‘supernatural work of art’. In the words of Marc Ouellet: The hour of conjugal and family spirituality is therefore the hour of the transcendence of the self into the image of the Trinity, the hour of becoming a house of God, a home of the Most High, an icon of the Trinity, memory and prophecy of the wonders of salvation history. (Ouellet 2006: 99)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wojtyła's theology of the body and its appropriation in the works of Angelo Scola and Marc Ouellet has however been criticized as a too romantic account of really existing human relationships. Very few couples think of their family as an icon of the Trinity. Anthony Giddens has argued that part of the culture of modernity (and one may add its postmodern developments) is the transformation and democratization of intimacy. There are no longer commonly accepted standards or ideals for which human relationships might aim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no longer even agreement about what constitutes a marriage. Jose Granados concludes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Family relationships, reduced to fragile emotion that is to be integrated in the voice of individualistic reason, lose their capacity to indicate towards a broader horizon that precedes man and gives a greater frame to his life journey. As a result, there is no fixed orientation for the project of self realization: it is always open to the negotiation of the partners who need each other but are not in a condition of giving or demanding a lasting commitment that could resist the uncertainties of the future … [Thus, the question becomes] how can we preserve the truth of love and communion, so that it does not become an empty concept, whose plasticity leaves us without orientation in life, lost in the signs without meaning of an unintelligible personal map? (Granados 2007: 186)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The phenomenon of the endless renegotiation of the meaning of social bonds, especially those involving sexual intimacy, is not however regarded by all theorists as necessarily a bad thing. Some scholars seek to apply Trinitarian theology to an affirmation not only of sexual difference in itself but of a multitude of different social expressions of sexual difference. In this context the leading names are Gerard Loughlin, Lucy Gardner, David Moss, Luce Irigaray, Graham Ward, and Gavin D’Costa. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 596) </b>Common to proponents of this approach to Trinitarian theology is an interest in the category of ‘difference’ and not simply sexual difference  <i class="calibre4">per se</i>. Notable is Loughlin's reinterpretation of the classical Christian understanding of the divine Tri-unity as a counter-cultural expression of sexual relations that goes beyond heteronormativity, thus de-sacramentalizing marriage in any historical Catholic understanding. The interest in Trinitarian relations as a model for affirmations of, for example, homosexual relationships, often falls within this wider attempt to diffuse the sheer dynamism of the eternal Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p623"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> processions of God's inner life into embedded human relationships of difference in excess of accepted forms of practice in the historic Church. Amongst theologians who share these interests, a regular theme is the deconstruction of Balthasar's understanding of the relationship between sexual difference and difference in the body of the  <i class="calibre4">ecclesia</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Balthasar's symphonic relationship between these expressions of difference is viewed as unsympathetic to the complexities of varying social and cultural (sexual) contexts. In such a critique, appeal is often made to the philosophy of Irigaray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To what extent these scholars are really offering a new postmodern account of the social Trinity and not simply extensions of modernist presuppositions remains to be seen, but the importance of the Trinity as a pattern of life to be interpreted in the life of the Church is a common thread. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian and Postmodern Affinities</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding elements of the above, not every aspect of postmodern theory and practice is deemed hostile to a social order modelled on the Trinity. Compared to the culture of modernity, the culture of postmodernity is in some ways more hospitable to the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A summary of key elements in postmodern theories of culture which resonate well with Trinitarian theology may be found in the following paragraph by J. A. Di Noia: In the service of a broader conception of rationality, postmodern thinkers reject the modern quest for a foundation for all knowledge, modelled on mathematical or scientific paradigms of rationality … In assessing claims to rationality and truth, it is axiomatic for postmodern thinkers to attend to the context in which claims are embedded … In this connection and in sharp contrast to modernity postmodern thinkers insist on the centrality of tradition and authority in legitimating and supporting truth and rationality, not only in the religious but in the scientific and philosophical fields as well … Two other characteristic elements in postmodern thinking are its discovering of the rôle of texts and narratives in shaping thought and culture, and its stress on the importance of relationships and community in fostering personal identity. These emphases challenge rationalism and positivism in modern philosophy of language and epistemology, and individualism in modern moral and political philosophy … In addition postmodern thought views personal identity not  <b class="calibre3">(p. 597) </b>as an individualistically cultivated sense and performance of moral duty, but in a communally and relationally shaped life of virtue. (Di Noia 1990: 514)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is because of such affinities that John Milbank has described his theology as a ‘Postmodern Critical Augustinianism’, while Conor Cunningham has noted that the postmodern attack on pure reason represents a deconstruction of the secular which need not necessarily point towards nihilism: Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p624"></a><b class="calibre3">Globalization, Postmodern Theories of Culture, and the Trinity</b> If one links traditional analogy to the post-Renaissance sense of the human shaping of culture and being shaped in turn by culture one has in that way a kind of theological postmodern re-reading of our current intellectual plight: the relativity of culture cannot be sidestepped, yet the formation of culture is in itself a striving towards the infinite fullness of the Son who is ‘Word’ and the infinite exchange of the Spirit who is ‘Gift’. (Candler and Cunningham 2007: 526) Moreover, David S. Cunningham has drawn attention to how the postmodern themes of relationality, difference and rhetoric are all more ‘Trinitarian-friendly’ than ‘the modernist penchant for division, isolation and classification’ (what Schindler calls secular logic), the modern quest for the essence of ‘natural religion’ (in what Milbank calls the secular desert of Suárez) and the modern habit of approaching theology from within the boundaries of the categories of logic (what Pickstock would recognise as the icy cold hand of Duns Scotus on the Christian imagination) (Cunningham 2003: 186–202). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the pseudo-sacramentality of market globalization is unlikely to foster anything Evdokimov, Volf, or Nichols might recognize as social practices analogous to Trinitarian relations, the engagement between postmodern theories of culture and Trinitarian theology is likely to be more fruitful, especially if the sublimated quest for sacramentality is revealed to be nothing less than a desire for the gifts that only the Eucharist can bring:  <i class="calibre4">Per</i> <i class="calibre4">ipsum, et cum ipso, et in ipso, est tibi Deo Patri omnipotenti, in unitate Spiritus Sancti</i>. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article offers some thoughts about the future prospects of Trinitarian theology. It argues that the vocation of Trinitarian theology is “to think” the mystery of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit not in a rationalist fashion but to provide an account of it with the resources of human intelligence guided by faith, as much for the sake of believers. It lists eight important tasks that present themselves today to Trinitarian reflection. These include the need for Christian faith to show its monotheistic nature in a manner adapted to its object (God the Trinity himself) as well as to the cultures in which the Christian faith is expressed and the renewal of Trinitarian theology's reflection on the incomprehensibility of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, faith, Christian faith, cultures, incomprehensibility of God, monotheistic nature The vocation of Trinitarian theology is ‘to think’ the mystery of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, not in a rationalist fashion, but in order to confess the mystery, to live it, to proclaim it, and to give an account of it with the resources of human intelligence guided by faith, as much for the sake of believers ( <i class="calibre4">intellectus fidei</i>) as for the sake of dialogue with religious or secular cultures. The affirmation of one God in three persons or hypostases has no other foundation than the revelation and gift of God in history, in the person of Jesus Christ and in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The relation of Christians to their God passes through the concrete and singular history of Jesus, and through the experience of the coming of the Spirit. For this reason, Trinitarian faith cannot be the object of a rational reconstruction undertaken  <i class="calibre4">a priori</i> beyond (or apart from) the history in which God has freely taken the initiative of revealing himself. The confession of the Trinitarian unity of God expresses this fundamental experience of Christians:  <i class="calibre4">God reveals himself and</i> <i class="calibre4">gives himself as he is</i>. This means that, on the one hand, the confession of the Trinity is a <i class="calibre4">regulative</i> authority of Christian experience; on the other hand, it is equally and indissociably the  <i class="calibre4">expression</i> of an experience of salvation, salvation given in the Spirit of the crucified and risen Jesus who leads us to the Father. Twentieth-century theology developed this fundamental point around the concepts of self-revelation (Karl Barth) and self-com</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p629"></a><b class="calibre3">Conclusion: Prospects for Trinitarian Theology</b> munication (Karl Rahner), but expressions of this truth can be found throughout the history of Christian doctrine; this is, for example, what the ‘soteriological’ argument of many Fathers of the Church expresses: if the Son and the Holy Spirit communicate the divine life, it is because they are God with the Father. God reveals himself and gives himself as he is: this is the conviction which neither unitarian Arianism, nor Sabellian monarchianism, can uphold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the tasks that present themselves today to Trinitarian reflection, one can call attention to the following eight, without pretending to be exhaustive (our conclusion takes up several elements of Durand 2008 and Emery 2001). <b class="calibre3">(p. 601)</b> <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> Christian faith ought to show its monotheistic nature, in a manner adapted to its object (God the Trinity himself) as well as to the cultures in which the Christian faith is expressed. The western cultural context today no longer recognizes the primacy of unity, but instead valorizes complexity, diversity, and communion in differences. The conceptual and symbolic instrument that enables one to give an account of Trinitarian unity (‘Trinitarian monotheism’) constitutes one of the major problems in contemporary reflection. The modern (idealist) conception of the absolute Subject has shown its limits. Contemporary theology often attempts to think about the divine unity either by means of the eastern theme of the ‘monarchy of the Father’, or by means of notions of  <i class="calibre4">union</i> or  <i class="calibre4">communion</i>, conceived on the mode of an interpersonal, open, hospitable, and integrative exchange (a social and communitarian approach). It has been pointed out, however, that the hierarchical connotation (‘primacy’) of the theme of ‘monarchy’ has few affinities with the conceptual and symbolic resources of contemporary western culture; its use in our cultural situation is not without paradox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As regards the communitarian model, it is unable to convey the unity that the notions of ‘substance’ (‘essence’) and ‘subject’ sought to express, and it does not always avoid sliding toward tritheism. Can recourse to the notion of ‘perichoresis’, which today receives an important place in Christian reflection on God the Trinity, furnish an alternative to the notion of unity of essence? This seems unlikely, because the theme of Trinitarian perichoresis was developed from its beginnings (St John Damascene) and in its systematization (Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas) in direct relationship with unity of essence ( <i class="calibre4">ousia, essentia, substantia</i>): the concept of perichoresis  <i class="calibre4">includes</i> unity of essence, and it is unlikely that it could be detached from it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with these difficulties, an important theological current orients discourse on God principally toward metaphors and the description of experiences (see, for instance, Moltmann 2001). But metaphors and experiences, like concepts, must be submitted to a critical evaluation: what criteria can we rely on in order to evaluate the value of metaphors and experiences? And, if theology wants to keep in close relation to its patristic and medieval sources (a living relation to the tradition), does it not also need a synthetic or systematic discourse that requires organizing speculative principles so as to be able to articulate truth about God the Trinity? Whereas classical theologies were often confronted with the difficulty of conceiving the Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">plurality</i>, it seems that contemporary reflection more often encounters the difficulty of accounting for the Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">unity</i>. If Christian ‘Trinitarian monotheism’ wishes to Page 2 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p630"></a><b class="calibre3">Conclusion: Prospects for Trinitarian Theology</b> preserve its intelligibility, a clear notion of the divine unity is necessary. In this respect, the old concepts of ‘essence’ and ‘substance’ seem hard to replace, especially if one wishes to affirm the coherence of Trinitarian dogma with the Christological dogma of Chalcedon (Christ Jesus, the incarnate Son, is ‘one person’ subsisting in </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘two natures’): the concepts of essence, substance, nature, and hypostasis cannot be just put aside or ignored (Emery 2009). Rather, these words can still be used today, and their meaning must be explained with the resources proper to each culture. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 602) (2)</b> In affirming that God the Trinity reveals himself and gives himself as he is, Trinitarian theology should renew its reflection on the  <i class="calibre4">incomprehensibility</i> of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faith in the Trinitarian unity of God comprises simultaneously the recognition of a transcendence that does not deny the proximity of God to humans (Christology, pneumatology), and the recognition of a proximity that does not negate God's transcendence. Divine incomprehensibility—a fundamental feature of theological discourse about the Trinity—has in Christianity a proper status and specific value. Indeed, it is precisely at the moment of the first maturity of the elaboration of Trinitarian dogma, in the second half of the fourth century, that the incomprehensibility of God receives a determinative status in Christian thought and preaching. Among many writings from this period, see, for instance, St John Chrysostom's homilies on God's incomprehensibility (John Chrysostom 1984). The recognition of the incomprehensibility of God, as a response to radical Arianism (‘Anomoeanism’, which claimed that the essence of God can be defined), implies that Trinitarian unity is beyond any image (see, for instance, the  <i class="calibre4">Theological Oration</i> 31.31–3 by St Gregory of Nazianzus (Gregory of Nazianzus 1978: 338–43; Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 141–3)). God's incomprehensibility is an aspect of the ‘conversion of concepts’ that is demanded by the newness of the God revealed in Jesus Christ. It is not only a philosophical truth about God, but also—and in a deeper sense—a  <i class="calibre4">Trinitarian</i> affirmation. In this light, the various ‘similitudes’ developed in Christian tradition for accounting for the Triune God (psychological and communitarian, social, or ecclesial ‘similitudes’) are relativized: none of them can pretend to be the exact representation of the unity of God the Trinity (see, in this volume, the contributions of Risto Saarinen and Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt). This reserve likewise concerns the Trinitarian model that ‘ecclesiologies of communion’ often develop today. The unity of the ecclesial communion is certainly founded on the Trinitarian unity (Forte 2001), but in a way that is not univocal</p>
<p class="calibre1">—unless it surrenders to a tritheist myth—because it cannot represent perfectly the divine unity that is above all representation. God's incomprehensibility requires therefore a reflection guided by  <i class="calibre4">analogy</i>. The necessity of analogy asserts itself beyond confessional differences, as Karl Barth bears witness: analogy, which offers a true knowledge of God by rejecting equivocity and by equally avoiding univocity, is the sole option left for speaking properly of God the Trinity (Barth 1975: §27, 224–5). </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, as one can easily ascertain, reflection on analogy is far from finished among theologians. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> Critical biblical exegesis has offered much to the contemporary articulation of Trinitarian theology (notably, a renewed consideration of the historical life and preaching of Jesus, and of the expressions of faith by the early Church), but it has al</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p631"></a><b class="calibre3">Conclusion: Prospects for Trinitarian Theology</b> so rendered the classic syntheses more fragile, by underscoring the plurality of biblical approaches as well as the differences of perspective between holy Scripture and dogmatic formulations. Systematic approaches must always be compared with the results of scientific biblical exegesis; at the same time, biblical exegesis, when it operates in faith, cannot be abstracted from the reception of Scripture by the ecclesial tradition. <b class="calibre3">(p. 603) </b>An important task here is to show the continuity between holy Scripture and the dogma of the Church (creeds of Nicaea and Constantinople), without minimizing however the differences of perspectives, concepts, symbols, and vocabulary between the New Testament and the creeds. This task has already been undertaken (see especially Levering 2004), and it needs to be continued. At stake here is the permanent requirement of verifying the biblical foundation of the doctrine of the Trinity. Trinitarian theology has need of constant biblical ressourcement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> The recent development of Trinitarian theology has benefited greatly from the progress of historical studies. These historical studies, as evidenced by sections II, III, and IV of this Handbook, show not only the evolution of thought but also the variety of approaches to the same faith by authors from the same epoch. There is not  <i class="calibre4">a</i> patristic doctrine, but a  <i class="calibre4">plurality</i> of patristic approaches in the unity of the same faith. Likewise, the reception of the patristic inheritances by the medieval tradition manifests an extraordinary diversity (for the syntheses of the golden age of the Latin scholasticism, see especially Friedman 2010), often less well known than that of the Fathers of the Church and whose richness has only begun to be discovered (see, in this volume, the contributions of Lauge Nielsen, Dominique Poirel, Joseph Wawrykow, Russell Friedman, and Karl Christian Felmy). This contribution of patristic and medieval thought cannot be simply ranged among the optional accessories of the past. Reflection on God the Trinity must continue to seek a fruitful relationship between our contemporary thought and the riches of the patristic and medieval theological tradition. This theological claim is rooted in the fact that today's Church, despite the significant cultural changes, shares one faith with the Fathers and medievals. This unity is perhaps more difficult to express today than is the diversity, but it is the unity that enables us to apprehend the value of the diversity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(5)</b> Among the urgent tasks today, one of the most important is showing  <i class="calibre4">the unity of</i> <i class="calibre4">Christian theology</i> in light of faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It is necessary to make manifest the ‘ <i class="calibre4">connexio mysteriorum</i>’, that is to say the intrinsic connection of Trinitarian faith with all the domains of theology: Christology, the doctrine of creation, anthropology, ethics, ecclesiology, sacramental theology, liturgy, ecumenism, theology of the religions, eschatology. This connection is not a one-way street (the ‘diffusion’ of the mystery of the Trinity in all the other domains of theology) but it is reciprocal (the consequences of other domains of theology for Trinitarian doctrine). The enquiry should be one of mutual enrichment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(6)</b> Another fundamental task is that of a mutual enrichment between  <i class="calibre4">spiritual life</i> and Trinitarian doctrine (see, in this volume, the contributions of Daniel Keating, Romanus Cessario, Amy Laura Hall, and Francesca Aran Murphy). Such was the initial goal of Karl Rahner: (re-)shaping the religious life of Christians in Trinitarian fashion. In order to realize this objective, it is undoubtedly helpful to observe the exam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p632"></a><b class="calibre3">Conclusion: Prospects for Trinitarian Theology</b> ple of the pro-Nicene Fathers (St Augustine for example) who understood Trinitarian theology as an ‘exercise’ ( <i class="calibre4">exercitatio</i>) of spiritual purification—an exercise in which the effort to understand the faith is practised within  <b class="calibre3">(p. 604) </b>the movement of conversion and the quest for union with God the Trinity (Ayres 2004: 325–35; Studer 1998: 16–19; Studer 1999: 291–310; Studer 2005: 59–84). The understanding and practice of Trinitarian theology as a ‘spiritual exercise’ is also found among medieval theologians (Emery 2007: 49–72). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(7)</b> The importance of  <i class="calibre4">philosophy</i> remains equally central. The task here is to identify and discern the philosophical tools appropriate for giving an account of the faith (Morerod 2006). Trinitarian theology cannot renounce its speculative dimension. Karl Barth bears witness to this by his effort to re-enliven the theology of the immanent Trinity, in order to show the lordship and liberty of God in his revelation. If Trinitarian doctrine wishes to retain an audience as universal as possible, it cannot give up a firm commitment to rationality. The manifestation of the faith requires a twofold coherence: an internal coherence, which manifests the intelligibility of the mystery of the Trinity to believers; and an external coherence, which is addressed to a broader audience. In addition, Trinitarian theology cannot be content with a mere opportunism with respect to the available philosophies. It must discern the conceptual tools adapted to its object. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(8)</b> Lastly, as the extension of the preceding reflections, it is necessary to point out that today the  <i class="calibre4">metaphysical</i> explication of the Trinitarian mystery is little developed, for reasons that are as philosophical as they are theological. The necessity of an economic approach to the Trinity is unanimously recognized, but the same does not hold for the immanent Trinity (or, if one prefers, the mystery of the Trinity in its inner life). As Jeffrey Hensley rightly observes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the renaissance of trinitarian reflection during the last half-century of Christian theology, the doctrine of the immanent Trinity—God's triune being <i class="calibre4">in se</i> as distinct from God's acts or operations  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>—has suffered significant neglect. Following Karl Rahner's now famous axiom that the ‘economic’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinity is the ‘immanent’ Trinity and the ‘immanent’ Trinity is the ‘economic’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinity, contemporary theologians have focused primarily on the economy of salvation as the means by which God's triune being is known. (Hensley 2008: 83)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Speculative accounts of the inner life of God (‘speculative’ in the sense of ‘contemplative’) have often been eschewed. If contemporary reflection wishes to preserve the riches of the dogmatic tradition and render account of the faith in all its depth, a serious consideration of the immanent Trinity and of the contribution of metaphysical thought will prove indispensable. The divine persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, cannot be conceived solely in function of their relationship with the created world. This was already one of the fundamental stakes of the first Council of Nicaea—which has lost none of its contemporaneity: Page 5 of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p633"></a><b class="calibre3">Conclusion: Prospects for Trinitarian Theology</b> a reflection and a discourse on the Trinity in its inner life is necessary for safeguarding faith in the action of the divine persons for us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Readers will profitably consult this Handbook for authoritative treatments of diverse topics. But it is our particular hope that this Handbook, through its various biblical, historical, and systematic approaches, prepares the reader to undertake the above eight  <b class="calibre3">(p. 605)</b> tasks that—certainly among others—stand at the centre of Trinitarian theology today. In this way our Handbook, in all its diversity, contributes distinctly to the vocation of Trinitarian theology, that is, to the contemplation of the mystery of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in order to better proclaim and live the mystery of faith today. </p>
