  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">It is generally well known that in the Old Testament the creative and ordering power of the God of Israel was frequently rendered with metaphorical dexterity—spoken of as Word or Wisdom as, for example, in Prov. 8:22—and that this way of speaking of God's relation to the world became quite common around the time of the New Testament. Hebrews may well owe much to this way of thinking about God, but the letter also moves in a profoundly new direction, namely, that ‘the Son’ is not at all to be understood in a purely noetic sense. The Son of Hebrews, that is, is not a metaphorical way of speaking about God's mediated relation to the world, a kind of grammatical holding place that gestures toward the fact that the true, high God could never come directly into contact with the material realm. Indeed, Hebrews is resolute in affirming the Son's human life. The Son we hear of as  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> in Heb. 1:8 is none other than the Jesus we hear of in Heb. 2:9: ‘But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one’. That the suffering and death was that of a real human, moreover, is made clear on page after page of the letter. Jesus the Son partook of the ‘same nature’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">that other human beings have—that is, flesh and blood (Heb. 2:14)—and he was tempted in precisely the same way that other humans are (which is why he is able to aid them in their temptations; Heb. 2:18;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 4:15). He was the ‘pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God’ (Heb. 12:2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is this human life of the Son to which the statements in Heb. 1:5–6 make reference: For to which one of the angels did God ever say, ‘You are my Son, today I have begotten you’? Or again, ‘I will be a Father to him and he will be a Son to me’? And when he brought the Firstborn into the life of the world ( <i class="calibre4">oikoumenē</i>), he says, ‘Let all the angels of God worship him’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heb. 1:5–6 does not deny, that is, that the Son is eternally  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> but instead speaks from the perspective of post-resurrection knowledge about the entrance of the Son into the life Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> of the world in the person of Jesus. The ‘begetting’ of the Son, that is, does not point to the  <i class="calibre4">creation</i> of the Son but to the beginning of his human life in the human realm, or  <i class="calibre4">oikoumenē</i> (or perhaps, if the author of Hebrews indeed knows the traditions surrounding Jesus’ baptism, it speaks of the beginning of Jesus’ ministry). Even in his earthly life the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Firstborn’—a reference to Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, not his creation (cf. Rom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8:29; Col. 1:15, 18; Rev. 1:5)—can be worshipped by the angels. In short, the figure of Jesus is the Son whom God is—both in himself and in his creating and redeeming relation to the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That the Son is internal to the identity of God is at bottom what differentiates him from the angels. Modern readers might be perplexed by the amount of energy the author of Hebrews expends to distinguish the Son from the angels. But in fact, as Athanasius saw so clearly in his own way in the fourth century, the question that lies behind such a focus goes to the heart of God's identity. If God is the God of Israel, and if God's Son is  <b class="calibre3">(p. 47)</b> Jesus the human being, why then—a good Jewish theologian should ask—can the Son be worshipped? How is this worship of the Son not idolatry? Is this not an affront to the one and only true God? Hebrews’ way of navigating this basic question is through a grammar of contrast: Jesus should not be conceived as, or in analogy to, an angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hebrews develops this contrast already in the opening of the letter: the Son has become </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘as much superior to the angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs’ (Heb. 1:4). The contrast is then deepened by citing a variety of Old Testament texts, all of which are intended to emphasize the difference between the Son and the angels: ‘Of the angels [God] says, “Who makes his angels winds and his servants flames of fire”. But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever” ’; and, later, ‘But to which one of the angels has he said, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”. Are not all [the angels] ministering spirits who are sent forth to serve those who will inherit salvation’ (Heb. 1:13–14;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 1:5–6). Thus it is no less than God himself who declares through Scripture the Son's superiority to the angels. And yet—</p>
<p class="calibre1">in view of the use of Ps. 44:7 in Heb. 1:8—it would be more precise to say that God declares his own superiority to the angels in the person of the Son. God does not, that is, declare the superiority of something other than God but speaks of himself as  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> in the figure of Jesus the Son. As the text of Hebrews would have it, ‘Son’ is thus internal to the meaning of ‘God’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, in the theology of Hebrews ‘God’ is not collapsed into ‘Son’ or ‘Jesus’ any more than it excludes them. That is to say, ‘God’ is sufficiently relational in its meaning to require of the reader nimbleness in thought, a movement between selfsameness and difference. To put it in the terms of Hebrews, the Son can both be called  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> and ‘have’ a  <i class="calibre4">theos</i>. In the very same citation of Psalm 44 where the Son is clearly called ‘God’, to take only the most striking example, we learn that ‘God’ is not reducible to the Son. Addressing the Son, Heb. 1:8–9 continues, ‘You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; for this reason God,  <i class="calibre4">your God</i>, has anointed you’ ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. the expressions in Heb. 1:3; 2:17; 10:12; 12:2; Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> 13:20, etc.). Even within one citation, therefore, ‘God’ ( <i class="calibre4">theos</i>) is both the Son and yet not reducible to the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or again, if we ask who the  <i class="calibre4">kyrios</i> is in Hebrews, ‘the Lord’ is both Jesus the human being and the God of the Old Testament. Not only does Heb. 7:14 speak of Jesus clearly as ‘the Lord’ who was descended from Judah ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Heb. 13:20), in Heb. 1:10–12 it is no less than God himself who addresses the Son as ‘Lord’ through an Old Testament text in which <i class="calibre4">kyrios</i> originally referred to the God of Israel: ‘You, O Lord [ <i class="calibre4">kyrie</i>], did found the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands’ (Ps. 101:25ff., LXX). Yet in the citation of Ps. 110:4 in Heb. 7:21 and elsewhere ‘the Lord’ is clearly the God of Israel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Heb. 8:8, for example, Jeremiah 31 is cited with the characteristic ‘says the Lord’, which plainly refers to God. Were we to attempt to assign one meaning of  <i class="calibre4">kyrios</i> to Jesus and another to God, we would have already dismantled the language through which Hebrews presents God/the Lord and, therefore, moved away from the theological pattern created by Hebrews’ continuous attempt to speak of the Old Testament God and of Jesus together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 48) </b>Hebrews mentions the Holy Spirit only seven times (Heb. 2:4; 3:7; 6:4; 9:8, 14; 10:15, 29). Yet it does so in a way that makes clear the relational determination of the Spirit's identity. Speaking of the nature of salvation, the author of Hebrews says, ‘It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will’ (Heb. 2:3–4). Here the Spirit is explicitly described as God's Spirit—the Spirit's gifts are distributed according to God's will—and tied to the salvific life of Jesus (the Lord). To speak of the Holy Spirit, therefore, is also to speak of God and of the Lord Jesus ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. the context in Heb. 6:4 and 10:29). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the Holy Spirit cannot be reduced to a simple metaphorical way to speak about God's presence, as if using Spirit language were but another way to speak of God's immanence. The Spirit in Hebrews is rather the one through whom Christ offered himself to God. As the author argues  <i class="calibre4">a minore ad maius</i>: ‘For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ—who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God—purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God’ (Heb. 9:13–14). Or again, Hebrews clearly portrays God as the one who provides the voice of Scripture, but no less do we find the Spirit performing the same task</p>
<p class="calibre1">—indeed, with the same basic scriptural text:</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying, ‘This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws on their hearts and write them on their minds’, he then adds, ‘I will remember their sins and misdeeds no more’. (Heb. 10:15–17, citing Jer. 31:33–4;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. the speech of the Holy Spirit in Heb. 3:7)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> As will be obvious to any reader, the letter to the Hebrews employs a highly complex theological grammar primarily because Hebrews speaks of God in ways that simultaneously maintain and extend the discourse of the Old Testament. ‘God’ is none other than the God of the Old Testament, and yet this God is described also in relation to a human Son that is internal to his eternal identity—Jesus the Christ—and in relation to the Holy Spirit. Moreover, in its defence of the propriety of Jesus worship (esp. chs. 1–2), Hebrews reveals a sense of the profound questions that surround its extension of the Old Testament's theological discourse to a ‘flesh and blood’ human being. To speak of the Old Testament  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> and Jesus  <i class="calibre4">anthropos</i> together (Ps. 44:7; Heb. 1:8) is already to effect a dramatic revaluation of both terms. And to tie inextricably the Spirit of God to the self-offering of Jesus is yet again to revalue the meaning of Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hebrews does not itself so much articulate this revaluation as presuppose it. Later doctrinal language—Trinitarian reasoning, to be precise—developed the interconnection between the relation of the terms that Hebrews presupposes for its particular theological grammar. Hebrews’ grammar, that is, becomes intelligible in light of a larger linguistic range that allows one to say God and Jesus and Spirit together. In this way, Trinitarian doctrine explicates the intelligibility of the particular theological lan <b class="calibre3">(p. 49) </b>guage of Hebrews no less than it creates an exegetical perception of ‘God’ in the text itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Pauline Epistles</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As New Testament scholars have long emphasized, the letters by or attributed to the Apostle Paul are occasional documents. They are not systematic treatises aimed at the elucidation of the whole of the Christian faith. They are—with only one real possible exception (Romans)—written as ‘words on target’, pastoral responses to the particular problems and questions of early Christian congregations. Because of their character, it is an entirely unexceptional fact that the Pauline texts do not contain long discourses on the nature of God, person of Christ, and so forth. This is exactly what one would expect in occasional, pastorally-targeted letters. However, it does not follow from the absence of such direct discourse that one can understand Paul quite apart from thinking through the theological judgements that form the possibility of several of his particular formulations. Indeed, to attend carefully to the grammar of the occasion is immediately to perceive the larger syntax in which the theological logic of such particular formulations is made possible. With respect to the view of God found in the Pauline epistles, Trinitarian reflection is the larger theological syntax that illumines and—ultimately—renders intelligible Paul's particular grammatical moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously the Pauline corpus is too vast to survey in this article. We shall therefore select only four instances from across the corpus that will serve to establish paradigmatically the theological point of view from which the identity of God should be seen when thinking through the witness of the Pauline letters. These four instances are not chosen, however, because they are unusual (and therefore particularly interesting to academics) but pre</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> cisely because they are typical of the theological grammar of the Pauline corpus as a whole (and therefore all the more important). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1</b> <b class="calibre3">Corinthians 12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In chapter 12 of 1 Corinthians Paul begins to admonish the Corinthians for their misunderstanding of the importance of spiritual gifts. The Church in Corinth, it is well known, had an abundance of those who spoke in tongues, prophesied, and so forth. The question thus arose as to how the manifestation of the true (Holy) Spirit should be differentiated from its counterfeits (‘spirits’). Paul instructs the Corinthians: ‘I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says, “Jesus be damned!”; and, no one can say “Jesus is Lord!” except by the Holy Spirit’ (1 Cor. 12:3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is initially intriguing about Paul's argument is that it does not argue for discerning the true Spirit by giving the Corinthians an extensive check-list of things that the Holy Spirit would or would not do through the Corinthians (scream profanity incoherently, foam at the mouth, attack people, and so on). He names only one thing, though of course it has both a negative and positive side: the Spirit never testifies to the permanent death of Jesus but, entirely to the contrary, leads one to confess that Jesus is Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 50) </b>At its deepest level, the argument is that to know the manifestation of the true Spirit is to know the relational determination of the Spirit's identity. Such determination is by God on the one hand and Jesus on the other: God's Spirit is the one who enables the confession that the Lord is Jesus. Paul does not, of course, specify the proper method by which to construe this relational identity in any overtly metaphysical way. But he does say rather clearly that the way to differentiate the true from the false is to see the connection of the Holy Spirit to God the Father and Jesus the Lord. The Spirit of God, that is, cannot be abstracted from Jesus Christ. As Paul will later say, the Corinthians are baptized by the Spirit into one body (which of course is Christ; 1 Cor. 12:12ff.). In 1 Cor. 12:4–6 this relational determination of God's identity is expressed in a neat parallelism: There are varieties of gifts—but the same Spirit ( <i class="calibre4">to auto pneuma</i>) There are varieties of service—but the same Lord ( <i class="calibre4">ho autos kyrios</i>) There are varieties of working—but the same God ( <i class="calibre4">ho autos theos</i>) Again, Paul's argument is not actually  <i class="calibre4">about</i> God's relational identity. It is about how to know the true Spirit and the proper place and worth of spiritual gifts in Christian community. Yet God's relational identity is the ground upon which this argument is constructed, which is to say that the Trinitarian pattern of speech is the linguistic fundament of Paul's particular appeals. One can, of course, conceive of other ways in which he could make the same argument. But that is to miss the point (as hypotheticals often do). The point is rather that when attempting to shape the communal life of the Corinthians vis-à-vis the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, Paul draws upon a theological language that positions the Holy Spirit in relation to the ‘same Lord’ and ‘same God’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> Of course, when ‘Lord’ refers to Jesus, to say ‘same Lord’ and ‘same God’ almost in the same breath is to speak idolatrous nonsense—unless the referents of the words ‘Lord’ and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God’ are to be understood in a noncompetitive manner. And, indeed, Paul's argument gives us no reason to suspect that Lord competes with God. It is rather the case that Paul's seamless theological grammar requires us to think in terms of a reciprocally determining identity between the Lord and God. Differently said, while in the Old Testament the question of competition between God and the Lord could never arise—the Lord was simply God, and vice versa—Paul's language extends the referent of ‘the Lord’ to include Jesus in such a way as to condition what we mean when we now say ‘God’. In brief, Paul's argument presupposes a linguistic interconnection between God, Jesus the Lord, and the Holy Spirit such that to speak of one is necessarily to invoke or imply the others. As Paul himself puts it: no one can confess that Jesus is Lord except by the power of God's Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To receive such speech—to understand the theological possibility of the grammar—is already to reason in a Trinitarian pattern of thought. In this way, Trinitarian reasoning articulates theologically the ground of the text's grammatical moves and really is, therefore, the deeper presupposition of the particular Pauline argument in 1 Corinthians 12. That this is not an isolated instance but constitutive of Pauline argumentation as a whole could be easily shown from a variety of texts (e.g. 1 Cor. 2:2–5; 2 Cor. 13:13(14); Gal. 3:1–5; Phil. 3:3, etc.). Due to the necessary brevity of our reflection, however, we shall illustrate the material continuity with 1 Corinthians 12 by three further examples, each one of <b class="calibre3">(p. 51) </b>which is selected from a major textual area in the Pauline corpus (the  <i class="calibre4">Hauptbriefe</i>, the deutero-Pauline letters, and the Pastoral Epistles). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Romans 5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning first to Romans, we can see several different places where a Trinitarian pattern of speech is employed (e.g. chs. 3, 9–11, etc.). A rather striking instance occurs in Rom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5:1–11, where Paul describes God's reconciling work. Commentators have long noticed that chapter 5 begins another major section in Paul's argument. Having established that justification occurs through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ (chs. 1–4), Paul now begins to describe such justification as ‘peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ’ (5:1). Of course, for Paul, peace in its Christian sense is not opposed to suffering; indeed, suffering provides the occasion for Christian hope (5:2–3). And hope ‘does not disappoint us because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us’ (5:5). God's love is not a fickle declaration that can be given and taken away again, but is displayed in the fact that Christ in fact ‘died for us while we were yet sinners’. We can rejoice, therefore, ‘in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation’ (vv. 6–11). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here Paul does not argue for the truth of a Trinitarian way of speaking about reconciliation and the form of Christian life it commends. Instead, as in 1 Corinthians 12 and elsewhere, Paul's hermeneutical moves presuppose a fundamentally Trinitarian pattern. The way to articulate reconciliation theologically, that is, includes a reference to God the Father (with whom we now have peace, whose love is given to us, etc.), the Lord Jesus Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> Christ (through whom we have been given such gifts), and the Holy Spirit (through whom such gifts are spiritually efficacious, ‘poured into our hearts’). What argumentative logic we can detect in this portion of Romans thus rests more basically upon the linguistic ability to speak of the reconciling act of ‘God by the death of his Son’ in relation to the Holy Spirit's work in forming Christian life. The entirety of Paul's language about reconciliation in Rom. 5:1–8 requires a Trinitarian grammar for its intelligibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Ephesians 4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The so-called deutero-Pauline epistles are no less indebted to a Trinitarian grammar for their theological language than are the Pauline letters proper. Ephesians 4, for example, in which Paul urges the Ephesians toward Christian unity, couches its plea in an appeal to the unity of God himself. The Ephesians should ‘maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace’; for ‘there is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling: one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all, who is over all and through all and in all’ (Eph. 4:3–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is remarkable that, in an attempt to ground Christian unity—one faith, one baptism—in the unity of God, Paul's language moves seamlessly between ‘one Spirit’, ‘one Lord’, and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘one God’. The implication of such language is that the Spirit, Jesus the Lord, and God the Father constitute the unity of God that makes intelligible Paul's exhortation. To embody unity in the life of the Church is precisely to display the unity of the Spirit, Jesus the Lord, and God the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 52) </b>But, once again, the argument at this point in Ephesians presupposes rather than argues for a Trinitarian pattern when speaking of the unity of God. Paul does not, that is, argue one way or another about how Jesus’ identity as Lord does not threaten the Lord God the Father; it is simply assumed in the course of the chapter that the theologically proper way to admonish the Ephesians toward unity is to speak of the unity of God—and this with the language of Spirit, Jesus the Lord, and God the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Titus 3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The short letter to Titus is striking for its focus on salvation (e.g. 1:3, 4; 2:10, 11, 13; 3:4, 5, 6). For the purposes of this essay the most important aspect of this focus can be seen through the fact that if one were to ask, ‘who is the Saviour?’ the theological grammar of Titus would require us to answer at once both God and Jesus. After first speaking of God in 1:4 as ‘God our Saviour’, the letter moves only a sentence later to speak of Jesus as </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘our Saviour’: ‘Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour’ (1:4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 2:10 the reader hears again of ‘God our Saviour’ and then immediately learns—in the same Greek sentence—of the work of ‘our Saviour Jesus Christ’ (2:13). And in 3:4 God is </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘our Saviour’ just as in 3:6 it is Jesus Christ ‘our Saviour’: ‘When the goodness and loving kindness of God our Saviour appeared, he saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour’ (vv. 4–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> Attending to the language of salvation in Titus thus discloses a necessity to speak of God the Father and Jesus Christ together in one breath as ‘the Saviour’. So doing extends the Old Testament's soteriological language about the God of Israel to Jesus Christ. The ‘Saviour God of Israel’ (Isa. 45:15) has become God/Jesus Christ our Saviour. Moreover, at least in vv. 4–6, the connection between God the Saviour and Jesus Christ the Saviour is the Holy Spirit: the Spirit is the way in which God's loving and merciful good work in Jesus Christ is mediated to the Christian community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As in the other New Testament examples above, the letter to Titus does not actually argue for the legitimacy of the new theological grammar. The legitimacy is rather presupposed. It is in fact the foundation upon which Titus explicates the various facets of salvation for its readers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking Hebrews and the Pauline corpus together, we can discern several common themes that together emphasize toward the hermeneutical importance of Trinitarian reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, as in all the texts of the New Testament, both the Pauline letters and Hebrews presuppose that the referent of the common noun ‘God’ is the God of the Old Testament. The letters’ arguments and exhortations, that is, are not constructed on a general or amorphous theological basis but are instead the quite particular outworking of the God of Israel's salvific self-disclosure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, the explicitly theological language employed in the passages considered above forms a single linguistic skein: to remove either ‘Jesus Christ’ or the ‘Holy Spirit’ or ‘God’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">from the argument of the passage would not be simply to truncate the strength of the argument—as if Paul's argument in Romans 5 could proceed with reference to Jesus but not to the Spirit. It would rather be to dismantle the sense of the passage as a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 53) </b>whole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The significance of such linguistic unity inheres in the fact that to speak of salvation and of the one who saves requires a theological grammar sufficiently supple to speak of a final unity of identity and act between three distinct ‘persons’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third, as a whole Hebrews and the Pauline letters presuppose rather than argue for any specific Trinitarian judgements. Though it explicitly addresses the question of the worship of the Son, even Hebrews does not engage in a debate about exactly how a ubiquitous God could be localized in a particular human being, how Creator and creature could coexist in one life, how the Son of God could actually die, and so forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such presupposition is significant precisely because it manifests a pattern of speaking that Trinitarian reasoning later uncovers. Or, to put it more precisely, the reciprocally interpreting and overlapping ways to speak truly about the one God of Israel constitute the theological ground of the biblical texts’ linguistic freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As this brief survey of Hebrews and Pauline texts suggests, attending carefully to the linguistic pattern of the texts’ speech about God requires us to look behind the actual argu</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 13 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Letters of St Paul and Hebrews</b> ments of the texts to the theological judgements that make such language possible. To put it simply: the sense that the New Testament language makes depends upon a larger pattern of theological judgements that makes the sense. This larger theological pattern of sense-making is precisely what we call Trinitarian reasoning. To speak in the manner of Hebrews and the Pauline letters is already to presuppose a Trinitarian range of linguistic possibilities vis-à-vis the identity of God. In just this way, Trinitarian reasoning proves to be exegetically illuminating—indeed, the requisite theological language by which to receive Scripture's grammatical moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be clear: such exegetical illumination occurs not because the conceptual apparatus of the author of Hebrews or the Pauline texts was outfitted with ideas that were still two or three centuries in the future. Finitude—in intellectual terms, the intractable historicity of our reflection—conditioned the authors of Scripture, as it does all human enquiry. It is rather because Trinitarian judgements about the identity of God underlie the intelligibility of the linguistic patterns of the texts. Trinitarian reasoning works on the level of what must be the case to make theological sense of the way Paul and Hebrews speak of the Old Testament God's salvific act in Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. Precisely for this reason, to read Scripture within a Trinitarian framework of theological understanding is to move within the deep theological pattern of thinking that Scripture itself requires. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article analyzes the concept of Trinity in the synoptic gospels of the Books of Gospels and Acts in the New Testament. It points out that the God and Father of Jesus Christ is the one God of Israel, the Creator who chose Israel and promised to restore her to holiness. It explains that the synoptic Gospels include Jesus within the divine name and attribute to him the divine power of electing and forgiving, as well as pre-existence, although the synoptic Gospels also indicate that the Son receives everything from the Father. It argues that the particular focus of the Synoptics is that of the accomplishment of the Father's plan of redemption in the death and resurrection of the Son. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE Gospels are narrative testimony to God's saving action in Christ, with the Synoptic Gospels focusing in particular on easter and eschatology. Given their loosely biographical character, they focus overwhelmingly on the person of Jesus, a proportion which will to a large extent be mirrored in the present chapter. If one were writing about the Trinity in Genesis, for example, one might well venture out from a different starting point and have a differently proportioned account. In the first place, then, we will begin with what is clear from the Synoptic Gospels about the person of the Son, and proceed from there to the Father and the Spirit. We will then use Acts to fill out further the discussion of the Spirit and his Trinitarian relations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This chapter will approach the subject matter in a literary-theological manner, focusing on the ideas explicit or implicit in the four books under discussion here. There will be no diachronic discussion of any possible developments or evolutions which may have underlain the composition of the Gospels or Acts. Similarly, there will be no attention to any dis</p>

<p class="calibre1">It must be remembered that the present chapter is dealing with four fragments of the canonical witness. This pragmatic portioning of the material is of course to some extent artificial. Nevertheless, it is heuristically useful to identify what the particular books of the canon contribute to the doctrine of the Trinity; on the other hand, no book of the New Testament is an island complete in itself giving us Father, Son and Spirit ‘consubstantial, coeternal, while unending ages run’. The present study aims to examine what continuities there are between Matthew, Mark, and Luke–Acts on the one hand, and later Trinitarian doctrine on the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 56) 2. </b> <b class="calibre3">The One God of the</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Shema</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is the one God of Israel is both assumed and asserted throughout the Synoptic Gospels and Acts. Clear examples of this come in the references to the  <i class="calibre4">Shema</i>, which begins: ‘Hear, O Israel: YHWH our God,  <i class="calibre4">YHWH</i>  <i class="calibre4">is</i> <i class="calibre4">one</i>’ (Deut. 6:4). Jesus’ interlocutors allude to this  <i class="calibre4">Shema</i>, recited twice-daily according to earliest Rabbinic tradition ( <i class="calibre4">Mishnah Berakhot</i> 1.1–4.1;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 9.5;  <i class="calibre4">Sotah</i> 7.1), in the forgiveness of sins controversy: ‘who can forgive sins except God alone ( <i class="calibre4">lit</i>. “<i class="calibre4">except God-the-one</i>”)?’ (Mk 2:7/Lk. 5:21). The same language is used by Jesus himself in dialogue with the rich young ruler: ‘No-one is good  <i class="calibre4">except God-the-one</i>’ (Mk 10:18/Lk. 18:19). The fact that the same language here is used by both Jesus and his opponents is reflected in a passage which thematizes the  <i class="calibre4">Shema</i>: One of the Scribes came and heard them debating. Seeing that Jesus had given them a good answer, the Scribe asked him, ‘Which is the most important commandment of all?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus replied, ‘The most important is: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.” The second is this: “Love your neighbour as yourself.” No other commandment is greater than these.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Scribe said to him, ‘Finely said, teacher. You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God’. (Mk 12:28–34a)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In his reference here to the  <i class="calibre4">Shema</i>, Jesus does not break off at the end of Deut. 6:4, but passes from the monotheistic formula to its ethical reflex, namely absolute devotion to the one God: loyalties need not and must not be divided among a pantheon of deities. Instead, Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">‘you shall love YHWH your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength’ (Deut. 6:5). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The significance of this is not merely for the unity of God, but also that references to this one God in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts carry with them the whole characterization of God in the Old Testament. This one God is the creator of all things, the God who established a covenant with Noah for the preservation of creation (Genesis 9) and with Abraham and his descendants for the blessing of the nations (Genesis 15). This God chose Israel, and redeemed her from Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Thereafter, God gave the Torah, and even after Israel broke the Sinai covenant, God promised to restore her at the end of days. Along the way, we also find poetic expressions of the traditional, more abstract divine attributes of omnipotence (e.g. Job 42:1–2), omnipresence (e.g. Ps. 139:7–12), and omniscience (e.g. 1 Sam. 2:3; 2 Sam. 14:20). The book of Exodus additionally has two special ‘self-identifications’ of God: And he said, ‘I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’ And Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God …  <b class="calibre3">(p. 57) </b>And Moses said to God, ‘Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, “The God of your fathers has sent me to you”, and they ask me, “What is his name?” Then what shall I say to them?’ God said to Moses, ‘ <i class="calibre4">I will be who I be</i>. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: “<i class="calibre4">I will be</i> has sent me to you” ’. (Exodus 3:6, 13–14)</p>
<p class="calibre1">And YHWH passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, ‘YHWH, YHWH, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation’. (Exodus 34:6–7) These various characterisations draw attention to God's nature, to his identity, and to his action. As such, discussion of ‘divinity’ in the New Testament should not be dealt with  <i class="calibre4">in</i> <i class="calibre4">abstracto</i> but concretely in relation to the portrayal of  YHWH, the one God of Israel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Divine Son</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a happy circumstance that there has been something of a drift in the past generation of scholarship on the Gospels. This drift—it is probably not quite a shift—has consisted in a movement away from reading the Jesus of the Gospels as merely an  <i class="calibre4">agent</i> of God or a human-messianic figure, and towards understanding him as a more clearly divine figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martin Hengel, in a blurb on the first edition of Larry Hurtado's  <i class="calibre4">One God, One Lord</i>, even spoke of a ‘new “Religionsgeschichtliche Schule” ’ responsible for this new direction (Hurtado 1988). Some of the most important work has been concerned with the evidence from the New Testament more widely, such as Bauckham's essay on the worship of Jesus in the book of Revelation and his and Hurtado's exegetical work on Paul, especially on 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cor. 8:6 and Phil. 2:6–11 (Bauckham 1981 and 2008; Hurtado 1988). These and other Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> scholars, however, have also been responsible for reshaping current views of the Synoptic Gospels and Acts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The humanity of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts is not in question. Matthew's Gospel begins by including Jesus in a genealogy with the titles ‘Son of David, Son of Abraham’ (Matt. 1:1); Jesus is hungry in Matt. 4:2 / Lk. 4:2, and so on. Also emphatic, however, is the way in which Jesus transcends the traditional gulf between God and humanity. We will sketch this through examination of three areas: Jesus’ sharing the name of God, the actions of Jesus as uniquely divine actions, and the responses to Jesus as responses to God or claims to divine identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Jesus’ Sharing the Name of God</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One development introduced into New Testament Christology by Bauckham in particular has been a movement away from two previously competing ways of construing Christology. Traditionally, one might say that much Christological reflection has been concerned with defining how Jesus shares in the divine essence. New Testament  <b class="calibre3">(p. 58) </b>scholars, however, have often accused such concerns as unhistorical metaphysical speculation. As a result, a good deal of twentieth-century exegesis focused more on  <i class="calibre4">agency</i> or  <i class="calibre4">function</i>, that is, on Jesus’ execution of divine action at the expense of making claims about his  <i class="calibre4">nature</i> (e.g. Cullmann 1963). Bauckham has emphasised as a third way (without pronouncing a plague on both the other houses) the category of ‘identity’ as a means of avoiding the Scylla of anachronistic philosophizing on the one hand and the Charybdis of low Christology on the other. Bauckham's discussion of this has principally been applied to Paul, Revelation, and Hebrews (Bauckham 2008) but it can equally be extended to the Synoptic Gospels (Gathercole 2006: 65–8). Jesus’ sharing the  <i class="calibre4">name</i> of YHWH is a good place to start because a name is so obviously concerned with identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b>  <i class="calibre4">Matthew 28:19</i>. One clear statement of Jesus sharing the divine name in the Synoptics is the great commission: ‘Go, then, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’. As is sometimes noted, the  <i class="calibre4">name</i> here is singular even though it has three owners. Neither Father, Son, nor Spirit exhaust the divine identity; rather each shares it. The three alike are also the reference point of the ritual of baptism, and thus of the salvation and ‘belonging’ of the Christian. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b>  <i class="calibre4">Matthew 7:22; 18:20</i>. In two other places in Matthew we find not the collocation of the Father, Son, and Spirit, but rather the substitution of the name of YHWH with the name of Jesus. This is undoubtedly—to borrow language usually associated with atonement debates—not ‘exclusive substitution’ but ‘inclusive substitution’: in other words, it concerns not the removal of YHWH but the incorporation of Jesus. In these places, Jesus is again the fundamental reference point of particular Christian practices: For wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Matt. 18:20)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast our demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ (Matt. 7:22)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first case, we encounter Jesus as the point of orientation for the whole gathering of the congregation: the Jewish tradition about gathering ‘in the name of heaven’ ( <i class="calibre4">Mishnah</i> <i class="calibre4">Abot</i> 4.11) is taken in a Christological direction in Matthew. The same is true in the case of our second example above. The language of prophesying in the name of YHWH is familiar from Jeremiah (Jer. 11:21; 26:9; 27:15), and perhaps alludes even more strongly to the discussion of true and false prophecy in Deut. 18:18–20: the Sermon on the Mount envisages prophecy (even if in this instance it is not sound) as being uttered in the name of Jesus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Actions of Jesus as Uniquely Divine Actions</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Of various activities of Jesus which could be noted (Gathercole 2006: 54–64, 71–2), two particularly striking examples will be discussed: election and forgiveness. <b class="calibre3">(p. 59)</b> <b class="calibre3">(1)</b>  <i class="calibre4">Matthew 11:27 / Luke 10:22</i>. In the first place, although it is rarely remarked upon, it would probably have evoked awe in the earliest readers of the Gospels to learn that Jesus was the one who exercised election in salvation. This is hinted at in the calling of the disciples, where the choice of twelve indicates a restoration or reconstitution of Israel (Mk 3:13 / Lk. 6:13). Similarly remarkable is the fact that the Son of Man has his own elect angels (Mk 13:27 / Matt. 24:31). The co-ordination of all things having been granted to the Son by the Father, with the Son then having power of election, makes it clear that this is no independent action of the Son; nevertheless, it is a clearly divine—and only divine—action. Following on from this (though only in Matthew) is the striking role which Jesus assigns himself in the construction of the eschatological people of God later on in the Gospel: ‘ <i class="calibre4">I</i> will build  <i class="calibre4">my</i> church’, he says (Matt. 16:18). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b>  <i class="calibre4">Mark 2:1–10 et parr.; Luke 7:49</i>. More commonly discussed as a divine prerogative is the forgiveness of sins: ‘Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralysed man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Son, your sins are forgiven” ’ (Mk 2:5). This statement is variously construed by some scholars as a priestly absolution or a prophetic declaration, but attempts to provide parallels of similar statements made by priests or prophets have not been successful. Rather, the Old Testament presupposes the exclusive role of God as ‘forgiver’: ‘Who is a God like you, who forgives sin and passes over the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?’ He does not stay angry forever but delights to show mercy. (Mic. 7:18) From post-biblical Jewish tradition, Hofius has adduced a parallel from  <i class="calibre4">Midrash Psalms</i>, in which David says to God, ‘No-one can forgive sins but you alone’ (Hofius 2000: 40 n. 21). The implied Christology in Jesus’ statement here may have been lost on some commentators, but it was not missed by Jesus’ audience in this pericope. It is to this audience that we now turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> <b class="calibre3">The Responses to Jesus as Responses to Claims of Divine Identity</b> The rather cumbersome subtitle immediately above reflects the fact that the responses we are dealing with here are not homogeneous; in fact they are in a sense mirror images of one another, namely the responses of worship, and the accusations of blasphemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b>  <i class="calibre4">Mark 2:1–10 et parr.; Mark 14:63–4 et parr</i>. Picking up on the ‘healing of the paralytic’ incident, then, after Jesus’ pronouncement of forgiveness, we see the response of the scribes: ‘Why does this man speak this way? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?’ (Mk 2:7;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Lk. 5:21). There are some charges of blasphemy in early Judaism which are not accusations of encroaching on divine territory (pronouncing the tetragrammaton, for example, in  <i class="calibre4">Mishnah Sanhedrin</i> 7.5). <b class="calibre3">(p. 60)</b> Here in the Gospel incident, however, the response is clearly an accusation precisely of claiming to do what is proper to ‘God alone’. Similarly, in the trial scene, the accusation of blasphemy is most probably a response to Jesus’ claim to a heavenly throne (Mk 14:63–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b>  <i class="calibre4">Matt. 28:17; Lk. 24:52–3</i>. More positively, we can draw attention to incidents where Jesus evokes a response of devotion or even the worship that is due to the one God of Israel. At several points, we see actions indicating respect or reverence (e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mk 1:40, 5:22, 10:17). At the very ends of Matthew and Luke, however, there is clearly more. Matthew has the disciples both doubting and worshipping (pqosjume£m) immediately prior to the great commission (Matt. 28:17)—this after Matthew has highlighted such worship as due to God alone (Matt. 4:10). After the ascension, Luke has an equally strong response from the disciples: in the first place, Luke also reserves the particular worship terminology (again, pqosjume£m) for what is due to God alone ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Acts 10:25–6). Secondly, the disciples’ worship of Jesus is paralleled with their praise to God: ‘And they worshipped him (Jesus), and went back to Jerusalem with great joy. And they went on blessing God continually in the temple’ (Lk. 24:52–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Pre-existence and its Limits</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In some recent theology, pre-existence has not been regarded as integral to the Son's divine identity. It is probable, however, that the Synoptic Gospels presuppose a Christology of pre-existence (Gathercole 2006). The strongest evidence for this is the collection of ‘I have come to … ’ sayings, which assume that Jesus’ entire life and ministry are the purpose of his earthly visit. This is evident in the similar Son of Man sayings in Lk. 19:10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(‘For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost’) and Mk 10:45 (‘For the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many’). Attempts to explain the ‘I have come … ’ formula against a prophetic or messianic background have not proven successful: the closest analogy is in the language used when angels move from the heavenly to the earthly sphere. It is particularly difficult to domesticate to the merely intra-cosmic domain a saying as dramatic as Lk. 12:49: ‘I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> Some more content is given to the doctrine of pre-existence in the Synoptics in Matthew's Gospel, in the cry of lament in Matt. 23:37: ‘Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her—how often have I longed to gather your children, as a bird gathers her chicks under her wings. Yet you have not been willing.’ The ‘how often have I longed’ here seems to presuppose the activity of Jesus in the history of Israel, as—probably—in Jude 5 (where Jesus rescues the people from Egypt) and in 1 Corinthians 10, where Jesus as the rock accompanied the people (10:4) who nevertheless ‘tested Christ’ (10:9). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 61) </b>On the other hand, the idea of pre-existence is neither as prominent nor as extensively defined in the Synoptics as it is elsewhere. There is no sense of the Son as  <i class="calibre4">Schöpfungsmittler</i>, ‘mediator of/in creation’, in the Synoptics, as is clear elsewhere. Jn 1:3, 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cor. 8:6, Col. 1:16, and Heb. 1:2 all clearly state that Christ is an agent with the Father in creation. Again, none of the Synoptic Gospels stresses the coeternity of Father and Son as does the Johannine tradition, where Jesus is ‘with God in the beginning’ (Jn 1:2) and assigned the status of ‘Alpha and Omega’, ‘First and Last’, ‘Beginning and End’ (Rev. 22:13; <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 1:17; 2:8; and Isa. 44:6; 48:12). Nevertheless, reports of the absence of pre-existence in the Synoptics (often because they are being compared unfavourably with John's Gospel) are greatly exaggerated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Son and the Father</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We must also note, however, that although Jesus is clearly presented as sharing the divine identity and divine prerogatives in the Synoptic Gospels, there is also an asymmetry between Father and Son. In Pauline studies, this has been noted in the case of Philippians 2, where every knee bows to and every tongue confesses Jesus ‘to the glory of God the Father’: there is an ultimacy in the glory of the Father before which the worship of Jesus is a theological penultimate. In the Synoptic Gospels, this finds something of an analogue in Matt. 11:27 and 28:18. Both of these statements appear, as we have seen, in the company of passages of unquestionably high Christology, while making explicit the submission of the Son to the Father:</p>
<p class="calibre1">All things have been committed to me by my Father. (Matt. 11:27) Then Jesus came to them and said, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.’ (Matt. 28:18)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first case, Jesus goes on to speak of the exclusive mutual knowledge shared by Son and Father, and of the Son's authority in election; in the second, he has been worshipped in the preceding verse and proceeds to talk of his sharing the divine name in the following. Additionally, in each case, the grant from the Father is limitless—‘all things’, ‘all authority’. There is clearly a distinction made, however, between the giver and the recipient: the Son is not—though here one is treading perhaps on  <i class="calibre4">terra incerta</i>—in and of himself by intrinsic or self-generated power ruler of all. Rather, to borrow the language of Hebrews 1 also employed by the wicked tenants (Mk 12:7 et parr.), he is ‘the heir’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> <b class="calibre3">The Incarnate Jesus and divine attributes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Synoptic Gospels raise most pointedly the tension between Jesus’ divine and human natures. It is of course often asked how a divine Jesus could be ‘hungry’ (Matt. 4:2). Still more difficult is the question of the ignorance of Jesus in Mk 13:32: ‘No one knows about <b class="calibre3">(p. 62) </b>that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If omniscience is an attribute so integral to God, how can Jesus still be divine? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the framework of the Synoptic Gospels, the purpose of God and the will of Jesus are two considerations which help to explain some of the difficulty. The development of the Son of Man theme in Mark's Gospel is a nice illustration of this (Gathercole 2004). Jesus demonstrates early on in Mark the supreme authority of the Son of Man—even over forgiveness and over Sabbath (Mk 2:10, 28). The Son of Man  <i class="calibre4">willed</i>, however, not to  <i class="calibre4">exercise</i> this authority in his earthly ministry: this is a result of the twin facts that—to move to the cluster of Son of Man sayings in the middle of Mark—it is necessary (de£) that he suffer (8:31), and indeed that is his intention in coming (10:45). The divine necessity highlights the Father's purpose; that the Son of Man ‘came not to be served but to serve’ accentuates Jesus’ own willed action coming to expression. In this case, the willed action is negative: it is a decision on the part of the Son not to impose his authority in the course of his earthly ministry. He has not come in this instance to judge, but to save. As a result, it is perhaps more easy to understand why Jesus does not avail himself of the knowledge of when he will come back to judge: it is of no relevance to his present ministry of seeking and saving the lost, and so he does not exercise his will-to-know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This also helps to explain a  <i class="calibre4">crux interpretum</i> in Acts: ‘Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God  <i class="calibre4">has made</i> (©poýgsem) this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ’ (Acts 2:36). It has been noted that while the verb might be open to referring to a confirmation or declaration of an existing reality, it perhaps is a stretch. How then can God's ‘making’ of Jesus to be Lord and Christ be taken as other than adoptionistic? The first point to note is that in Luke's Gospel, Jesus is explicitly designated as both Christ and Lord from the beginning (Lk. 2:11). On the other hand, as was evident from the Son of Man motif in Mark, Jesus was not  <i class="calibre4">exercising</i> his full authority as Lord and Christ in his earthly ministry. There are at least two senses in which Luke is explicit about this. First, Jesus is from the pre-Easter point of view still in the future destined to ‘enter into his glory’ (Lk. 24:26;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 24:46; Acts 3:18; 17:3; 26:23). This ‘entry into his glory’ is of double-edged significance: it means that Jesus is not ‘in glory’ in his earthly ministry; on the other hand it means that it is properly  <i class="calibre4">his</i> glory ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Matt. 25:31; Lk. 9:26, and in the transfiguration at Lk. 9:32). Another important aspect of Jesus’ identity as Lord and Christ which is not yet in view in his earthly ministry is his role as giver of the Spirit, which is central to this pericope in Acts 2 (2:33, 38). Therefore the  <i class="calibre4">appointment</i> at the resurrection in Acts 2 is genuine: Jesus was not appointed in his pre-Easter ministry as the Spirit-giving Lord of glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The episode in the Garden of Gethsemane is sometimes considered difficult because the issue is on the surface precisely with Jesus’ ‘will’ (hœkgla) apparently being opposed to Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> that of the Father (Mk 14:36 and parr.). Without wishing to attempt to eliminate the complexity here, this problem is partly mitigated by the fact that this same statement is Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">declaration that he  <i class="calibre4">does</i> align his decision with that of the Father: ‘not my will but yours be done’. However one defines Jesus’ ‘executive’ moral faculty (it clearly does not correspond to what Jesus calls his hœkgla here)  <b class="calibre3">(p. 63) </b>which adjudicates between the internal desire and the external divine plan, that moral faculty of Jesus ultimately prefers the external divine will. This becomes even more marked when one compares Jesus on this point with the surrounding actors—the disciples whose spirits are willing but whose flesh is weak, as well as Judas and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Son and the Cross</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Synoptic Gospels in particular show pointedly the tension between the heavenly identity of the Son (highlighted in the transfiguration) and his death. Two problems in particular come to the surface here: first, the problem of the  <i class="calibre4">death</i> of the divine Son, and second the apparent  <i class="calibre4">separation</i> of the Father from the Son voiced in the cry of dereliction. It is here, however, that our knowledge is at its most fragmentary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, on the question of the sense in which the Son dies, there is no hint in the Synoptics or Acts that Jesus dies only in his human nature while some other aspect of his identity endures. Luke 23:43's ‘Today you will be with me in paradise’ has been used as evidence that the Son had a continued existence between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, but this is probably to read it too woodenly. The evangelists retain the paradox, expressed in the killing of the Son in the parable of the wicked tenants, and in Peter's statement, ‘you killed the author of life’ (Acts 3:15). The evangelists leave it for later theologians to ask how Jesus can at the same time be the glorious Son of the Father already in his earthly ministry and yet be subject to death. Leaving the theoretical realm, in terms of what  <i class="calibre4">happens</i> to make this death possible, again the  <i class="calibre4">will</i> of Jesus as described in the Gospels perhaps gives a clue. The Son of Man ‘gives his life’ (Mk 10:45): as such, it might be said that the Son's divine will can even be exerted over his life. His freedom extends even over his own existence in the earthly sphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, on the cry of ‘my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ the point at issue is what is meant by this mysterious dereliction: Father and Son, inseparable from eternity, appear divided (Matt. 27:46; Mk 15:34;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Ps. 22:1). Here our knowledge is even more limited, but three observations may be made. In the first place, we may observe that it is precisely in the single event of the Father's judgement and Jesus’ death that their wills are perfectly aligned. Additionally, it is a persistent biblical theme that judgement is not unqualified separation, but rather God's withdrawal of his presence-to-bless. Finally, the judgement, expressed in the Father's turning from the Son, is not ultimate: the fact that Jesus quotes the opening words of Psalm 22, rather than expressing the separation in another manner, implies this, for the Psalm proceeds from despairing abandonment (Ps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">22:1–18) through hopeful pleading (Ps. 22:19–21) to praise for divine deliverance (Ps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">22:22–31). Jesus’ cry of dereliction, then, while a final gasp expressing curse-bearing and judgement on our behalf, is at the same time also the first line of a drama culminating in Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> Jesus’ vindication in the resurrection and triumphal accomplishment of the Father's redemptive plan: as Psalm 22 ends, ‘For he has done it’ (Ps. 22:31). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 64) 4. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Identity and Character of the Father</b> It is perhaps remarkable that the Father is seldom given extensive characterization in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts. On the other hand, we have already discussed the relation between Father and Son, and later will proceed to that of Father, Son, and Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the Son and the Spirit, the Father of course also shares the divine name in the baptismal formula in Matt. 28:19. This is unremarkable: it is not unknown for God to be referred to as Father in the Old Testament (Deut. 32:6; Ps. 89:26; Isa. 63:16; Jer. 3:4, 19; Mal. 1:6; 2:10). The  <i class="calibre4">novum</i> in the New Testament, perhaps, is that the Father does not exhaust the divine identity. In the first instance the Father is unknowable, but he is made known by the Son: ‘nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him’ (Matt. 11:27b). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Sermon on the Mount is perhaps the richest source in the Synoptic tradition for the actions of the Father. He dwells in heaven, and rules his creation in his providence, such that he controls the sun and the rain (Matt. 5:45), feeds birds (6:26), and clothes people (Matt. 6:30 / Lk. 12:28); he forgives (6:14), rewards (6:4), and gives good gifts (Matt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7:11; ‘the Holy Spirit’, in Lk. 11:13). It is striking, although it perhaps should not be, how much the Sermon stresses the Father's  <i class="calibre4">generosity</i>. Luke also twice refers to the gift of the Kingdom by the Father to his ‘little flock’ (Lk. 12:32;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 22:29). The love of the Father is thus strongly in evidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This love begins in the Gospel narrative as the love of the Father for the Son, expressed in declarations at the baptism (‘You are my beloved Son’; Mk 1:11 / Lk. 3:22) and the transfiguration (‘This is my beloved Son’; Mk 9:7 / Matt. 17:5). This is then extended to God's people, seen most graphically in the parable of the lost son (Lk. 15:11–32). As such, the divine plan accomplished by Jesus’ death is no mere mechanical outworking of a purpose, but an expression of the love of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, as in the rest of the New Testament, the end of all things is taken to be the glorification of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Rom. 15:8–9; 1 Cor. 10:31; Eph. 1:6, 12; etc.). One of the goals of discipleship is that this happens in an indirect manner: ‘let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven’ (Matt. 5:16). Disciples are also instructed, however, to pray for it: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name’ (Matt. 6:9 / Lk. 11:2). Acts 2:46–7 defines as characteristic of the earliest Christians that they broke bread together and praised God. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> <b class="calibre3">5. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Spirit and the Son</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In treating the relationship between Spirit and Son, we begin with what one might call actions of the Spirit on the Son. Thereafter, we will continue to Jesus’ role in sending the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 65) The Spirit and the conception of Jesus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The first expression of this relationship which we encounter is in the action of the Spirit in the virginal conception, as expounded by both Matthew and Luke. The two evangelists of the birth both share, interestingly, a curious neuter phrase—well reflected in the literalism of the King James Version's ‘that which is conceived in her’ (Matt. 1:20) and ‘that holy thing which shall be born of thee’ (Lk. 1:35). In addition to this, they share mention of the agency of the Spirit:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because <i class="calibre4">what is begotten in her is from the Holy Spirit</i> (Matt. 1:20b). </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you</i>. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. (Lk. 1:35) What content can be given to the creed's ‘conceived by the Holy Spirit’? Matthew's version emphasizes that the Spirit has, in effect, taken the place of the male role in conception (‘begetting’ in NT language is usually a man's responsibility). The same is also true implicitly in Luke, with the angel's testimony coming in response to Mary saying that she knows not a man. John Owen goes further, however, in theological reflection on this, in his insightful discussion of the Spirit's work in the sanctification of the human nature of Jesus at the conception (Trueman 2007: 94–5): the flow of Luke's statement is certainly open to this interpretation (‘the  <i class="calibre4">Holy Spirit</i> will come upon you … therefore that  <i class="calibre4">holy</i> thing’). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Luke's Gospel, the Spirit of prophecy then animates witnesses to the coming of Jesus, in the cry of Elizabeth (Lk. 1:41–2), in Zechariah's  <i class="calibre4">Benedictus</i> (Lk. 1:67–79), Simeon's <i class="calibre4">Nunc dimittis</i> (Lk. 2:25–32), implicitly in the reaction of Anna (a prophetess, Lk. 2:36–8), and,  <i class="calibre4">in utero</i>, John the Baptist (Lk. 1:41;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 1:15). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Spirit and the ministry of Jesus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">All the Synoptics, indeed all four Gospels ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 1:33) observe that the Spirit alights upon Jesus at his baptism (Mk 1:10 / Matt. 3:16 / Lk. 3:22). Immediately after the baptism, the language of the Spirit's agency is striking: in Mark the Spirit drives Jesus out into the wilderness (Mk 1:12). Matthew and Luke temper this only slightly, speaking of the Spirit </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘leading’ Jesus there (Matt. 4:1; Lk. 4:1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luke's Gospel in particular comments upon Jesus’ activity in the Spirit in his ministry, with the quotation of Isaiah 61 in Lk. 4:18, and the reference to Jesus’ speaking by the Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> Holy Spirit in Lk. 10:21. Matthew, similarly, writes in terms of the anointing of Jesus with the Spirit by the Father leading to Jesus preaching justice to the nations and casting out demons (12:18, 28). This is not developed especially in any of the Synoptic Gospels, however; rather they look forward to Jesus baptizing in the Spirit in the post-resurrection era (Mk 1:8 and parr.): similarly, we probably do not find in the Synoptics and Acts the agency of the Spirit in the resurrection ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Rom. 1:4; 8:11; 2 Tim. 3:16). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 66) 6. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Mission of the Spirit</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the actions of the Spirit above  <i class="calibre4">upon</i> Jesus, the emphasis in the Gospels and Acts is upon the agency of Jesus in sending the Spirit. As has been noted, the main imagery deployed to depict this in the Gospels is ‘baptizing in the Spirit’, although ‘clothing’ language is introduced at the end of Luke, in anticipazion of the ‘power from on high’ to be given at the beginning of the second volume (Lk. 24:49). It is notable that here we have the first hint of double agency in the sending of the Spirit: ‘ <i class="calibre4">I</i> will send upon you what has been promised by my  <i class="calibre4">Father</i>’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Acts of the Apostles, then, identifies the Spirit first as the power enabling the Gospel to move—as is the main thrust of the book—from Jerusalem, through Judaea, to Samaria, and to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). Peter's sermon in Acts 2 develops the theme of the double agency involved in the sending of the Spirit: ‘Having been exalted, therefore, to the right hand of God, he received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, and has poured out what you now see and hear’ (Acts 2:33). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The risen and ascended Jesus, then, by virtue of the  <i class="calibre4">sessio ad dexteram</i>, is granted the Spirit by the Father, and Jesus in turn sends the Spirit upon his people ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 15:24, and Jesus sending the Paraclete ‘from the Father’). Sending usually suggests the authority of the sender over the envoy, and so the fact that Jesus sends and pours out the Spirit also strongly suggests the submission of Spirit to Son ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. e.g. Matt. 8:9 / Lk. 7:8). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">7. </b> <b class="calibre3">Hints of the Personal Agency of the Spirit in</b> <b class="calibre3">Acts</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Acts begins to use personal language to speak of the Spirit, in a way that is clearer in the John's Farewell Discourse. The Spirit talks to people (Acts 8:29; 11:12; 13:2; 21:11; 28:25), can be lied to and tested (Acts 5:3, and 5:9), sends Paul and Barnabas (13:4), warns (20:23) and urges (21:4) Paul, but also on one occasion prevents Paul from travelling (16:6–7). This last passage also joins the Spirit and Jesus: Paul and his companions travelled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, <i class="calibre4">having been kept by the Holy Spirit</i> from speaking the word in the province of Asia. When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to pass into Bithynia, but <i class="calibre4">the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts</b> The glossing of the Holy Spirit (16:6) with the phrase ‘Spirit of Jesus’ (16:7) is interesting both for its implied Christology and its pneumatology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 67) 8. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Personal and Divine Identity of the</b> <b class="calibre3">Spirit in Matthew</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, we should draw attention to the inclusion of the Holy Spirit in the threefold divine name of God invoked in Christian baptism: ‘baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’ (Matt. 28:19). First, this statement identifies the Spirit as personal: the Spirit partakes of a  <i class="calibre4">name</i>. Second, no less than in the cases of Jesus and the Father (as discussed above), the Spirit shares the  <i class="calibre4">divine</i> name. Some of Matthew's earliest second-century readers repeat Matthew 28's ‘Trinitarian’ structure in other contexts ( <i class="calibre4">Didache</i> 7.1,3; Ignatius of Antioch,  <i class="calibre4">Letter to the Ephesians</i> 9.1;  <i class="calibre4">Letter to the Magnesians</i> 13.1,2; Papias, fragment 5 (?);  <i class="calibre4">Gospel of Thomas</i> 44), and indeed similar triadic formulae are already present in other places in the NT (2 Cor. 13:13; Rev. 1:4–5). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">9. </b> <b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Having said in the introduction that we were only dealing with fragments of the canonical witness, these particular fragments have actually produced a good deal of grist to the Trinitarian mill. The personal divine identity of Father, Son, and Spirit expressed in very brief compass in Matt. 28:19 is expanded elsewhere. The divine contours of Jesus’ person are particularly clear in the Synoptic Gospels in actions such as his election and forgiveness of sins, while the Father-Son order of the great commission formula is reflected in the hierarchical submission of Son to Father. The Father is characterized especially by generosity and love, and this is expressed not least in his giving the Spirit to the Son; then the Son in turn gives the Spirit to his people. The particular focus of the Synoptics, however, is that of the accomplishment of Father's plan of redemption in the death and resurrection of the Son, with Acts relating how the Spirit enables this message to be proclaimed in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to all the ends of the earth. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This article examines the concept of the Trinity in the Johannine literature in the New Testament. It argues that John the Apostle does not simply derive his Father language from the Jewish wisdom literature but instead has in view the Son's relationship to his Father. It explains that After the Ascension, the Son's agency on behalf of the Father is continued by the Spirit's agency on behalf of the Father. Thus the Book of Revelation depicts the Father and the Son sitting on the divine throne while the Spirit dwells in the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, John the Apostle, New Testament, Jewish wisdom literature, Ascension, Spirit, Book of Revelation <b class="calibre3">The Fourth Gospel</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE study of the NT doctrine of God has gone through various phases, permutations, and combinations, and none more so than the study of the God language in the Fourth Gospel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from the earliest commentaries on the Fourth Gospel (e.g. Origen's) it was recognized that this Gospel had much more to say about topics as varied as: <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> the pre-existence of the Son of God; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> the deity of the Logos; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> the Incarnation of the Logos; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> the personhood of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, the ante-Nicene Church Fathers realized as well that even in the most theological of Gospels there was not a fully articulated doctrine of the Trinity. Indeed it would be anachronistic to suggest otherwise. What we have in the Fourth Gospel however is the most complete set of raw data from which such a doctrine could be constructed because here the interrelationships between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are given the most fulsome treatment of any NT document. It is not a surprise, then, that it was the Fourth Gospel which provided the major raw materials for much of the constructive theologizing Page 1 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> that went on at Nicaea in ad 325 and then later at Chalcedon in ad 451. It will be appropriate then to explore in some detail some of the theologizing that takes place in the Fourth Gospel itself on this subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The proper place to begin our discussion is with the Father language in the Fourth Gospel. Despite some protests to the contrary, the Fourth Gospel is a Christologically focused book which views the Father through the lens of what the Evangelist believed about the Son. The Father language in the Fourth Gospel does not chiefly arise out of the <b class="calibre3">(p. 70) </b>OT language for God, where God is seldom called Father, and never directly addressed in prayer in that fashion, though a case can be made that some of the early Jewish Wisdom literature had begun to use Father language more frequently of God, a trend which the Fourth Gospel, because of its sapiential character, continues (Witherington 1995). However even this does not explain the enormous use of the term Father for God in the Fourth Gospel. Some 120 times this Gospel refers to God as Father, and some further 108 times the term God is used for this person, but the two terms are basically used interchangeably. This should not surprise us as the author is a Jew. What is surprising is that in addition the Logos is called håo| in Jn 1, and more explicitly the risen Jesus is addressed as ‘my God’ in Jn 20, two of the some seven times Jesus is called ‘God’ in the NT. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the clear evidences that the use of Father language of God in the Fourth Gospel is Christocentric in character is that, as in the Synoptics, the reference to God as Father comes almost solely on the lips of Jesus himself (here Thompson 2000 simply goes awry in suggesting that by ‘Father’ Jesus simply is taking over the OT language about God being the Father of Israel). The clear, almost umbilical connection between the Son and the Father is delineated already in Jn 1:14–18 where Jesus is called ‘monogenes’ or the only natural son of the Father, in contrast to all believers who can become adopted sons and daughters of God by means of being ‘born again’ spiritually. A clear distinction is made between the natural and the adopted offspring of God and we should note that the author is clear that human beings are not born children of God, they must become so through the second birth. The Evangelist's use of Father language is then patterned on Jesus’ in this Gospel where some two dozen times Jesus calls God ‘my Father’ (and no one else does) as well as ‘the Father’ (some 85 times), and simply ‘Father’ or ‘holy Father’ an additional eight times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Son then in this Gospel is said to be ‘one’ with the Father (Jn 10:30) which is not taken to mean that the Son and the Father are the same person, because the two can be distinguished (the Son alone becomes incarnate, dies on the cross, and rises again). It has often rightly been noted as striking that the Son is portrayed as God's agent or apostle on earth, who will not act without the divine approval and authorization, and this dependency of will on the Father is a manifestation of the fact that ‘he who has seen me has seen the Father’ (Jn 14:9), by which is meant the Son shares the same character and nature with the Father and agrees with the will of the Father. Their relationship is characterized as mutual abiding. They are not merely in agreement, they have a unity of character and purpose as well. The same Evangelist who stresses that in order to know who Jesus is, one must know where he has come from (namely from heaven as the divine Logos), is the Evangelist who places strong stress on the humanness of Jesus, who gets thirsty and tired Page 2 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> (Jn 4), or angry (Jn 11), and who manifests a sort of dependency on the Father that can provide a paradigm for his disciples to follow. There is a balance in the portrayal of Jesus as human and yet clearly more than merely mortal. E. Kasemann's old cliché about Jesus bestriding the stage of this Gospel like a god is of course true, but only a part of the truth about the portrayal of the Son in this Gospel. The Incarnation is real: Jesus does not merely appear to be human or pantomime human behaviour, but really tabernacles with humankind in the flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 71) </b>What binds the Christological portrait together in this Gospel is its rich indebtedness to the Jewish wisdom tradition. The portrait of the Logos in Jn 1 is in fact borrowed from the portrait of God's Wisdom in Prov. 3:8–9, Sirach, and Wisdom of Solomon and applied to the Son. In Wisd. 7:22 it was Wisdom that was said to be ‘monogenes’. The personification has become a person on this reading of the Wisdom tradition, but it is by no means just in Jn 1 that this is evident. We could turn to the Son of Man language in the Fourth Gospel which is conditioned by the ascending and descending discussions, both about Wisdom in earlier Jewish literature ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 1 Enoch 42 where Wisdom comes to earth, is rejected, and returns to the Father on high), and about Enoch himself (1 Enoch 70:2; 71:1), and so we hear texts like ‘What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending?’ (like Enoch) or in Jn 7:25–7 where the key to understanding Jesus is knowing his origins in God and also his destiny in returning to God ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 7:35; 8:21–2). In fact throughout this Gospel Jesus assumes the roles normally attributed to Wisdom who is said to provide light (i.e. truth), and life (i.e. salvation), and the path to both ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Prov. 8–9 and Wisd. 10:16). In a very explicit sapiential echo Wisd. 16:6 tells us the snake lifted up in the desert is a sign of salvation, and so in Jn 3:14 the lifting up of the Son on a stake, like the snake, is the sign of salvation in this Gospel. Furthermore, it is Wisdom who is said to perform miracles as signs and foretastes of salvation in Wisdom 10 and 16, just as in the Fourth Gospel. Then too, a close examination of the ‘I am’ sayings in John both in the absolute form and with qualifiers (e.g. ‘I am the light of the world’; see in general Jn 8:24, 28, 58; 13:19; 17:6, 12, 26) equally reflects the indebtedness to the Wisdom tradition, for Wisdom had been called the living bread, the light of the world, the door, the life, the authentic vine (in places like Prov. 3:18, 8:38, 9:5; Wisd. 1–8; Sirach 24). In short the theological vocabulary of this Gospel has had a sapiential makeover, including its soteriological as well as God language (Witherington 1995). </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the discussion of both the Father and the Son in this Gospel is rooted in previous discussions about Wisdom, it will come as no surprise that the developed pneumatological language in this Gospel is also indebted to such patterns of speech. Wisdom 1–4 speaks of Wisdom being a kindly Spirit that inhabits the soul of the king and gives him revelation and understanding. Just as the Son is the agent of the Father on earth, so the Spirit is the agent of the Son on earth, once Jesus departs. There are some Paraclete sayings in the Farewell discourse where Jesus is presented as Wisdom teaching, and the Spirit is presented as Wisdom's substitute teacher (Jn 14:26; 15:26; 16:7–11; 16:12–15). Paqajkœtor means a legal agent or advocate or even counsellor. Note that Jesus promises to send another one like himself, which implies he was the first counsellor or sage or conveyor of authoritative Wisdom. The Spirit is said to have three roles: (1) to indwell the believer Page 3 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> providing divine presence and peace; (2) to teach and lead the believer into all truth; and (3) to enable the disciples to testify and convict, convince, and convert the world. As Jesus plays these roles in relationship to the first disciples and is the Advocate for the Father, so the Spirit plays this role for Jesus and is his Advocate. In short, just as the Farewell Discourses are laden with language that encourages the identification of the Son with Wisdom ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Sirach 4:11–13 to Jn 14–16) such that the Son teaches his children, gives help to those who seek him, and whoever holds fast to Him obtains life, joy, <b class="calibre3">(p. 72)</b> knowledge, glory (Jn 17:22) and thus the Lord loves those who love Wisdom (Jn 17:26) just as was previously said about Wisdom, so going forward the Spirit will play this role once the Son departs (Witherington 1994). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In all of this elevated sapiential discussion the Father, Son, and Spirit are treated as truly divine, giving what only God can give, and are depicted as persons who act in personal ways—loving, leading, teaching, and the like. They act in consort as the agents of human salvation, reflecting that the heart of God is a love for all of his creation, particularly his fallen human creation, for ‘world’ in this Gospel normally refers to fallen humanity organized against God ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 3:16). The relationship of the Son to the Father is analogous to the relationship of the Spirit to the Son in that there is dependency and deference, but also mutual abiding. The Spirit that Jesus breathes on his disciples in Jn 20 is none other than the Spirit of God, the sanctifying and empowering and revivifying Spirit. Less is said in this Gospel about the relationship of the Spirit to the Father than about the other divine relationships, but in part this is because of the Christological focus of this Gospel—</p>
<p class="calibre1">just as the Father is viewed through the lens of the Son, so also the Spirit is viewed through the lens of the Son, the Son being the middle term on all such discussions. The issue of testimony, so important in this Gospel, becomes clearer when seen in this light, as there are always two witnesses to testify on behalf of the other member of the Godhead, verifying what has been said or done by Father, Son, or Spirit. But they do not merely testify as One and to each other, they act in concert. The Son came down from above, and then the Spirit came down from above and dwelt on the Son permanently (Jn 1:33), and then the Son sent the Spirit down from above to dwell on and in the believers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit is the one in charge of the rebirth of all those who would see the kingdom of God, even the Nicodemuses of this world (Jn 3), for the world is literally in the dark, lost, and requires transformation even just to accept the light. Because of the soteriological focus of this Gospel only a little is said about a theology of original creation, but the Incarnation itself implies the ultimate divine imprimatur, the ultimate affirmation of the goodness of flesh, of creation, a theme further developed in the Johannine epistles where it becomes a litmus test for orthodoxy, for it was essential that Jesus Christ come in the flesh, die, and rise again if the Spirit was to be shed abroad and salvation was to come to humankind in general. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sweep of the portrayal of Father, Son, and Spirit is in some respects breath-taking, not just because of the lack of veiledness of Jesus’ messianic character in this Gospel, but equally clearly because of the statements about unity of nature, will, identity of Father, Son, and Spirit, all personal, and all personally engaged in the salvation of the world. The lack of future eschatology in this Gospel is notable (though there are hints—Jn 5:28–9) Page 4 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> but not surprising since the author is stressing that salvation has already arrived in the person of Jesus, and been applied directly and inwardly by his Advocate the Spirit. The biographical genre combined with the sapiential character of this Gospel lent itself to the telling of the part of the story directly related to Jesus’ time on earth, and not its sequel, for when Wisdom returns to heaven after dwelling on earth (1 Enoch 42) she does not return again except in her Spirit. It is no wonder then that the Church Fathers and those who met at the Church councils turned to this Gospel primarily for a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 73) </b>theology of the interrelationships between Father, Son, and Spirit and their relationship with Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">disciples, and the high Christology of this volume, and not for teaching on eschatology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Johannine Epistles</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On first blush, when one turns to the so-called Johannine Epistles (so-called because 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">John is a sermon, not an epistle at all, unlike 2 John and 3 John), one can be forgiven for thinking on first glance that they have little to add to the conversation about the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is in fact false, not least because 1 John in particular has a robust Christology which contributes to the reconfiguration of the God language in these documents, but also because 1 Jn 5:6–12, even without the later added verses 7–8 which are not found in any Greek manuscript before the fourteenth century, add considerably to the discussion of the Trinity. We will work backwards from 3 John to 1 John which not coincidentally is moving from least to most fertile material for our discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whilst 3 John is a short brief that is more like an ancient letter in character and length than any other NT document, it is not without theological content. In verses 6–7 for example we hear about showing hospitality worthy of God, and also about missionary work for the sake of the ‘Name’ which in this case is likely to refer to Christ who now bears the divine name (see similarly Acts 4:17; 5:41; 1 Pet. 4:14–16; James 2:7; Epistle of Barnabas 16:8; Ignatius’ Letter to the Phil. 10:1, and especially Jn 15:21). The word  <i class="calibre4">God</i> in this epistle refers to the Father both in verse 6 and verse 11, and in the latter verse doing what is good is the characteristic of those who are ‘from God’ whilst doing what is evil reveals a person has not seen God. Behaviour not merely reveals belief, it reveals relationship with God or a lack thereof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2 John is a deeper well from which to draw on our subject for several reasons. Firstly grace, mercy, and peace which only God can give is said to come to the believer from both God the Father and from Jesus Christ ‘the Father's Son’. In the proper sense in this document, only Jesus is called God's (non-adopted) Son, though the term ‘monogenes’ is not found here as in Jn 1. The toggling back and forth between the Father and the Son is noteworthy in this letter and it indicates the divinity of them both. It is on the one hand the Father that commanded the Christian believers to walk in the truth (verse 4: ‘he commanded  <i class="calibre4">us’</i>), but true believers are also required to and willingly acknowledge ‘Jesus Christ coming in the flesh’ (verse 7) thereby making clear that Christian belief is not just in the Father but in the Son as well. Furthermore, ‘anyone who … does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God’ (verse 9), but whoever does do so ‘has’ both the Page 5 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> Father and the Son. It's a package deal, and the point of entry for a relationship with the Father is implicitly and exclusively through the Son as is made clear here and in 1 John. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The failure to embrace this teaching is the basis for exclusion from the community, just as embracing it is the basis of inclusion. Christological orthodoxy matters for this writer and it involves and is manifested in orthopraxy as well. Then too at the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 74) </b>outset and conclusion of this document the author speaks of believers being ‘chosen by God’ as is manifested by their love of the truth. It is hard to doubt that the recipients of 2 John and 3 </p>
<p class="calibre1">John had already been the recipients of the much fuller exposition on matters Christological and theological in 1 John, or at least had orally been told such things, for the references to God and Christ in 2 John and 3 John are telegraphic in form, and presume a pre-existing knowledge of what is meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 John is certainly, along with Hebrews and James, an example of early Christian preaching, and its rhetoric is highly theological in character. It begins with an opening salvo about the Word of life which has appeared, and appears to refer to both the person of Christ and the message about him. The Christian  <i class="calibre4">koinonia</i> is said to be with both the Father and his Son. Notice the exclusive relationship between the two—the Father has a Son (singular), not many, and here as elsewhere he is called both Jesus Christ and Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Believers are called children of God instead (1 Jn 3:1–2), because they are born, or better said reborn of God (3:9). But Jesus is also called by another early Jewish title in this sermon, ‘the Righteous One’ (Acts 3:14; 7:12). This is interesting not least because it appears that the Spirit has a similar epithet, namely the Holy One (2:20) who anoints the believer with knowledge. Furthermore here in 1 Jn 2:1 Jesus is explicitly called  <i class="calibre4">parakletos</i>, a term used explicitly for the Spirit in the Gospel, but also implicitly for Christ since the Spirit is called ‘another Advocate’ (Jn 14:16). The  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> language in 1 John refers exclusively to the Father who is said to be Light (1:5) and Love (4:8), and is said to be the object of the believer's love (2:5 perhaps), but the epitome of love is said to be God's sending of his Son into the world and the Son's laying down his life in atonement for sins (3:16; 4:9–10). It also becomes clear that acknowledging Jesus as both Son and the Christ who came and is coming in the flesh is a statement of Christology as well as anthropology. But the author is not just interested in the first coming of Christ, he wants his audience to be prepared for the second coming as well which is said to be an appearing which will involve the transformation of believers into his likeness (3:2). Christ came in the first place to destroy the Devil's work (3:8) but will come a second time to complete his own work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God sent not only his Son into the world but gave ‘of’ his Spirit to believers as well (1 Jn 4:13). It is only really in 1 John that we find much discussion of the Spirit, and here would be a good juncture to consider 1 Jn 5:6–10. Since it reveals the most about the author's Trinitarian thinking we will treat it in more detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1 Jn 5:6–10 provides us with one of the real cruxes in all of Johannine literature. Some preliminary remarks help us narrow the focus on what is actually being discussed here: <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> we are talking about a person here ‘the one who … ’; Page 6 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> <b class="calibre3">(2)</b> the verb tense is in the aorist, referring to a past coming; <b class="calibre3">(3)</b> the first mention speaks of coming ‘through water and blood’ (using ‘ <i class="calibre4">dia</i>’), while in the second use of the phrase the preposition chosen is ‘ <i class="calibre4">en</i>’. Some would say the difference is not clear or intelligible, and it is not clear if anything hangs on this difference; <b class="calibre3">(4)</b> if the difference in prepositions is just a matter of stylistic variation then what the phrase means in verse 6a is likely also what it means in 6b and 7a; <b class="calibre3">(p. 75) (5)</b> we are told that the One who came is Jesus Christ. Thus the subject here is not ‘grace’ or the Holy Spirit, or in fact as we shall see the sacraments (Witherington 1989). It is rather Jesus himself. The use of the aorist participle  <i class="calibre4">elthon</i> (‘came’) here points to punctiliar events in the past, not a continual coming through the sacraments in the present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is rather decisively against the sacramental interpretation is that the verb here is in the past tense, not a present tense indicating an ongoing coming. Furthermore, the term </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘blood’ by itself is nowhere used in the NT as an allusion to the Lord's Supper. In fact, the sacramental interpretation is not attested before the fourth century AD and earlier Church Fathers, like Tertullian ( <i class="calibre4">On Baptism</i> 16), make clear that the sacramental interpretation should not be read into this text. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A second view is that we have an allusion to the blood and water that flowed from Christ's side according to Jn 19:34–5, referring, it is thought, to the cleansing and life-giving properties that derive from Christ's death (Calvin's view). Against this however is 1 Jn 5:6b which clearly distinguishes between the coming by water and the coming by blood. It says ‘not only by water, but also by blood’. Furthermore, the order of reference in Jn 19 is blood and water, not the reverse. I would argue in addition that there is no sacramental significance in Jn 19 either. The point of that passage is to confirm that Jesus, a real human being, really died. Furthermore, the reference in 1 Jn 5:8 to there being three witnesses, not just two (as would be required if ‘water and blood’ refers to just the death of Jesus), seems decisive against such a correlation of our text with Jn 19:34–5. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More plausible is the suggestion that water and blood here refers to Jesus’ baptism and death. But is there any other allusion to Jesus’ baptism in this letter, much less a direct reference to it? Perhaps there is, but it is not Jesus who ‘comes’ through water, but rather the Spirit who comes upon Jesus as he is leaving the water according to the Synoptic accounts (see Mk 1:9–11 and parr.). I suppose one could argue Jesus came into his ministry, or was empowered for his ministry at the baptismal event, though it was not either through or in water, strictly speaking, that this happened. Furthermore, in the Fourth Gospel Jesus’ baptism is not mentioned directly at all! Then too, notice that the Spirit is mentioned as a third witness here, after mentioning blood, and is not mentioned together with water as a joint witness which we would expect if water plus Spirit at baptism was what was in our author's mind. The focus here is on soteriological matters, not sacramental or broadly historical ones. The proper question to ask is: What events of soteriological significance for the believer could be referred to that are Christological in character? It seems more probable then that the reference is to Jesus’ birth and Jesus’ death, two sub</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> jects which definitely have been central in this sermon with water as the cipher for birth and blood the cipher for death. In support of this is also the fact that at 5:18 we have another reference to the birth of Jesus—he is called the One born of God just as he is called the one begotten of God earlier at 1 Jn 4:9. It has also been argued rather well that the similarities between 1 Jn 4:2 and 5:6 suggest that both texts refer to the Incarnation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 76) </b>The word ‘water’, in both Jn 3:5 and in our text, refers to physical birth. Both the phrases ‘came through or in water’, and the phrase ‘born out of water’ (Jn 3:5), are perfectly natural ways to speak of this. In fact, as I have shown elsewhere water was used as a euphemism in Jewish literature to refer to: (1) semen; (2) the fluid in which the foetus was floating; (3) the ‘breaking of the waters’ as the birth process started. Physical birth took place in homes and in the regular view of family members. Talking about someone coming through or in or out of water would have sounded in that environment like a discussion of physical birth. Thus, water is not only a symbol of life in general in the Fourth Gospel (whether natural or everlasting life—see Jn 4) and 1 John, it is a symbol of new life, the beginning of life as well. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but only the Holy Spirit gives the new birth. If we ask what it means to say Jesus ‘came’ by water and blood to believers the answer is that we are talking about the soteriological significance of these events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The schismatics were not likely denying that Jesus of Nazareth lived and died, rather they denied the soteriological significance of these events in his life. This denial is tantamount to denying Jesus is messiah, Son of God, and Saviour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three great witnesses here then are the birth and death of Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are the things that most confirm God's love and activity in the world, and for believers. Jesus came to the world through his birth and through his death, and he comes now through the Spirit. These are the means through which the believer has life, light, faith, power, hope, love—all the qualities this epideictic discourse is trying to inculcate and all the verities it is trying to remind the audience of in regard to Christ, with orthodox belief in him being the conduit of all these things. Put another way, the three nodal moments of most soteriological weight and importance for the salvation of human beings are the coming of Jesus, the death of Jesus, and the coming of the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We also learn here that the Spirit can be believed because the Spirit is Truth come in person (see Jn 14:26; 15:26; 16:13), just as God is said to be love, and Christ is said to be salvation in this discourse. Notice that we are told that the Spirit's witness is now—‘ <i class="calibre4">marturoun</i>’ is in the present tense here. Note as well that the terminology for witness occurs some ten times in five verses. Obviously it is the dominant idea here. All of this passage, and what follows it, is tremendously reminiscent of Jn 14–17. Since the Spirit is the Truth, the Spirit is best suited to lead the believer into all truth about Jesus. We need to keep in mind that in Jewish ways of thinking, the truth of anything needed to be validated by at least two viable witnesses (Deut. 19:15,  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 17:6). Here however we have three impeccable ones, which the author is stressing is more than enough good reasons to believe Jesus is God's Son and as such the believer's saviour. Moreover these three witnesses are at one, says the text—they agree and are unified on these facts, unified in the way they testify about Jesus. They all attest to the same truth though in different ways. In the case of Page 8 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> the Spirit one is dealing with divine testimony, so the point is that even if you don’t listen to human testimony, the Spirit still should convince you about Jesus. God testifies to his Son through his Spirit. Trinitarianism is implicit throughout this passage, a fact which was to be amplified in the  <i class="calibre4">Textus Receptus</i>, through the additions to verse 7 and verse 8. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 77) </b>In 1 Jn 5:8 we hear that ‘the three are for the one’ to put it literally. This is an all for one kind of statement. There is one particular Christological truth that these three witnesses are testifying to. The three witnesses converge, they are not merely univocal. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jn 5:9 uses a ‘from the lesser to the greater’ form of argument to say that if one has believed human testimony about Jesus (e.g. by the Baptist: Jn 1; 5:33–6; or by the author himself), how much greater is the testimony of God to his Son (presumably by means of the Spirit internally:  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 5:36). The threefold witness is a threefold divine testimony to Jesus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At verse 10 (1 Jn 5:10) we have two ideas—the testimony of God to the Son, and the divine and internal testimony that comes through the Spirit, when one accepts on faith the external testimony. The one who believes in the Son of God has assurance that his faith is not in vain from the internal testimony of the Spirit. Here the emphasis is on the individual—‘the one who believes … ’. Thus quite logically the work of confirmation by the Spirit follows belief in the external testimony, and the making of the good confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While most Trinitarian discussion in the NT is implicit at best, here it begins to become more explicit because we begin to get rather clear-cut divisions of labour in regard to what Father, Son, and Spirit do, even though they all testify to the same truth. The Jewish character of the material remains clear in that ‘God’ is properly speaking of the Father, when it comes to what  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> denotes in 1–3 John, but equally clearly the Son and the Spirit are said to be part of the Godhead and come from God. It is understandable why much of the theological discussion about the Trinity at Nicaea and later at Chalcedon focused on matters that arose from the Fourth Gospel and 1 John, with some important glances at the Pauline material. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Revelation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While it is rightly clear to most commentators that the last book in the NT canon was written by someone other than the author of 1–3 John and/or the Fourth Gospel, it seems likely that John of Patmos was influenced in various ways by the earlier Johannine materials, though he chooses to express the common truths using his own vocabulary (e.g. noting the different Greek word he uses for lamb to that found in the Fourth Gospel). The theology of Christ as the Word does not get prominent play in Revelation as it does in John 1, and instead the central Christological image becomes that of Christ as the Lamb of God (see e.g. Rev. 5:22). This is not however because the author had a so-called lower Christology, but rather because he wished to assert an equally high Christology in his own terms, not least of which was accomplished through applying the terms Alpha and Omega to both the Father and the Son ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Rev. 1 and 22). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Johannine Literature</b> As is to be expected, Revelation speaks of the Spirit of God largely as the apocalyptic OT </p>
<p class="calibre1">prophets Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah would, namely as the inspirer of words and visions. Importantly in Revelation there is a strong emphasis as well on the Spirit not only being in the prophet or the prophet in the Spirit (see Rev. 4:1–2), but also of the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 78)</b> Spirit being immanent in the community (‘the Spirit and the bride say’: Rev. 22:17). This explains as well the reference to the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5) by which John means the fullness of the Spirit dwelling in each of the seven churches he is addressing. The Spirit as in the rest of the Johannine corpus is seen as personal (e.g. ‘the Spirit says … ’, again noting Rev. 22:17), and is not treated merely as a force or power. In terms of theological space then, the Father and the Son are envisioned as above whilst the Spirit dwells below with the bride (i.e. the Church). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The theophany followed by Christophany in Rev. 4 and 5 shows just how far John is prepared to go in asserting the deity of Christ. Both Father and Son are objects of worship, and both sit on the throne only intended for God. Whereas God is rather monolithically presented as Father (not only of believers but he is even said in Rev. 1:6 to be Jesus’ God and Father), by contrast there is a cornucopia of images applied to the Son in Revelation to make clear his exalted status and roles—the First and Last, the Alpha and Omega, the Living One, the Lamb and the Lion, the Rider on the white horse, as well as more familiar images like the Son of Man, the Son of God, Lord, and Christ. Indeed, John is prepared to transfer not only titles but images and features of the Ancient of Days to Christ (see Rev. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1–4). This is because John actually sees the Son and the Father as one not merely in will and purpose but in some sense one in nature as well. Here the helpful work of Richard Bauckham on the Oneness of God referring to God's unity of being, not his singleness of personhood, is helpful (Bauckham 2008). Distinction of some roles (only the Lamb is or could be slain) in no way compromises the singular divinity shared by Father, Son, and Spirit in this book. It is God in Christ who will dwell with God's people in the end, just as it is God in Christ to whom the martyrs appeal from under the altar, for he is the Judge of all the world who alone can unseal the seals (Rev. 5–6). Thus it is that Christ is the agent of both redemption and judgement, and indeed of redemption of God's people by judgement of others in various places in this book (see e.g. Rev. 19). The focus of course in Revelation is on the exalted Christ and what he is doing since his exaltation. So much is this the case that in Rev. 12 the earthly tenure of Christ is mentioned only in passing and God is said to snatch him from the earth after he has been born of ‘the woman’. Notice that Rev. 12:5 refers to his post-exaltation judging of the world immediately after referring to the birth of the male child. But lest we think he is not much interested in the earthly role of the Christ, Rev. 4 makes clear that Christ is the exalted Lamb of God precisely because he was the slain Lamb of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have seen much material in the Johannine corpus of import for the construction of a doctrine of the Trinity, and not only so we have seen in all these documents how the assembling of that document had already begun in the NT era. The doctrine of the Trinity cannot be said to be a later construct imposed on the NT so long as the Johannine literature remains a part of the NT canon. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article considers the exegesis of the Scripture and the early Christian doctrine of the Trinity. It suggests that though the materials for the doctrine of the Trinity are scriptural, the doctrine is nowhere stated in the Scriptures. It explores how the exegesis of Scripture, against the Gnostics' rejection of the Old Testament and in the face of other heterodox currents, led to the language in which Trinitarian doctrine was formulated during the first centuries of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: exegesis, Scripture, Christian doctrine, Trinity, Gnostics, Old Testament THE materials for the doctrine of the Trinity are scriptural, though the doctrine is nowhere stated in the Scriptures. It is necessary to keep both halves of this truism in mind, because for every critic who writes as though the doctrine belonged to the primitive deposit of Christianity, there is another who represents it as a stepchild which the Church acquired by cementing an imprudent marriage with Greek philosophy. It is possible that the human mind is inclined to think in threes when it does not think in twos or fours, and it is clear that Greek philosophers were fond of triads even before the advent of Christianity; it is equally clear, however, that the paradoxical notion of three persons, each identical with the one God but none identical with the other two, is one that no philosopher would have permitted to ensnare him if he were entirely free to choose his own premises. Christians, however, were required to hold, on the authority of Jesus and the prophets, that God is one (Deut. 6:4; Mk 12:29), while they were also required to acknowledge Jesus himself not only as Son of God but as Lord (Matt. 7:21–2 etc.), as creator of all (Jn 1:3–4; Heb. 1:2), and as the one on whom the name above all names had been conferred (Phil. 2:9). To us, declares Paul, there is one God and one Lord Jesus Christ (1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cor. 8:6); the Church is thus required to make one of two, but, since the same apostle prayed that his correspondents might receive the fellowship of the Holy Spirit along with the grace of Jesus Christ and love of the Father (2 Cor. 13:13), and since the last injunction of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew is to baptize the nations in the name of the Father, Page 1 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19), it would seem that where there are two there must be three. Once so much was conceded, one could discover an adumbration of the Trinity in the late coda to the Lord's Prayer, ‘thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory’ ( <i class="calibre4">Didache</i>). Where the kingdom belongs to the Father, the Son is his power and the Spirit glorifies both Father and Son in the present world; or one could argue that at Rom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">11:36, where all is said to come from God, through God, and in God, each preposition signifies  <b class="calibre3">(p. 81) </b>the activity of a different person. But such manoeuvres would have been superfluous if Christians had not felt bound to pay their devoirs to some name other than that of God the Father, or if they had not subscribed to the first commandment of the Decalogue, which forbade them to apportion different names to different gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Epistle to the Hebrews is perhaps the first—and certainly the one canonical—writing which sets out a rationale for the worship of Christ from the unfulfilled imperatives and prophecies of the old covenant. It does not begin from nothing, for the author expects his correspondents to grant that the Son, through whom the world was created, is an  <i class="calibre4">apaugasma</i> or effulgence of the Father's glory and the  <i class="calibre4">kharakter</i> or impression of his hypostasis (Heb. 1:3). The first metaphor suggests that the divine fecundity which was merely personified at Wisd. 7:26 has now been manifested as a real person; the second requires decipherment, and we shall see that it was from this phrase that the Greek Church learned to speak of three hypostases and the Latin of one substance. With the Sonship as his postulate, the author proceeds to demonstrate the necessity of Christ's ministry from liturgical texts, or rather from the want of another phenomenon to complete what these texts foreshadow. How, had he been an angel, would God have said to him, ‘This day have I begotten thee’ (Heb. 1:5, citing Ps. 2:7)? Where, except in his person, do we see man crowned with glory after a period of subjection to the angels (Heb. 2:9, citing Ps. 8:5)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where are the people whom Jesus (that is, Joshua) led to the promised land, if God said to the fathers of the Israelites, ‘You shall not enter into my rest’ (Heb. 3:18, citing Ps. 95:11; <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Heb. 4:8)? If further proof were required that it is in Christ, and not in Israel after the flesh, that the biblical promises are made good, we may ask what became of the priesthood of Melchisedek, which was evidently superior to that of the Levites, as they were descendants of Abraham, whereas he, the medium of God's benediction on Abraham, was a man without father or mother (Heb. 7:3–10). If the Levitical offerings were sufficient to expiate sin, the law would not have enjoined that they be iterated year by year (9:25). As the tabernacle was but an adumbration of its heavenly archetype, so the imperfect covenant in the blood of beast was sealed at last by the sacrifice of a ‘high priest after the order of Melchisedek’ (Heb. 6:20, 10:21), who, as celebrant and victim in one (9:11–12), may be likened to a testator who gives effect to his own provisions by his death (Heb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">9:16–17). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here we see in its rudiments the casuistry that produced a Trinitarian creed from the Scriptures of a unitarian people. It would not be true to say that the sacred writ is merely a substrate for a prefabricated doctrine, for the author appeals not only to the records of Christ's death and exaltation, but to palpable inconcinnities and riddles in the text, which cannot be resolved (or so he argues) without an acknowledgement of his Messianic dignity. We do not know antecedently, however, what this dignity entails, and a fuller under</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> standing of it can be gained only by close attention to the text. We must already possess a first language before we can master the grammar of that language, but the grammar, once mastered, enables us to use the language with more accuracy. In the same way, one must already be a Christian before one can discover the face of Christ in the Scriptures of Israel; yet one who applies the Christian hermeneutic to these Scriptures is not doomed to learn only what he already knows, any more than being a native speaker  <b class="calibre3">(p. 82) </b>of English will preclude me from discovering constructions new to me in an English grammar. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Early Gleanings</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Revelations to Israel which had come to be deemed prophetic, disclosures of Christ's sonship and divinity in the gospels, and deductions from both prophecy and gospel in the writings of the apostolic age were parsed and amplified according to principles canonized in the same apostolic texts. It cannot be said, however, that these principles necessitated a doctrine of three persons in one substance. By the middle of the second century, some were prepared to assign a ‘second place’ to the Son in worship, while acknowledging the Spirit as ‘third in order’ (Justin Martyr,  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 13); nevertheless, the affirmation that each of the three is God was not an immediate corollary of the liturgical invocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it can be maintained that the Greek word  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> designates Christ at Rom. 9:5, Titus 2:13, and 1 Jn 5:20, the syntax is ambiguous in each case; at Jn 20:28, the exclamation of Thomas ‘My Lord and my God’ has been construed as an ejaculatory prayer of thanks to God the Father; and Jn 1:1, which undoubtedly uses ‘God’ ( <i class="calibre4">ho theos</i>, with the definite article) as the proper name of the Father, omits the article when it goes on to declare that his Word is  <i class="calibre4">theos</i>, and may therefore be understood to mean, not that the Word is God in essence, but that to those whom he creates he is all that God is, just as Moses was made  <i class="calibre4">theos</i>—that is to say, the plenipotentiary of God—to Pharaoh at Exodus 7:1. A generation earlier than Justin, Ignatius of Antioch, whose letters celebrate the exaltation of the Christ who was also the Son and Word of God, seldom grants him the cognomen <i class="calibre4">theos</i> without the qualification that he is ‘ <i class="calibre4">our</i> God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i>, proem.;  <i class="calibre4">Trallians</i> 7;  <i class="calibre4">Romans</i> 1; but at  <i class="calibre4">Smyrnaeans</i> 1, simply ‘God’). It cannot be proved that Ignatius was acquainted with the Fourth Gospel, but this usage would sit well with a rigorous parsing of the word  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> (in contradistinction to  <i class="calibre4">ho theos</i>) at Jn 1:1. He avers that this second object of his worship coexisted before the ages with the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i> 6), but does not add that he was God; he may, however, be ready to draw the inference from Jn 1:14 that, if  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> and  <i class="calibre4">logos</i> are predicated of a single subject, it was as  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> that this subject ‘became’ or ‘came to be’ in flesh. He certainly declares in  <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i> 7 that the Saviour was both human and divine, but adopts an ambiguous construction ( <i class="calibre4">en sarki genomenos</i> <i class="calibre4">theos</i>), so that he may be proclaiming either that God came to be in the flesh or that it was in the flesh that Christ came to be God. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> trine of the triune God, the Gnostics may have excited speculation in other quarters on relation between the hidden God and his manifold revelation. In the mid second century, a work that might be characterized as a transformational grammar of the Old  <b class="calibre3">(p. 83) </b>Testament was compiled by Justin Martyr in the form of a dialogue with Trypho the Jew. To Trypho it seems incredible that a man should be god, that one who had died in ignominy should be the hope of Israel, or that the beneficiaries of this hope should not be those to whom the Word of God was first confided. To Justin, on the other hand, it is in his written word, where this has not been mutilated by the Jews who profess to hold it in awe, that God is revealed as another than the Father. Jewish thought had already bestowed a hypostatic character on such attributes as the name, the word, and the wisdom of god, which are frequently represented as his vicegerents in scriptural prophecy and narrative (Deut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">12:21; Ps. 33:6; Prov. 8:22). Passages in which he acts through angels were thought to prove that the Almighty can approach his own handiwork only through created intermediaries; yet it is commonly implied that when God speaks through proxies he also speaks in person, and even when his countenance is confessedly hidden he may be said to communicate face to face (Exodus 33:11; 33:23; 34:33–5). The solution advanced by Justin is that the one whom Christians call the Word is the vehicle of the Father's revelation to his creatures. It was (he explains) impossible that the Father, who has no form and no true name among his creatures, should assume the flesh and thus subject himself to the constraints of a finite world (Justin,  <i class="calibre4">Second Apology</i> 6). The Son, and not the Father, is the one who manifested himself in angelic guise to the ancestors of Israel (Justin,  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 63;  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 56–61); hence it is that Moses can be said to have been addressed both by the Lord and by the angel of the Lord from the burning bush, and it is because there is more than one in the Godhead that Abraham played host to three at Mamre ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 56). The Wisdom who proclaims herself the lieutenant of creation at Prov. 8:22 is evidently speaking in her own voice, not the Father's, and this is the voice of God the Word ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 129.3–4); in other texts, the person or  <i class="calibre4">prosôpon</i> of the speaker must be identified by the skilled and faithful exegete who is looking for adumbrations of the Gospel. The Jew may find his reasoning arbitrary, but he cannot hope to account for verses in which the Lord extols or enthrones the Lord, or in which the Lord rains fire from the Lord, unless he is willing to confess that God did not always manifest himself as one. At the same time, Justin remains a monotheist: distinct as the Son and Father may be, they are so much at one that, even in the Old Testament, it is by the name Jesus that the ineffable God has made himself known to humankind ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with</i> <i class="calibre4">Trypho</i> 75). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether or not he derived it from the prologue to the Fourth Gospel, Justin took up the title Logos or Word, and like the evangelist, applied it to Christ as the maker of all (Justin, <i class="calibre4">Second Apology</i> 6;  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 61) and the perfect emissary of the Father's will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theophilus of Antioch, a contemporary of Justin, was the first to subsume the three objects of ecclesiastical worship under a single term that is not found in the Scriptures: his <i class="calibre4">trias</i>—the common Greek for a triad—consists, however, not of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but of God, Logos, and Sophia (Theophilus,  <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 15). From Justin we learn nothing about the distinctive powers and attributes of the Third Person, except that he is Page 4 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> the source of prophecy (Justin,  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 13, 37–44 etc.). He and Theophilus concur, not so much in their anatomy of the Godhead, as in their willingness to seek elucidation of the term Logos among the Greeks. Theophilus described the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 84) </b>second person in his latent phase as the  <i class="calibre4">logos endiathetos</i>, or inward meditation, of the Father (Theophilus, <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 2,10); this usage may have encouraged the adoption of the Stoic antonym, <i class="calibre4">logos prophorikos</i>, to define his supervenient identity as the ‘audible speech’ of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These speculations not only gave an extensive sphere of action to the Word before his nativity; they also put philosophy at the service of exegesis without surrendering the inspiration of Scripture or the primacy of Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Logic and Plurality</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We have seen that Justin adds the term  <i class="calibre4">prosôpon</i> to the vocabulary of Christian hermeneutics: it was not a yet a term of Christian metaphysics, denoting one of three hypostases, and proponents of the Trinity had yet to devise a logic which would reconcile the existence of three persons with the simplicity of the one God. ‘Monarchian’ is the appellative in a number of ancient texts for those who argue either that Father, Son, and Spirit are the same entity in different modes, or else that Son and Spirit are epiphenomena of the true substrate, who alone deserves the name God. Such teaching is now heresy; in Rome at the beginning of the third century, on the other hand, to honour the Son as a being distinct from the Father was to expose oneself to the charge of ditheism, and hence of breaking the First Commandment. Two successive bishops of Rome, Zephyrinus and Callistus, are said to have countenanced, though Callistus (as his gadfly Hippolytus tells us) tried to break his fall into heresy by according the title ‘Son’ to the manhood of Christ, which he supposed to have been inhabited by the Father's spirit, not by a second person of the Godhead. According to the same informant, the war cry of the monarchians in Rome was  <i class="calibre4">hen prosôpon</i>, a single person (Hippolytus,  <i class="calibre4">Refutation of all Heresies</i> 9.12.18). This is an unexceptionable formula if it means only that the Father is revealed in the works and teachings of the embodied Son, for then it merely encapsulates the saying </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He who has seen me has seen the Father’ (Jn 14:9). Hippolytus, however, took it to signify that, even in the Godhead itself, there is no more than a modal or specious difference between the persons. His own watchword, ‘two  <i class="calibre4">prosôpa</i>’ seems to have been an innovation ( <i class="calibre4">Refutation of all Heresies</i> 9.12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hippolytus was a Greek in Rome, and it seems to have been in the Latin world that the noun which signifies ‘person’ was detached from its hermeneutic use and became the standard term to designate one of the three in God. It is common, in expositions of Tertullian, to oppose his three  <i class="calibre4">personae</i> to his one  <i class="calibre4">substantia</i>, seeking no antecedent to either in the biblical text. No doubt scholars are right to ignore his passing citation of Lamentations 4:20, which in the Latin version of his day speaks obscurely of a  <i class="calibre4">persona</i> of the Father and his Spirit (Tertullian,  <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 14); to neglect the biblical provenance of <i class="calibre4">substantia</i>, on the other hand, is to grasp only half of its meaning. One passage from his writings, with a supporting text from a younger contemporary in the Greek world, will direct us to its cradle. Tertullian advances it as an axiom at  <i class="calibre4">Praxeas</i> 7.9 that the Son is  <i class="calibre4">ex</i> Page 5 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> <i class="calibre4">substantia patris</i>, from the Father's substance; in Origen this is a gloss on  <b class="calibre3">(p. 85) </b>Heb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1:3, where the Son is styled the  <i class="calibre4">kharaktêr</i> or impression of the  <i class="calibre4">hupostasis</i> of the Father (Pamphilus,  <i class="calibre4">Apology for Origen</i>, 94ff.). This appears to mean that he is the manifest sign, and the Father the hidden reality that he signifies. Tertullian discovers in this one passage an intimation of both unity and duality in the Godhead. That which is engendered by the Father cannot fail to inherit his substance, but neither, at the same time, can it fail to possess the substantiality, the capacity to exist without reliance on other natures, which is the property of all substance, and of divine substance in an eminent degree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Johannine title  <i class="calibre4">logos</i>, which not only denotes the person of Christ but defines it in contradistinction to the other two, received more attention in Christian Alexandria than the generic terms hypostasis and  <i class="calibre4">prosôpon</i>. Clement of Alexandria does not forget the sense of the Greek term logos, which implies for him that Christ is the light of all rational creation, and that scriptural texts may be fruitfully juxtaposed with the aphorisms of philosophy. For all that, Clement's Logos is no abstraction. Greek passages, still extant, declare that the Son is no  <i class="calibre4">prophorikos logos</i>, meaning that he is not a mere operation of the Father, as human speech is an operation of the speaker (Clement,  <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 5.1.6;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Photius,  <i class="calibre4">Bibliotheca</i> 109). The embodied Word alone is the  <i class="calibre4">prosôpon</i> or representative of the Father (Clement,  <i class="calibre4">Paedagogus</i> 1.57); the Word above abides in sameness ( <i class="calibre4">tautotês</i>) as the companion of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Excerpts from Theodotus</i> 8.1), and the Latin translator of a lost work implies that the two are eternally distinct ( <i class="calibre4">Fragment on Epistle of John</i> 3.1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen, an Alexandrian of the next generation, strongly maintains the coeternity of the three hypostases, which are never three  <i class="calibre4">prosôpa</i> in his writings (Origen,  <i class="calibre4">Commentary on</i> <i class="calibre4">John</i> 2.10.25). Like Clement, he draws the lineaments of the Word from his own revelation, his interpretation of which is almost injudiciously literal, if ‘literal’ means ‘paying strict attention to the letter’. ‘Allegory’ is only one of his names—or rather, as he would say, the Apostle's name—for the higher sense which emerges when we assume that every letter in Holy Writ was penned for our sakes and under uniform inspiration ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Philokalia</i> 5). To identify Christ with a character in the Old Testament, let alone with a mere personification, is to flout the modern protocols of historical criticism; but to Origen it seemed that only those who preached two gods would deny that the Father's helpmeet in creation was the agent known to John as the Word and to Paul as the Wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:21–</p>
<p class="calibre1">4). Against those who had reified Wisdom and Word as different subjects, he explains that these are accommodatory titles ( <i class="calibre4">epinoiai</i>); at the same time, they are titles of a real subject, with the attributes of God. We should not suppose, he urges, that the Wisdom of God, who is Christ, could ever have failed to exist or existed otherwise than hypostatically (Origen,  <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,2,2). It is true that the Son is Wisdom in relation to the Father, and Word or Logos in relation to a world of rational but transient beings, the  <i class="calibre4">logikoi</i> (Origen,  <i class="calibre4">Commentary on John</i> 1.31.223–6); it does not, however, follow that the Logos is posterior to Wisdom in time, for at all times the mind of God has housed a realm of noetic entities, the  <i class="calibre4">logika</i>, which are subject to his government ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,4,5). The bond between Father and Son does not preclude our calling the latter a  <i class="calibre4">ktisma</i> or creature ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 4,4,1, with Justinian,  <i class="calibre4">Letter to Mennas</i>), for this is the appellative of Wisdom herself at Prov. 8:22 and signifies only that  <b class="calibre3">(p. 86) </b>she exhibits the will of Page 6 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> the Father without defect. The Son, who is styled the image of the invisible God at Col. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1:15, may be likened to a statue which reveals the character of an infinite prototype ( <i class="calibre4">On</i> <i class="calibre4">First Principles</i> 1,2,8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because no clear distinction is observed here between the incarnate Christ and the Second Hypostasis before descent, we cannot be sure that an eternal subordination of Son to Father is implied. A certain ontological priority is certainly accorded to the Father, in Origen's view, by the opening verse of the Gospel of John, in which the word  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> is afforced by the definite article when it refers to the father but not when applied to the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen concludes that, while Son is truly  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> or god, the Father is  <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i> or God in himself ( <i class="calibre4">Commentary on John</i> 2.2.17). Because the Son is the image of the Father, the bond between them is a natural one, analogous to that between Adam and Seth, who at Gen. 5:3 is not only the first man's offspring but his image ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,2,6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Scriptures call him the effulgence or emanation of the Father (Heb. 1:3, Wisd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7:25), the Son resembles a vapour which is  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> or consubstantial with the ointment that exudes it (Pamphilus,  <i class="calibre4">Apology</i>, 100). Because, however, the adjective  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> was most commonly used in his day of synthetic or material bodies, Origen cannot apply it without a caveat to the persons of the Godhead. Here, as elsewhere, the Scripture is sovereign; here as elsewhere, the parallels are collated and the metaphors that do not admit of elucidation from other scriptural texts are glossed by a partial and circumspect analogy from the corporeal realm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Nicaea to Constantinople</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early fourth century, Bishop Alexander of Alexandria revived the conceit that the Logos is so called because he is the utterance of the Father (Socrates,  <i class="calibre4">Church History</i> 1.6.16). He nevertheless did not say that the Son is  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> with the Father; on the contrary he might be thought to have granted the Son his own substance when he styled him his peerless image of the Father (Theodoret,  <i class="calibre4">Church Histor</i> y 1.4.47). This allusion to Col. 1:15, reminiscent of Origen, is put to similar use by the latter's admirer and biographer, Eusebius of Caesarea, who in other respects was no friend to Alexander (Eusebius, <i class="calibre4">Demonstration of the Gospel</i> 5.4.10). Believing that one cannot prove more than the Scriptures teach, Eusebius declines to affirm the eternity of the Son, though he identifies him with the Wisdom of Prov. 8:22, created by the Father before all ages. He does not profess to determine in what sense the Son is created and in what sense he is begotten; to know so much would be to know more than Isaiah, who asked ‘his generation who can declare?’ ( <i class="calibre4">Demonstration</i> 5.1.14, citing Isa. 53:8). Origen's compound  <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i> is revived at  <i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical Theology</i> 3.17.14 to represent the whole God as mediated by the Son ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Against Marcellus</i> 2.16–17). In his  <i class="calibre4">Demonstration of the Gospel</i>, which purports to establish only and  <i class="calibre4">in toto</i> what the Church is bound to proclaim with divine authority, Eusebius discovers that the Son is revealed in the Scriptures of Israel as a ‘second God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Demonstration</i> 5.30.3). While he hints elsewhere that there is some likeness between the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 87) </b>Son and the ‘second’ principle whom Plato subordinates to the ‘king of all’ (Eusebius,  <i class="calibre4">Preparation for the Gospel</i> 11.22), the analogy is avowedly imperfect and Page 7 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> could not have been maintained without biblical warrant. Furthermore, the audacity of the locution ‘second god’ lies in its affirmation of the Son's divinity, for it was this, and not the subjection of the Son to the Father, that was widely contested at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conflict between the churches was precipitated by a controversy in Alexandria. Against Alexander the presbyter Arius argued that to call the Son  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> with the Father, or to speak of emanation and projection, was to introduce division and passibility to the Godhead. To many it appeared that he added blasphemy to defiance by declaring that the Son was ‘out of nothing’ (Theodoret,  <i class="calibre4">Church History</i> 1.5.3), and that before he was begotten he was not. Arius culled a succession of phrases from the New Testament, though without direct citation, to prove that goodness, wisdom, truth, and immortality are peculiar attributes of God the Father (Athanasius,  <i class="calibre4">On Synods</i> 16). His reading of the texts to which he alludes may be described as parsimonious, since he takes them to refer to the Father in contradistinction to every other subject, and not merely in contradistinction to the gods of other nations. According to his posthumous tormentor Athanasius he deduced from Prov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8:22 that the wisdom which accompanied God in the fashioning of the world was itself created; certainly this notorious text would have justified his belief that the terms ‘created’ and ‘begotten’ may be used with equal propriety of the Son, or second hypostasis after the Father. Like many of his contemporaries, he assumes that the title ‘Son’ denotes a status which belonged to the second hypostasis before his incarnation; he does not, however, conclude that the relation between the Son and the Father is one of natural filiation, perhaps because he is conscious that in the Scriptures a son may be the disciple of a human teacher or a created representative of God. The equation of Christ with Wisdom, on the other hand, was a commonplace. It was after the Nicene Council that Marcellus of Ancyra declared the Proverbs of Solomon too enigmatic to serve as proof-texts (Eusebius, <i class="calibre4">Against Marcellus</i> 1.3.13–14), and a generation later still that Gregory of Nyssa ( <i class="calibre4">Against</i> <i class="calibre4">Eunomius</i> 1.299) and Epiphanius ( <i class="calibre4">Panarion</i> 69.25) drew its poison by appealing to the translation of Aquila, in which the verb is not ‘created’ but ‘possessed’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In reply to the ‘Arians’, Athanasius pleads that the exegete cannot be guided by a few words plucked from the text, but by the  <i class="calibre4">skopos</i> or tenor of the surrounding passage. Thus to read on from Prov. 8:22 to Prov. 8:25 (‘before all the hills he begets me’ in the Septuagint) will suffice to disarm an adversary who, unlike Arius, maintained that the Second Person is created and not begotten (Athanasius,  <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.56). Against Arius himself, who embraced ‘begotten’ and ‘created’ as equally halting approximations to an inexpressible mode of origin, Athanasius observes that the divine word never uses the term ‘begotten’ of things that are properly created ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.48). Yet he himself is conscious that other passages, such as those which speak of Christ's susceptibility to passions or of his having received divinity as the reward of his obedience, will not support the claim that the Son is God by nature unless they are read through a Trinitarian prism. The required hermeneutic, he argues, is provided by the Church, outside whose discipline the most learned man is a heretic, as guilty of wresting Scripture to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 88) </b>his own purpose as the devil ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 1.1). Since the Church teaches us to worship Christ ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.23), we cannot entertain any reading of the sacred text which reduces him to the status of a creature. As an instrument is inferior in dignity to the end Page 8 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> for which we employ it, so a Son who was created or brought forth for no other object than the making of the cosmos would be inferior to those things in heaven and earth which we are expressly forbidden to worship in the Decalogue ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.19, 2.30). To make him a product of the Father's will is to seek the cause of his existence in caprice and not in the necessary attributes of deity. He is not, in short, a product of the Father's will, but the will itself ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">These premises—that one cannot be at once creator and creature, that a creature cannot be the object of a cult, and that whatever proceeds from the Father's will does not proceed from his nature—are to him not so much presuppositions as luminous implications of the Christian faith, which must be brought as postulates to the interpretation of any given verse. Once it is thus established that the Arian construction of the text cannot be sound, the theologian may avail himself of a new prophylactic tool against false reading—the distinction between those titles, deeds, and sufferings which pertain to Christ as God and those which accrue to him as man ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 3.29 etc.). It is in his flesh that the Logos trembles, not in that nature which he shares with the Father; he puts forth his hand as man and heals as God ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 3.32). When he asks where to find the body of Lazarus he betrays a human ignorance; in raising him he demonstrates that God's power is also his ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 3.37–8). Prov. 8:22, with other texts implying growth or the acquisition of glory through toil and sacrifice (Lk. 2:52, Phil. 2:10), should be referred to his creation on our account, or rather to the new creation that he effects in us ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.50, 2.80). Even to be the true image of the Father (Col. 1:15), he must be the Son ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.2), and we show to an Emperor's statue the reverence due to the original ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 3.5). His subordination as man must not be allowed to obscure his majesty, for where a man is called both Son and servant in the Scriptures, it is the term ‘son’ that denotes the essence ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> 2.3). It follows for Athanasius, as he later contends in his letters to Serapion, that the Spirit is not a creature, since he accompanies Father and Son in all their works and is named beside them in the liturgy. We cannot, while upholding the divinity of the second person, deny that of the third. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Athanasius, as we have seen, distinguishes between proper and improper usage in the Scriptures, concluding that if the same entity is said to be both begotten and created, only the former term is employed in the proper sense. The party led by Basil of Ancyra and George of Laodicea—commonly styled, in their own day as in ours, the homoiousians—followed Arius and Eusebius in holding both terms to be equally instructive, and equally subject to qualification. Identity of nature is upheld, they urge, when we speak of the second person as begotten; on the other hand, we assert that he is created to make it clear that this communication of nature entails no lessening, alienation, or expansion of divine substance (Epiphanius,  <i class="calibre4">Panarion</i> 73.6.8). It was the homoiousians, not the homoousians, who were accused of making Father and Son equipollent, so that the latter no longer owed his generation to the former (Eunomius,  <i class="calibre4">Apology</i> 26). Their accuser, Eunomius of <b class="calibre3">(p. 89) </b>Cyzicus, appears to have based his reasoning not so much on exegesis as on the dogmatic postulate of divine simplicity, which he shared with his orthodox contemporaries. For him this entailed that the Godhead possesses no accidental properties which Page 9 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> could be divorced from the essence like the accidents of any created subject. Hence, he goes on in his  <i class="calibre4">Apology</i>, if one person in the Trinity is ingenerate and another generated, their essences, like their properties, must be antithetical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most durable refutations of Eunomius came from the Cappadocian Basil of Caesarea and his younger sibling Gregory of Nyssa. Both hold that Eunomius has been led astray by the specious clarity of human logic, forgetting that no human intellect can fathom God, and therefore failing to see that all our knowledge of him is deduced from his operations or from the names and attributes disclosed in Scripture. Even the appellative  <i class="calibre4">theos</i> (derived, as Gregory thinks, from a verb which means ‘to see’) implies that God is known to us through his providential government, but does not circumscribe his essence. The titles Father and Son should be preferred to the abstractions of Eunomius, not only because they are biblical, but because they indicate complementarity rather than opposition: it is as true that Sonship determines Fatherhood as that Fatherhood determines Sonship. Borrowing a caveat from Origen, Basil writes that even biblical terms are not true representations ( <i class="calibre4">ennoiai</i>) of the divine, but  <i class="calibre4">epinoiai</i>, or accommodations to our understanding. The Byzantine distinction between the unknowable essence of God and his known, though uncreated energies, is also anticipated in his writings. Gregory of Nyssa maintains that human reason is equally at fault when it infers that the Son is second in rank because his name comes second in the liturgy (Gregory of Nyssa,  <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i> 1.197–204), or that because there is dependence of one person on another in the Trinity, the effect must be inferior to the cause. Even the most self-evident deductions from the Scriptures may be challenged if they contravene the rule of faith: defending the analogy between three members of the class ‘man’ and the persons of the Trinity, Gregory is prepared to contend that, just as the three who are God make one God in the aggregate and not three, so three representatives of humanity constitute man and not three men. The use of the plural ‘men’ in the Scriptures is thus to be understood as a condescension to the vulgar idiom, not as a lesson in grammar to the theologian (Gregory of Nyssa,  <i class="calibre4">Letter</i> <i class="calibre4">to Ablabius</i>). The principle of winnowing the human from the divine in Christ was adopted by this new generation of Nicene theologians, while Heb. 1:3 comes into its own again in a letter attributed both to Gregory and to his brother Basil of Caesarea. Admitting that, if the Son is a  <i class="calibre4">kharaktêr</i> of the Father's  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>, it might appear that we have no grounds for assigning a distinct  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> to him, the author explains that it is precisely this unique dependence on the Father that constitutes the distinct  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> of the son. Like Tertullian, therefore, he employs one text to establish both the community of nature and the plurality of persons. The reasoning is consonant with Basil's exegesis of Mk 13:32, where the Son disowns knowledge of the final day. Where others construed these words as an ‘economic’ manifestation of the ignorance that is proper to a creature, Basil opines that the Son is speaking in his higher character, not so much denying that he knows as intimating that he knows only by virtue of the Father's knowledge (Letter 236). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a><b class="calibre3">Exegesis and the Early Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</b> <b class="calibre3">(p. 90) Latin Epilogue</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Latin exegesis before Nicaea, while it distinguished the humanity of Christ from his divinity, was not inclined to credit him with sayings that appertain to only one of these two natures. Novatian cites ‘the Father is greater than I’ (Jn 14:28) to prove that the Father and Son are distinct, and does not feel bound to say in what respect the Son is inferior (Novatian,  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> 26). After the Council Hilary of Poitiers thought it better to deny that Christ had suffered any temptation in Gethsemane than to argue that he was frail as man and resolute as God. When he begged that the cup might pass from his lips, says Hilary, Christ was asking not that he himself should be spared the Cross, but that a share in his tribulations might be imparted to the disciples. In Augustine's masterpiece  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i>, the integrity of Christ's person and his equality with the Father are the two presuppositions to be defended, and he is loath to surrender one to preserve the other. Rather than propose that the gift of the Spirit or the mission of the Son are true of them only in an economic sense, he denies that sending and giving entail inferiority of nature. Such inferiority might be inferred if the Son, as Justin and others supposed, were the only person of the Godhead who became visible to the patriarchs. Augustine therefore surmises that either God was represented by an angel, as the text often indicates (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> 3.11.22–7), or if one of the three is sent, this is not a proof of his inferiority but of his condescension ( <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> 4.18.24–20.30). Here, we may feel, is another case, where the canon is brought to the text and not derived from the text itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Augustine grounds his theology on the dictum ‘God is love’ (1 Jn 4:8), which he construes both as a biblical affidavit to the Trinitarian character of God and as a rule for exegesis. As a metaphysical axiom, it teaches us that the Spirit who acts as the copula between the loving Father and the beloved Son cannot be less than God, from which it follows that the Son who exhales the Spirit must be God also (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> 8.10.14). As a hermeneutic precept, it becomes fertile when combined with other beliefs that Augustine brings to the text—that, since the text itself is the Word of God, it must be informed by the living Word, and that, since the goal of all exegesis is to awaken charity (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">On Christian Doctrine</i> 1.36.40), the object which we seek in the text is invariably love. If Christ himself were not love there would be no surety that when we find one in the text we shall find the other; if we identify Christ with love, on the other hand, it follows inevitably that the Christological reading will also be the charitable reading. But if the text speaks ubiquitously of Christ, if Christ is love and if love is God, it must follow from all this that there cannot be a Christophany which is not also a theophany. It is from the discovery that Christ is God, as we have said above, that the Church built up its doctrine of the Trinity. Augustine, like his predecessors, holds that we must embrace this tenet before we can search the Scriptures, but in his case the prolegomenon is written not in the liturgy or the pronouncements of a council but in the text itself: that God is love is the key that the text supplies to the interpreter, and without this key we cannot hope to unlock the meaning of a single verse. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This article examines the works of Ante-Necene fathers concerning the Trinity. It traces the evolution of Trinitarian thought from Apostolic Fathers such as Ignatius of Antioch through the Apologists to the great theologians of the late second and early third centuries including Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian. It discusses works on the Trinity in the economy, the emergence of a theology of the Spirit, the theological appropriation of Greek philosophical thought in an effort to explain the faith handed down and the emergence of Trinitarian technical vocabulary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Ante-Necene fathers, Trinity, Trinitarian thought, Apostolic fathers, Ignatius of Antioch, Apologists, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian <b class="calibre3">Apostolic Fathers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">CHRISTIAN authors of the first and second centuries, commonly designated ‘Apostolic Fathers’, spoke about God in terms reminiscent of the New Testament. If we set aside the thorny question of the nature and extent of their knowledge of the texts and traditions of the New Testament, both the New Testament and the Apostolic Fathers use binitarian as well as Trinitarian expressions. At the end of  <i class="calibre4">1 Clement</i>, for example, Clement of Rome ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">96) offers a prayer to the ‘Creator of the universe’ that he will ‘keep intact the precise number of his elect in the whole world through his beloved Child [ <i class="calibre4">pais</i>] Jesus Christ’; the Holy Spirit is mentioned elsewhere in the letter, but not in the prayer ( <i class="calibre4">1 Clement</i> 59,2; Clement 1996: 70). The prayer that Polycarp (d. 156) offered at his martyrdom, however, is Trinitarian. Polycarp blesses the ‘Lord God Almighty, Father’ of his ‘beloved and blessed Servant [ <i class="calibre4">pais</i>] Jesus Christ’ for his own participation in the cup of Christ ‘in the immortality of the Holy Spirit’. Polycarp closes his prayer with a doxology: ‘I praise thee, I bless thee, I glorify thee, through the eternal and heavenly High Priest, Jesus Christ, thy beloved Servant, through whom be glory to thee with him and the Holy Spirit both now and unto the ages to come. Amen’ ( <i class="calibre4">Martyrdom of Polycarp</i> 14; 1996: 154). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> Far and away the fullest theology of the Trinity among the Apostolic Fathers is that of Ignatius (d. 110). For Ignatius, Jesus is the unique Son of God, ‘who was with the Father from eternity and appeared at the end’ ( <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i> 6,1; Ignatius 1996: 95). Ignatius repeatedly refers to God as the Father of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignatius also stresses that the Son is the revealer of the Father. He calls Jesus the ‘guileless mouth by which the Father has spoken truthfully’ ( <i class="calibre4">Romans</i> 8,2; Ignatius 1996: 106), and calls him the ‘knowledge [ <i class="calibre4">gnomê</i>] of God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i> 17,2; Ignatius 1996: 92). Ignatius asserts that the prophets lived like Christ Jesus and were inspired ‘to convince unbelievers  <b class="calibre3">(p. 96) </b>that God is one, and that he has revealed himself in his Son Jesus Christ, who is his Word issuing from the silence and who won the complete approval of him who sent him’ ( <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i> 8,2; Ignatius 1996: 96). Jesus Christ is the sole teacher ( <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i> 9,1;  <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i> 15,1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As is done in many texts of the New Testament, Ignatius calls Jesus ‘God’, and here we find some of Ignatius’ most striking and prescient images. Writing to the Romans lest they impede his martyrdom, he exhorts, ‘Let me imitate the passion of my God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Romans</i> 6,3; Ignatius 1996: 105). In the opening of his letter to the Ephesians, Ignatius praises them as imitators of God who have been stirred by the ‘blood of God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i> 1,1; Ignatius 1996: 87). Weinandy takes such statements to anticipate the communication of idioms and sees Ignatius’ Christology as the forerunner of Chalcedon (Weinandy 2005). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though he has far more to say about the Son, Jesus, Ignatius several times mentions the Holy Spirit, and always in connection with the saving work of the Father and the Son. The action of the Spirit spans the whole economy. He is present to the prophets of the Old Testament who were disciples of Christ by the Spirit ( <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i> 9,2). In one of several creedal passages, Ignatius confesses that ‘our God, Jesus the Christ, was conceived by Mary, in God's plan being sprung from the seed of David and from the Holy Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i> 18,2; Ignatius 1996: 92–3). Finally, the Spirit provides for the unity of the Church in the bishop and in the imitation of Jesus ( <i class="calibre4">Philadelphians</i> 7,2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The texts considered so far and many others besides indicate that Ignatius’ Trinitarian thought is dominated by reflection on the economy of salvation. As we will see later, sometimes economic views of the Trinity in the ante-Nicene period portray the Father as a distant transcendent God and the Son as the God who deals with the world. This is emphatically not the case with Ignatius, as Robin Darling Young has shown. For him, the Church has  <i class="calibre4">henosis</i> with the Father through the bishop and through the ‘acceptance of the reality of Christ's death’ (Young 1999: 337). Young cites a fantastic text from the letter to the Ephesians wherein Ignatius calls them the stones of the Temple of the Father and the domicile of God our Father through the crane of Jesus Christ using the Holy Spirit as a rope ( <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i> 9, 1–2). The Father is, indeed, immanent, dwelling in the hearts of the Ephesians. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> <b class="calibre3">The Apologists</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Age of Apologists follows that of the Apostolic Fathers. A handful of second-century Apologists defended the Christian faith against the malice and prejudice of the Roman Empire. Some of the Apologists, moreover, bring to their Trinitarian reflection a familiarity with Greek philosophical thought and a willingness to use it in explaining the Christian faith to their pagan contemporaries. While it is true that one can find among some of the Apostolic Fathers both an acquaintance with aspects of pagan philosophical thought (one might think of elements of Stoicism in  <i class="calibre4">1 Clement</i>) and a sensitivity to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 97) </b>persecution at the hands of the Empire, with the Apologists we enter a new stage in Trinitarian theology, marked by a more profound interaction with Greek thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his search for the true philosophy, St Justin Martyr (d. 165) turned from one ancient school of Greek philosophy to another until his conversion to Christianity, or ‘Christian philosophy’. St Justin cast a long shadow: he is easily the most important second-century Apologist, and his thought influenced many Christian theologians after him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one were to pick a central idea of Justin's Trinitarian thought it would be his Logos theology. This is true enough, but one must proceed carefully. The temptation has been to reduce Justin to his philosophical sources—and their presence is undeniable—and so to give an account of his understanding of the Logos that is too distant from its New Testament sources. Above all one must never lose sight of the fact that Justin's Logos theology is not about Stoicism, Middle Platonism, or Philonic Hellenistic Judaism; rather it is about Jesus Christ (Baechle, dissertation, 2009). Justin uses the word ‘Logos’ with an intentionally rich and varied range of meanings but, above all, the Logos is Jesus, the Son of God. As Justin writes in the  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i>, ‘we have been taught that Christ is the First-born of God, and we have suggested above that he is the logos of whom every race of men and women were partakers’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 46; Justin 1997: 55). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Logos, the Son, who became Jesus was begotten or conceived, Justin writes in his  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i>, ‘as a beginning before all creatures’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue</i> 61,1; Justin 2003: 94). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Justin does not mention the eternal generation of the Logos but understands him primarily in relation to the economy of salvation. It is the Logos who has been planted or sown (the Logos  <i class="calibre4">spermatikos</i>) among all men who strive to live uprightly ( <i class="calibre4">Second Apology</i> 8). It is the Logos who speaks and acts in the Old Testament. Here we can see most clearly the Son's connection with the economy: he is God immanent; the Father, God transcendent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genesis 19:24 reads, ‘The Lord rained fire from the Lord out of heaven’. The text, writes Justin, ‘indicates that they are two in number: one on earth, who says that he came down to witness the cry of Sodom, and one in heaven, who is the Lord of the Lord on earth and as his Father and God was responsible for his being the mighty one and Lord and God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue</i> 129, 1; Justin 2003: 194). Justin makes the same point in his  <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> wherein he opposes the ‘Jewish’ interpretation of the burning bush theophany which holds that the Father and Demiurge of the universe spoke to Moses. Justin maintains that it was not the Father but the Son who spoke to Moses. Again we get the impression that for Justin the Father is God transcendent and the Son, God immanent, and, of course, the Page 3 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> danger of this kind of thinking is that it logically tends toward subordinationism. Especially in a Platonic framework, the transcendent God is ontologically superior to the immanent God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like so many other ante-Nicenes, Justin confesses the Holy Spirit (third in rank, he says ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 60)) and mentions several times the baptismal formula. Leslie Barnard writes that ‘much of Justin's language about the Spirit has an impersonal ring but the epithet ‘prophetic Spirit’ has a more personal tone’ (Justin 1997: 116, n. 77). Naturally enough, then, Justin's pneumatology is not advanced. There are, however, two famous puzzles in Justin's writings relating to the Spirit. In one case he identifies the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 98) </b>Spirit with the Word: ‘The Spirit and the Power from God cannot therefore be understood as anything else than the Word, who is also the First-begotten of God’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 33; Justin 1997: 46). It is texts such as this one that lead some to call Justin's theology binitarian rather than Trinitarian. In the other case, he interrupts the usual order of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: ‘we worship and honour [the Father] and the Son … and the army of the other good angels … and the prophetic Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">First Apology</i> 6; Justin 1997: 26). In spite of many attempts to make sense of this text, the best reading, in itself difficult to explain, is that Justin offered worship and honour to the Logos’ good angels (Justin 1997: 110, n. </p>
<p class="calibre1">36). In his confession and in liturgical practice, Justin was clearly Trinitarian, though in his theological formulations he is sometimes Trinitarian, sometimes binitarian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems strange on the surface that Theophilus of Antioch, the last Apologist that we will consider, did not speak much about Jesus, and this in spite of the fact that his Trinitarian thought is thoroughly economic. Theophilus, for example, in  <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.180) writes about Scripture, God, his Word and his Wisdom, creation, the resurrection, and other matters, but is silent on Jesus, perhaps, opines Robert Grant, because of apologetic convention, perhaps because of his peculiar Christology (Grant 1988: 165). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theophilus’ theology has both Jewish and Platonic roots: Grant calls him ‘an heir of Hellenistic Judaism’ and compares him with Philo of Alexandria (Grant 1988: 167). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theophilus holds that God transcends human speech, but can be known by his works. God is incomprehensible in glory, unfathomable in greatness, inconceivable in height, incomparable in power, unrivalled in wisdom, inimitable in goodness, and unutterable in kindness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is peculiar that for Theophilus, Father, Word, and Spirit are much like other words predicated of God. In  <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> he writes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I call him Light, I speak of his creature; if I call him Logos, I speak of his beginning; if I call him Mind, I speak of his intelligence; if I call him Spirit, I speak of his breath; if I call him Sophia (Wisdom), I speak of his offspring; if I call him Strength, I speak of his might … if I call him Father, I speak of him as all things; if I call him Fire, I speak of his wrath. ( <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 1,3; Theophilus 1970: 5) Page 4 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> Again, Theophilus will say, following Psalm 32:6, that God made all things by his Word and Wisdom, but in the same text also that God prepared the heavens by knowledge and broke up the fountains of the deep by understanding. These texts seem to imply that, for Theophilus, Father, Word, and Wisdom, are not, as later theologians would say, distinct persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This, however, is not the whole story. Explaining his understanding of creation, Theophilus writes that God ‘having his own Logos innate ( <i class="calibre4">endiathetos</i>) in his own bowels, generated him together with his own Sophia, vomiting him forth before everything else’ ( <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 2,10; Theophilus 1970: 39). The Word, then, is generated for the economy, a point confirmed later when Autolycus asked Theophilus how God can be said to walk in paradise when he cannot be contained in a place. Theophilus explains: <b class="calibre3">(p. 99)</b> The God and Father of the universe is unconfined and is not present in a place…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But his Logos, through whom he made all things, who is his  <i class="calibre4">Power and Wisdom</i> (1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cor. 1:24), assuming the role of the Father and Lord of the universe, was present in paradise in the role of God and conversed with Adam. ( <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 2,22; Theophilus 1970: 63)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice that Adam heard was the Word of God, ‘who is also his Son’. The begetting of the Son, however, is not to be understood after the manner of the pagan gods. Rather, the Word always resided in the heart of God and was with God as a counsellor, his own mind and thought. ‘When God wished to make what he had planned to make, he generated this Logos, making him external ( <i class="calibre4">prophorikos</i>), as the firstborn of all creation [Col. 1:15] without emptying himself of Reason’ ( <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 2,22; Theophilus 1970: 63). In these two texts we see an important (and, by later standards, erroneous) distinction, that Theophilus was the first to make explicitly, between the Word immanent ( <i class="calibre4">Logos endiathetos</i>) and the Word expressed ( <i class="calibre4">Logos prophorikos</i>). Of course, with this distinction in place, the Word is eternal but his generation or expression is not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theophilus’ understanding of Wisdom is not so much immature as confused. In the same passage ( <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 2,10) he speaks of him as distinct from the Word and identifies him with the Word and the Spirit of God. ‘Probably’, Grant tries to explain, ‘Theophilus reflects both the earlier doctrine, according to which God's agent and aide was Sophia, and the later doctrine, which replaced Sophia with Logos’ (Grant 1988: 169). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Irenaeus, Clement, and Origen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The age of the Apologists obviously ends with the conversion of Constantine and the toleration of Christianity in 313, but long before the intellectual centre of gravity in Christianity shifted away from the state and towards internal doctrinal differences. The shift was not abrupt. Apologists like Justin had also written works against the Gnostic interpretation of Christianity, and anti-Gnostic writers like Clement and Origen wrote in defence of the faith against pagans. At the very least, we can say that the most significant theological reflection on the Trinity after Theophilus occurs not in apologetic works but in Page 5 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> polemic with other Christians: Gnostics on the one hand and Monarchians on the other. It is in works against these two mistakes that our remaining cohort of ante-Nicene theologians—Irenaeus, Clement, Origen, and Tertullian—will work out their understanding of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gnosticism was not a monolithic or highly institutionalized form of Christianity, but a collection of sects loosely connected by a set of common basic beliefs. Gnostics interpreted the events of salvation history reported in the Old and New Testaments, from creation to Jesus, in the light of a fundamental myth (and the details of the myths vary  <b class="calibre3">(p. 100) </b>from sect to sect). The world-view contained in the myth is always dualistic, positing opposition between spirit and matter and sometimes also the authors of spirit and matter, a good God and an evil creator God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monarchianism, like Gnosticism, names not a single group but several ways of thinking about God and Jesus whose common emphasis is the unity of God against the allegedly ditheistic Logos theology of theologians like St Justin. While Monarchians differ one from another, their theology tends to take two forms: modalism or adoptionism. Some, like Sabellius of Rome, confess one God who is now Father, now Son, now Holy Spirit. The three names do not refer to three individuals or three persons, but to the different ways or modes of acting of the one God. Such a thinker could, of course, hold that God became incarnate, but he would not hold that the Son became incarnate and not the Father, for there is no distinction between Father and Son: they are two names for the same ‘person’. Others, like Theodotus the Shoemaker, hold that Father and Son are indeed distinct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus, who was a mere man but an exceptionally virtuous man, became God's (adopted) Son at his baptism. Because the sources are scant, very little can be said with certainty about the two kinds of Monarchians. Whatever one says about them, it is certainly true that Monarchian errors are the backdrop for a great deal of third-century reflection on the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Irenaeus</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert Grant calls St Irenaeus ‘the most important Christian controversialist and theologian between the apostles and the third-century genius Origen’, and compares his theology to a Gothic cathedral. It is strongly supported by columns of biblical faith and tradition, illuminated by vast expanses of exegetical and logical argument, and upheld by flying buttresses of rhetorical and philosophical considerations from the outside. (Grant 1997: 1) This image well communicates how Irenaeus took up ideas from the Apologists, especially Justin, to explain the Christian faith against Valentinian Gnosticism. Gnostic thought threatened apostolic Christianity as Irenaeus understood it by positing division where there must, for the sake of our salvation, be unity. The Gnostics divide God from his Word and Spirit, the Word from his flesh, the Spirit from his prophets, the creator from the Page 6 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> physical world, creation from redemption, the Old Testament from the New, and man from his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On many occasions, Irenaeus distils the preaching of the Apostles into a rule of faith, and the various expressions of the rule of faith typically confess the Father as the creator of the world as well as the genuine incarnation, passion, and death of the Son. Thus, the rule of faith is, above all, anti-Gnostic. One of the bizarre (to us) features of Gnosticism is the Pleroma, the Godhead, which consists of many beings related to one another by a complex set of emanations. Irenaeus saw this as ridiculous speculation, completely unfounded in revelation. If ‘anyone asks’, he writes in  <i class="calibre4">Against Heresies</i>, ‘what was God <b class="calibre3">(p. 101) </b>doing before he made the world? we reply that the answer to such a question lies with God himself’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 2,28,3; Irenaeus 1885: 400). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though Irenaeus is not inclined to speculate about God in himself, he clearly attributes pre-existence to the Son and the Spirit. Like Theophilus before him, Irenaeus considered the Son and the Spirit the hands of God ( <i class="calibre4">To Autolycus</i> 2,18, e.g.  <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 4,20,1). Unlike Theophilus, Irenaeus rejects any analogy between human speech and the generation of the Word. God is not sometimes silent, sometimes speaking; rather, ‘God being all Mind, and all Logos, both speaks exactly what he thinks, and thinks exactly what he speaks’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 2,28,5; Irenaeus 1885: 400). Irenaeus says even that ‘the Word, that is the Son, was always with the Father’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 4,20,3; Irenaeus 1885: 488) and that ‘the Son, eternally co-existing with the Father … always reveals the Father to angels … and all to whom he wills that God should be revealed’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 2,30,9; Irenaeus 1885: 406). Nonetheless, it is not clear whether or not Irenaeus here anticipates later statements of the eternal generation of the Son, for in both of these texts the context is economic. At his core, the Son is a saviour. His creative and revealing activity, his incarnation, of course, and passion and resurrection are all saving activities. ‘From the beginning’, the existence of the Son is bound up with man, for man is made in his likeness, and he exists to save man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For inasmuch as he had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 3,22,3; Irenaeus 1885: 455; Weinandy 2003: 25–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irenaeus has a more mature pneumatology than his predecessors. There is no confusion of the Spirit with the Word, as the Spirit is assigned a distinct role in the economy of salvation. The Spirit is the Wisdom in whom God freely and spontaneously made all things ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 4,20,1). He ministers to the Father along with the Son, but angels are subject to the both of them ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 4,7,4). The Spirit was poured forth in the Old Testament and by his influence the Father was revealed ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. 4,20,6). Weinandy well sums up the role of the Spirit in the new dispensation: ‘through faith and baptism the Christian comes to partake of this risen life through the Holy Spirit [and] it is the Holy Spirit that molds and fashions us into the image of Jesus, and in this way we take on the likeness of the Father as his children’ (Weinandy 2003: 30; Haer. 5,6,1). For Irenaeus the Spirit's activity is both inseparable and distinct from that of the Father and the Son. ‘Those who bear the Spirit of God’, he writes in his  <i class="calibre4">Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching</i>, ‘are led to the Word, that Page 7 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> is to the Son, while the Son presents [them] to the Father, and the Father furnishes incorruptibility’ ( <i class="calibre4">Demonstration</i> 7; Irenaeus 1997: 44). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attempt to analyse Irenaeus’ rich thought from the vantage point of third- and fourth-century theological tendencies has generated a large body of scholarly literature. Dennis Minns believes that some passages in Irenaeus seem modalistic while others, subordinationist; ‘we should admit that he did not address the question directly and that his remarks which seem to bear upon it have, in fact, another purpose’ (Minns 2010: 63–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minns ends up arguing, I think rightly, that Irenaeus was neither modalist nor subordinationist. More than understandable, it must be expected that Irenaeus would not tease out the ontological implication of economic trinitarianism in the way that later theologians would. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 102) Clement</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Irenaeus’ writings were diffused widely almost immediately, and Clement of Alexandria (d. 215) knew  <i class="calibre4">Against Heresies</i>. Irenaeus, however, was not Clement's only source, for he drew upon the Hellenic Jew Philo as well as a wide array of pagan Greek authors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clement is commonly acknowledged to be thoroughly Hellenized, and one can easily see why. Nevertheless, and despite his many philosophic debts, we do well to remember that for Clement the Scriptures are  <i class="calibre4">the</i> privileged source for knowledge about God. Indeed Osborn stresses that in reading Clement one must have before one's eyes three problems that Clement wished to solve (Osborn 2005: 4), and one of these bears directly on his Trinitarian thought: the Gospels proclaim one God, yet how can Father and Son be one God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clement's problem, then, comes not from philosophy but from revelation, though he uses Middle Platonic philosophy to help answer the problem. Drawing upon the Middle Platonic understanding of Mind in relation to One, Clement writes in the  <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> that God cannot be a ‘subject for demonstration’, but that the Son, who is Wisdom, Knowledge, and Truth is ‘susceptible of demonstration and of description’ ( <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 4,25; Clement 1885b: 438). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clement casts the relationship between the Father and the Son in largely cosmological and metaphysical terms. The nature of the Son is ‘nearest to him who is alone the almighty One, is the most perfect’, holy, kingly, and beneficent ( <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 7,2; Clement 1885b: 524). The Son orders all things in accordance with the Father's will; he is the ‘paternal Word, exhibiting the holy administration for him who put [all] in subjection to him’ ( <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 7,2; Clement 1885b: 524). The Son is responsible for the Christian revelation of God and ‘gave philosophy to the Greeks by means of inferior angels’ ( <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 7,2; Clement 1885b: 524). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clement writes in his  <i class="calibre4">Instructor</i> ( <i class="calibre4">Paedagogus</i>) that the Father is simply one, in fact, ‘more than one, beyond unity’ ( <i class="calibre4">Paedagogus</i> 1,8,71; Clement 1954: 63), while the Son is ‘one thing as all things’, ‘for he is the circle of all powers rolled and united into one unity’ ( <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 4,25; Clement 1885b: 438). Thus the Son is a metaphysical mediator, Page 8 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> ontologically subordinate to the One as he brings the many into contact with it (I think the subordinationist tendency in Clement is stronger than Feulner thinks it is (Feulner 2006: 164–7)). This position makes God the Word the ideal tutor and loving educator of man. While Clement's philosophical analysis of divine unity would not measure up to later standards, the all-transcendent God is not indifferent to his creation; rather Clement constantly stresses the love and concern of both the Father and the Son for their creatures, especially man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Holy Spirit is often called by Clement the ‘prophetic Spirit’ working in the Old Testament (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">Paedagogus</i> 1,5,12). Beyond this role, the Spirit plays a part in the new dispensation by drawing us to a life of virtue (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">Stromateis</i> 7,2) and is the baptismal Light in which we see Light ( <i class="calibre4">Paedagogus</i> 1,6,28). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clement closes the  <i class="calibre4">Instructor</i> with a beautiful prayer that well reflects the contours and emphases of his Trinitarian thought: <b class="calibre3">(p. 103)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Be gracious, O Instructor, to us thy Children, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father, Charioteer of Israel, Son and Father, both in One, Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opening lines focus on the Father and the Son in the teaching economy, and the prayer is addressed to the two of them. Only half-way through the prayer is the Spirit mentioned:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Do thou thyself cause that all of us who have our conversation in thy peace … may be wafted in calm by thy Holy Spirit, by the ineffable Wisdom … and [praise and thank] the Alone Father and Son, Son and Father, the Son, Instructor and Teacher, with the Holy Spirit, all in One [the Son] in whom is all, for whom all is one, for whom is eternity, whose members we all are, whose glory the aeons are. ( <i class="calibre4">Paedagogus</i> 1,12,101; Clement 1885a: 295) The Father and Son are primary but the Spirit participates in the work of the Son. Also, one can hear here echoes of Clement's Middle Platonism, especially in his confession of the unity of all in the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Origen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Clement had often promised to write a work on first principles, notes Charles Kannengiesser, and Origen (d. 254) delivered on that promise (Kannengiesser 1988: 238–41). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For this Origen is thought to be the first systematic theologian, and, indeed, there had never before been a work like  <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i>, in which one sees a comprehensive and sweeping vision of Christianity in opposition to the Marcionites. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Kannengiesser argues, are the First Principles: ‘thus there are three first principles in one Godhead, according to Origen, the Holy Spirit being also a first principle of salvation, like the Father and the Son’ (Kannengiesser 1988: 246). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> Origen's theological reflection on the Trinity, like Clement's, is deeply indebted to Middle Platonic thought. Origen, however, would have us remember that ‘the knowledge which calls men to lead a good and blessed life [derives] from no other source but the very words and teaching of Christ’ ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1, preface, 1; Origen 1973: 1). Even in his mistaken ideas—if we judge by a later standard—Origen is attempting to explain biblical revelation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> opens with a long exposition of the Trinity which is recapitulated at the end of the work. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not considered apart from the economy of creation and redemption. The Trinity, for Origen, is the ‘blessed and ruling power </p>
<p class="calibre1">… that exercises control of all things’ ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,4,3; Origen 1973: 41). God is his creative and beneficent power, and, so, it is ‘absurd and impious to suppose that these powers of God have been at any time in abeyance for a single moment’ ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,4,3; Origen 1973: 41). Origen draws the conclusion that either creation always exists, or, at least, creation is always present and prefigured in the always existing Wisdom, who is the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen writes of the Son in straightforward scriptural language, rather than the subtle (and still scriptural in its own way) language of the centuries after him. The Son is begotten of the Father's will (which Arius would say in his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia). He is the ‘image of the invisible God’ (Col. 1:15), ‘the effulgence of his glory  <b class="calibre3">(p. 104) </b>and the impress of his substance’ (Heb. 1:3), the ‘firstborn of all creation’ (Col. 1:15). He is a creature in a qualified sense, Wisdom, as Prov. 8:22 has it ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 4,4,1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover the Son is always existing and has no beginning: there is no ‘time when he did not exist’ (a point that Arius would deny in the same aforementioned letter) ( <i class="calibre4">On First</i> <i class="calibre4">Principles</i> 4,4,1; Origen 1973: 314). </p>
<p class="calibre1">To explain the union that obtains between the Father and the Son, Origen draws an analogy with the union that obtains between the Word and his soul, which, in Origen's thought, pre-exists, like every soul, the creation of the body. The Word is united in a ‘spotless partnership’ to its human soul and the same harmony of wills obtains between the Father and the Son, but Origen also speaks often of a natural union ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 4,4,4; Origen 1973: 319). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen is very clearly a subordinationist ( <i class="calibre4">pace</i> Killian McDonnell 1994, who tries to clear him of the charge by arguing that Origen's language is economic and not ontological; Origen's texts seem both economic and ontological). The Son, for example, does not know the Father as clearly as the Father knows himself ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 4,4,8), and the Son has a smaller sphere of providence to correspond to his lower level of being: The God and Father, who holds the universe together, is superior to every being that exists, for he imparts to each one from his own existence that which each one is; the Son, being less than the Father, is superior to rational creatures alone (for he is second to the Father). ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,3,5; Origen 1973: 33–4) Page 10 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> Moreover, the Lord taught us to pray not to him but to the Father, ‘for if … the Son is distinct from the Father in essence and in underlying reality ( <i class="calibre4">kat’ ousian kai hupokeimenon</i>), then we should pray to the Son and not to the Father, or to them both, or to the Father alone’ ( <i class="calibre4">On Prayer</i> 15,1; Origen 2004: 147). The first two alternatives are absurd and unscriptural; so, we should ‘pray to God the Father of all alone, but not apart from the high priest’ ( <i class="calibre4">On Prayer</i> 15,1; Origen 2004: 147). Of course, Origen sees his subordinationism in the Scriptures: after all, John the Evangelist refers to the Father as ‘the God’ and the Logos as just ‘God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Commentary on John</i> 2, § 12–18). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Father is superior to the Son, so the Son is to the Spirit. The Spirit is less than the Son, for his sphere of providence is limited to the saints: ‘the working of the power of God the Father and God the Son is spread indiscriminately over all created beings, but a share in the Holy Spirit is possessed, we find, by the saints alone’ ( <i class="calibre4">On First Principles</i> 1,3,7; Origen 1973: 36–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Explaining Jn 1:3 (‘all things were made through him’), Origen maintains that the Holy Spirit came to existence through the Word because the Word is ‘older than he’ ( <i class="calibre4">Commentary on John</i> 2, § 73; Origen 1989: 113). The ‘Holy Spirit is the most honoured of all things which came to be through the Word’ and is the first in rank ‘of all the things which came to existence by the Father through Christ’ ( <i class="calibre4">Commentary on John</i> 2, § 75; Origen 1989: 114, translation slightly modified). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great danger of subordinationism is that it tends toward polytheism: if the Son and Spirit are subordinate to the Father and yet all three are God, one cannot but conclude that they are three discrete beings, three gods. Origen is unintimidated by this danger. In his  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Heraclides</i>, who was a monarchian, Origen puts to him this  <b class="calibre3">(p. 105)</b> question: ‘Is it not true … that we do not hesitate to speak in one sense of two Gods, and in another sense of one God?’ ( <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Heraclides</i> 2; Origen 1992: 58). Heraclides evades the question, but Origen will not let him obscure the point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen said: ‘And the two Gods become a unity?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heraclides said: ‘Yes’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen said: ‘We profess two Gods?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heraclides said: ‘Yes, [but] the power is one’. (Dialogue with Heraclides 2; Origen 1992: 59)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Heraclides got the last word of the exchange, Origen's victory was total. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Origen's thought in general and his Trinitarian thought in particular have been a constant source of dispute from ancient times to modern. He has always had detractors and defenders, those who make him the father of Nicene orthodoxy (he did confess that the Son is consubstantial with the Father together with a distinction of  <i class="calibre4">hypostases</i>) on the one hand or the father of Arius on the other. The truth, I think, lies somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is in Origen's thought an inherent tension that calls for resolution in one direction Page 11 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> (Nicene orthodoxy) or another (Arianism). Origen himself is aware of this tension. He knows when his thought is speculative, tentative, or offensive; he knows when his theological positions reach beyond the apostolic faith handed down to him even as he attempts to give a rational account of that very faith. It was left to his many intellectual and ecclesiastical heirs to sort out which positions were truly consistent with the apostolic faith and which were foreign to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The West: Tertullian</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now we must backtrack a bit and turn to the West, for with the writings of Tertullian (d.  <i class="calibre4">c</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">.220), whose career in Carthage overlaps with Clement's in Alexandria, we see the emergence of Western Latin Trinitarian thought. Tertullian set himself against the Gnostic thought of Marcion and the modalist thought of Praxeas (about whom we know next to nothing). Against Marcion he taught that there is one God creator of all, including the physical world, and against Praxeas that there are lasting and meaningful distinctions among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the outset of  <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i>, Tertullian confesses the rule of faith that has come down to him from the beginning. We ‘believe’, he writes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that there is one only God, but under the following dispensation, or  <i class="calibre4">oikonomia</i>, … </p>
<p class="calibre1">that this one only God has also a Son, his Word, who proceeded from himself … </p>
<p class="calibre1">[and] who sent also from heaven from the Father, according to his own promise, the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, the sanctifier of the faith of those who believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost. ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 2; Tertullian 1885: 598)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tertullian offers an economic trinitarianism indebted to Theophilus of Antioch. Before all things God was alone, although he had Reason always with him, ‘as he silently planned <b class="calibre3">(p. 106) </b>and arranged within himself everything which he was afterwards about to utter through his Word’ ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 5; Tertullian 1885: 600). The Word, uttered at creation, is not a mere attribute of God but a substantive being and Son ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it is with the Word, so also with the Spirit: ‘the connection of the Father in the Son, and of the Son in the Paraclete, produces three coherent persons, who are yet distinct one from another’ ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 25; Tertullian 1885: 621). ‘The Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as he from whom he proceeds’ ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 26; Tertullian 1885: 622). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Operating within a Stoic philosophical framework, wherein spirit, including God, is rarified matter, Tertullian worked out some important conceptual and linguistic distinctions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three persons ( <i class="calibre4">personae</i>), three ‘not in condition [ <i class="calibre4">statu</i>], but in degree [ <i class="calibre4">gradu</i>], not in substance [ <i class="calibre4">substantia</i>], but in form [ <i class="calibre4">forma</i>], not in power </p>
<p class="calibre1">[ <i class="calibre4">potestate</i>], but in aspect [ <i class="calibre4">specie</i>]; yet of one substance, and of one condition, and of one power’ ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 2; Tertullian 1885: 598). Osborn calls attention also to Tertullian's use of the category of ‘relative disposition’ which anticipates Augustine's un</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Ante-Nicene Fathers</b> derstanding of relation in Trinitarian theology. ‘Father and Son’, he writes, ‘have their existence in their disposition alone; therefore, when that disposition is denied, they cease to be… A father makes a son and a son makes a father’ (Osborn 1997: 127; Against Praxeas 10). </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What then did Tertullian achieve? He handed on a form of discourse, which opened the way to further development, and above all a formula, “one substance in three persons” ’ (Osborn 1997: 138, citing Moingt 1966–9). Beyond this he was the first to use the word ‘Trinity’, the first to say that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were of one substance, and the first to say that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are persons. Tertullian came up with some unforgettable images for the Trinity: Father, Son, and Spirit are like root, shoot, and fruit; spring, river, and stream; or sun, ray, and point of light ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 8). And finally Tertullian proposed a psychological analogy to explain the relationship between the Father and the Son: ‘And that you may the more readily understand this,’ he writes, ‘consider first of all, from your own self, who are made “in the image and likeness of God”, for what purpose it is that you also possess reason in yourself’ ( <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> 5; Tertullian 1885: 600). All these points foreshadow the thought of Augustine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">All ante-Nicene Trinitarian theology gives an ‘account’, a  <i class="calibre4">logos</i> (see 1 Pet. 3:15), for the Trinitarian faith of the Gospel. Ignatius deeply penetrated and brilliantly summarized the Church's faith in Father, Son, and Spirit without the help (and the dangers) of the Greek philosophical tradition embraced by the Apologists upon whom Irenaeus was a clear improvement. Clement, Origen, and Tertullian carry on the basic project of the Apologists in a new context. It would be the work of fourth- and fifth-century theologians to pick up the insights and leave behind the deficiencies of second- and third-century understandings of the Father and the Son, and to carry still further the emerging theology of the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 107) Suggested Reading</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no substitute for reading the texts of the Fathers first hand. Cyril Richardson's <i class="calibre4">Early Christian Fathers</i> (New York: Touchstone, 1996) contains many wonderful texts from the Apostolic Fathers (including Ignatius) as well excerpts from Irenaeus, and would be a good starting point. For scholarly guides to the whole ante-Nicene period, J. N. D. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly's  <i class="calibre4">Early Christine Doctrines</i> (San Francisco: Harper, 1978) is still valuable if at times dated. One will find a much more recent treatment in J. Behr (2001). On Gnosticism, see Logan (1996). </p>
