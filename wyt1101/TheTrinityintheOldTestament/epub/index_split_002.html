<p class="calibre1">This article offers a nuanced account of the fourth-century Trinitarian controversies. It shows how the fundamentally exegetical controversies began with Arius' insistence on the unique divine prerogatives of the Father and continued with decades of debate over the appropriateness of the word  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i>, which had been rejected by third-century synods in Antioch because of concerns about modalism. It argues that the doctrine of the Trinity that emerged in the years leading up to the Council of Constantinople in 381 was not so much a philosophical dispute as it was a conflict over the interpretation of Scripture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian controversy, fourth-century, exegetical controversies, Arius, divine prerogatives, homoousios, modalism, Antioch, Council of Constantinople, interpretation of Scripture THE theological controversies of the fourth century that began with Arius and culminated in the Council of Constantinople (381) are commonly spoken of in monolithic terms as the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Arian Controversy’ or the ‘Trinitarian Controversy’. Yet these titles are misleading. First, although the first major controversy arose from the clash between the Egyptian presbyter Arius and his bishop Alexander of Alexandria, after his condemnation at the Council of Nicaea (325) Arius and his theology ceased to be influential, except as a polemical label that supporters of Nicaea liberally attached to their enemies. Second, while the ontological relation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit was a major point of contention, the Trinity was by no means the only disputed subject. Rather the Trinity stood out as the most important subject in a constellation of related theological loci, including epistemology, the Incarnation, and Biblical interpretation. For in the fourth century, theology was not broken down into discrete loci. The Son's coeternal relationship with the Father was inseparable from the Son's salvific work in the Incarnation. Thus there was not one controversy about the Trinity but many controversies, some theological some not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity that emerged in the years leading up to the Council of Constantinople in 381 was not so much a philosophical dispute as it was a conflict over the interpretation of Scripture. In the end, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan formula provided a Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> fourth-century version of the Rule of Faith that established the theological pattern or grammar to guide both the Church's reading of Scripture and its articulation of the apostolic faith in its liturgy, hymns, preaching, and catechesis. This grammar for Christian speech about God gained its ascendancy through a process of theological performance in ecclesial practices, such as Gregory of Nazianzus's  <i class="calibre4">Theological Orations</i>, that narrated the essential unity of Scripture's polyphonic depictions of Christ as both one with the Father and yet distinct (Ayres 2004: 81). In the eyes of the late fourth-century defenders of Nicaea, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan creed that became Church dogma merely formalized the rules for Christian speech already implicit in the logic of the biblical  <b class="calibre3">(p. 110) </b>witness. However, the logic of Nicaea that seemed incontrovertible in 381 was not so obvious in 318. The language and logic of the grammar unfolded gradually in the theological imagination of Nicaea's supporters and critics alike. Therefore, the fourth-century doctrine of the Trinity must be seen as a work in progress and so its evolution needs to be traced out chronologically. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b> <b class="calibre3">From Arius to Constantinople: The Road toward Trinitarian Consensus</b> <b class="calibre3">Phase 1:</b> <b class="calibre3">Alexander and Arius (313–25)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the decades following Diocletian's persecution (305–6), the Egyptian Church was divided between followers of Peter Patriarch of Alexandria and Melitius of Lycopolis, a wandering bishop, who gained disciples when Peter fled persecution. In 313, Alexander became bishop of Alexandria and sought to restore unity to the Egyptian Church through promoting doctrinal unity. Around 318, Alexander wrote a circular letter establishing a model of right teaching. In the letter, Alexander declared that the Son was eternally correlative with the Father. Employing Origen's language of ‘eternal generation’ Alexander argued that the Son, as the Word and Wisdom of the Father, is intrinsic to the being of God and so is the perfect image of God. Arius, a popular priest who lost to Alexander in the episcopal election, criticized Alexander for compromising the uniqueness of the Father. In 320 Arius wrote a creedal statement,  <i class="calibre4">the Thalia</i>, laying out his alternative. God is unique in his essence being ‘alone ingenerate, alone eternal, alone without beginning … </p>
<p class="calibre1">alone immortal’ and being unapproachable, unknowable, and ineffable. Consequently, Arius argued, God can be known only through a mediator or Son who is the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> mentioned in John's prologue that serves as God's agent of creation and finally becomes incarnate in a human body where he suffers and dies. Unlike the eternal, ingenerate, and immutable Father, the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> or Word was created by fiat from the Father's will. Arius’ affirmation of the radical transcendence and uniqueness of God went so far as to say, ‘The Father remains ineffable to the Son, and the Word can neither see nor know the Father perfectly and accurately’. The Son can reveal the Father only in as much as he is the perfect reflection of the Father's will. Moreover, since the Father who begat the Son is necessarily prior to the Son, the Son cannot be coeternal with the Father. Consequently, Arius adopted the slogan, ‘there was once when the Son was not’. Arius’  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> was ontological</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> ly subordinate to the Father. Eventually forced to leave Egypt, Arius gained episcopal support from Eusebius of Nicomedia, Eusebius of Caesarea, and Asterius, collectively known as the Eusebians. <b class="calibre3">(p. 111) </b>In 323 Alexander condemned Arius; Eusebius of Nicomedia responded by condemning Alexander. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Phase 2:</b> <b class="calibre3">The Council of Nicaea and its Aftermath (325–35)</b> Concerned about the division within the Egyptian Church, Constantine summoned a council of eastern and western bishops in June 325 at Nicaea to address the theological disagreement between Alexander and Arius. The Council generated a creedal statement that repudiated Arius’ doctrine. Contrary to Arius’ claim that the Father's nature (οὐσίσ) is unique, Nicaea declared that the Son was begotten ‘from the substance (οὐσίσς) of the Father’ and therefore was ‘of the same being (ὁμοούσιος) with the Father’. Confessing that the Son was ‘begotten’ rather than ‘made’ distinguished the Son from creatures implying equality in divinity with the Father, ‘True God from True God’. Nicaea affirmed that Father and Son were coeternal by its condemnation of Arius’ slogan, ‘There was once when he was not’. Being coeternal with the Father was a necessary corollary of consubstantiality. Were the Son created from nothing, his Creator necessarily would have existed before the Son. Thus Nicaea confirmed Alexander's position that the Son is intrinsic to the Father's being. The immediate result of Nicaea was that Arius was excommunicated and sent into exile. Although Eusebius of Nicomedia unenthusiastically signed the creed, he nevertheless refused to sign the condemnations of Arius. However, shortly after Nicaea, an assembly of bishops in Nicomedia readmitted Arius to communion. Alexander sent his secretary and protégé Athanasius to Constantine to protest. After Alexander's death in April 328, he was succeeded as bishop by Athanasius, who would become Nicaea's chief defender over the next thirty years. Immediately, Athanasius drew the enmity of the Eusebians and their new-found allies the Melitians. Their attack upon Athanasius was not for doctrinal error but for episcopal malfeasance, including murder, and ultimately led Constantine to exile Athanasius. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Phase 3:</b> <b class="calibre3">Anti-Marcellan Phase (336–58)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Few signers of Nicaea were fully satisfied with the creed, especially its use of the term ὁμοούσιος, which had been rejected earlier at synods in Antioch (264, 268). Critics were troubled by the materialist connotation of the Son's being begotten from the οὐσία of the Father, as if the Son were begotten by a subdivision of the Father's substance. Moreover, although Nicaea used ὁμοούσιος to express the unity of Father and Son, it failed to qualify ὁμοούσιος in a way that preserved the New Testament distinction between Father and Son. Without expressing the difference between them, the creed's use of ὁμοούσιος implied that Father and Son were one and the same entity thus sounding Sabellian or modalist, i.e. the Son is not really distinct from the Father but merely a mode of God's self-revelation. This  <b class="calibre3">(p. 112) </b>perception was only confirmed when Athanasius allied himself with Marcellus of Ancyra. For Marcellus, the Word was not eternally distinct from the Father but was eternally in the Father. At the creation of the world, however, the Word </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘came forth’ as the creating and redeeming ἐνέργεια or activity of the Father. Marcellus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> disciple Photinus of Sirmium went so far as to insist that there were not three hypostases but only one. To the Eusebians, the Word's ‘coming forth’ as the Father's activity suggested that the Son was not truly distinct from the Father but was simply the form of the Father in action and thus Sabellian. Consequently, Marcellus’ support for Nicaea and the language of ὁμοούσιος only confirmed the Eusebians’ suspicions that Nicaea was a modalist creed. Therefore the Eusebians challenged Nicaea and the language of ὁμοούσιος by attacking Marcellus. In 336 at the first Council of Constantinople, Marcellus was condemned as a modalist and deposed from his see. Marcellus was succeeded by the anti-Nicene, Basil of Ancyra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Athanasius, even during exile, fired a polemical barrage against the Eusebians with his <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i>. The rhetorical effect of this work was to tar his opponents with the label ‘Arian’ even though few of the Eusebians affirmed Arius’ theology. From Athanasius’ perspective, however, the Eusebians’ subordinationism was tantamount to Arius’ declaring the Son a creature. Unless the Son is  <i class="calibre4">equal</i> in divinity with the Father, the Son is not fully and truly God and so cannot mediate the divine nature to humanity necessary for salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 341 at a council in Antioch, the anti-Nicenes issued the anti-modalist ‘Dedication Creed’ that emphasized the independent and eternal existence of the Son who is ‘the exact image of the divinity, οὐσία, will, power, and glory of the Father’. Thus the Eusebian strategy to deal with the problematic language of Nicaea was to interpret it in a way that established the distinction between the Father and the Son. Although the council anathematized those who claimed that there was any period before the Father's begetting the Son and those who spoke of the Son as ‘a creature like one of the creatures’, Marcellus and Athanasius saw the Dedication Creed as contrary to the meaning of Nicaea. Consequently, when a council was summoned at Serdica in 343, there was an impasse between the eastern supporters of the Dedication Creed who opposed Athanasius and the western bishops who supported Athanasius and rejected the Dedication Creed condemning those who claimed Father, Son, and Spirit were distinct and separate hypostases. The next year, another Council of Antioch drew up the Macrostich Creed that affirmed the Dedication Creed but avoided language of οὐσία and ὑπόστασις and instead spoke of Father, Son, and Spirit as ‘objects’ (πράγματα) or ‘persons’ (πρόσωπα). In 351, at the first Council of Sirmium, Basil of Ancyra prosecuted Photinus for modalism and condemned him, along with Marcellus and Athanasius. Although Sirmium declared that the Son is subordinate to the Father, the council, nevertheless, insisted that the Son of Mary is also the Son of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Basil of Ancyra shared the Eusebians’ dissatisfaction with ὁμοούσιος, he was equally concerned with their subordination of the Son. He was even more troubled by the radical subordination of the Son advocated by Aetius and Eunomius, who argued that the Father is absolutely wholly unlike (ἀνόμοιος) the Son in essence. Basil responded by calling a council at Ancyra in 358. His goal was to offer a middle position between the modalistic language of Nicaea and Athanasius on the one hand and the radical subordinationism of Aetius and Eunomius on the other hand. Basil's alternative was to say that  <b class="calibre3">(p. 113) </b>the Son was ὁμοιούσιος or ‘like’ (ὅ μοιος) the Father ‘according to his essence (οὐσία)’. Contra Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> the Council of Sirmium of 351 that avoided οὐσία, Basil argued that οὐσία was acceptable if understood to be immaterial and indivisible. Moreover, unless the Son was generated from the Father's οὐσία, then he was made from nothing and so was a mere creature fashioned by the Father his Creator. Ὁμοιούσιος was preferable to ὁμοούσιος because ὁμοιούσιος recognized a difference between the Father and Son—they were  <i class="calibre4">similar</i> in essence, not the  <i class="calibre4">same</i> being—thus avoiding the modalist error of conflating Father and Son. The Council of Ancyra exiled Aetius and Eunomius. Thus after Ancyra, the Church was roughly divided into three factions: the pro-Nicenes of Athanasius and the western bishops, Basil's Homoiousian party, and the next generation of anti-Nicenes called the Homoians because they spoke of the Son as ‘like’ (ὅ μοιος) the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Phase 4:</b> <b class="calibre3">Ascendancy of the Homoians (353–70)</b> Whereas the Eusebians had countered the problematic language of ὁμοούσιος by the reinterpretation of Nicaea, the goal of the Homoians was to overturn Nicaea altogether. The principle leaders of the Homoian faction, Valens of Mursa and Ursacius of Singidunum, veiled their anti-Nicene agenda by focusing upon Athanasius whose disobedience to the emperor had earned him expulsion from Alexandria three times between 339 and 359. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the support of Constantius II, they summoned a council at Arles in 353 ostensibly to condemn Athanasius. Eusebius of Vercelli and Pope Liberius of Rome, discerning their theological agenda, called for the council to reaffirm Nicaea alongside the censure of Athanasius. The council was dissolved. In 355 and 356, Valens and Ursacius now with Constantius II's support convened councils at Milan and Beziers deposing pro-Nicene bishops, including Eusebius of Vercelli, Dionysius of Milan, Liberius of Rome, and Hilary of Poitiers, because they would not endorse the condemnation of Athanasius. In 357 at the second Council of Sirmium, the anti-Nicenes issued an Homoian creed that rejected οὐσία language as un-Scriptural (reaffirming the Council of Antioch 344), prohibited discussion of the Son's generation, which according to Isa. 53:8 is known only to the Father and Son, and affirmed that the name ‘Father’ indicates his superiority to the Son ‘in honour, virtue, power, dignity, glory, and majesty’. The next year, 359, the Homoians convened councils at Seleucia and Ariminum to ratify the Homoian creed by eastern and western bishops. At Ariminum, Valens put forward a text called the ‘Dated Creed’ that said the Son was ‘like the Father in all things’. The majority of bishops, however, rejected the Dated Creed as an innovation and condemned the Homoian bishops. After suspending the council, the Homoians introduced a new creedal statement called the Niké Formula. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It reaffirmed the Council of Sirmium's ban of οὐσία language and affirmed that ‘the Son is like the Father’, deleting the phrase ‘in all things’. The Council of Ariminum reconvened and adopted the Niké Formula plus an anathema against those who denied that </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the Son of God was not a creature like other creatures’. Hilary and other pro-Nicenes were outraged by the ‘deception of Ariminum’. For the final anathema, far from affirming the divinity of the Son, implicitly sanctioned calling the Son a creature so long as he was understood to be ‘a creature unlike other creatures’. In the east the Council  <b class="calibre3">(p. 114) </b>of Seleucia replaced the Dated Creed with the Niké Formula on 1 January 360. Later in 360 </p>
<p class="calibre1">a second Council of Constantinople comprised of Homoian bishops from the east and west Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> adopted the Niké Formula as the official creed of the empire thus rendering Nicaea null and void. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The effect of the councils was to galvanize the pro-Nicenes and Homoiousians ultimately leading to their alliance. Although Basil of Ancyra had signed the Dated Creed, he added the qualification that the description of Father and Son as ‘like’ denotes the likeness of essence expressed by ὁμοιούσιος. He and others were conscious of the need to counter the subordinationism implicit in the Homoian Creed. In 359, when Athanasius published <i class="calibre4">On the Councils of Ariminum and Seleucia</i>, he realized that even those who were troubled by ὁμοούσιος but nevertheless subscribed to Nicaea's anathemas against Arian subordinationism were ‘brothers who mean what we mean but dispute only about a word’ (Behr 2004: 95). Although Athanasius himself had originally been uneasy about the term ὁμοούσιος and preferred to speak of the Son as ‘like’ the Father, he argued in  <i class="calibre4">De Decretis</i> (356) that the consubstantiality of the Son and Father was necessary if the Son is fully divine (Anatolios 1998: 87–9). In the West, after Constantinople (360), Hilary returned from his exile in the east where he had developed a friendship with Basil of Ancyra and gained greater insight into the Homoian theology. Hilary and Eusebius of Vercelli adopted the strategy of focusing on the Son's generation. The biblical language of begetting (Jn 1:18) necessarily implies that the Son is from the being of the Father. Since all offspring bear the same nature as their progenitor, the Son who is begotten from the Father is necessarily consubstantial with the Father. Marius Victorinus rejected the term ὁμοιούσιος arguing that a child does not have a  <i class="calibre4">similar</i> nature to that of her parents but the  <i class="calibre4">same</i> nature. It was acceptable to speak of the Son as having likeness ( <i class="calibre4">similitudo</i>) with the Father so long as the likeness was of ‘True God from True God’. Yet the unity of God, Hilary argued, did not imply singularity; God is One but not alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 362, Athanasius upon his return from exile called a synod in Alexandria that issued the <i class="calibre4">Epistola Catholica</i> that reaffirmed Nicaea and offered pardon to those bishops who signed the compromise creeds at Seleucia and Ariminum because they were deceived by the intentionally opaque language but who now had ‘come to their senses’. He also issued the <i class="calibre4">Tome to the Antiochenes</i> that sought rapprochement with the disciples of Eustathius and Meletius of Antioch by repudiating the modalist teachings of Marcellus and Photinus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Athanasius’ goal was to make clear that ὁμοούσιος affirmed the Son's full share in the Father's divine nature without denying the distinction between Father and Son. With the death of Athanasius in May 373, the task of forging an alliance between pro-Nicenes and Homoiousians shifted from Alexandria to Cappadocia. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Phase 5:</b> <b class="calibre3">Endgame: The Eunomians vs. the Cappadocians</b> Although more radical than the Eusebians and the Homoians, Aetius and his disciple Eunomius led a third generation of anti-Nicenes called by scholars ‘Neo-Arians’, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Anomoians’, ‘Heterousians’, or simply ‘Eunomians’. Trained in rhetoric and Aristotelian <b class="calibre3">(p. 115) </b>philosophy in Alexandria, Aetius in  <i class="calibre4">Syntagmation</i> rebutted Athanasius’ defence of ὁμοούσιος. Based on a theory of language derived from Plato's  <i class="calibre4">Cratylus</i>, he argued that, since terms reveal the essence of a thing, God's essence is knowable. Against ὁμοούσιος, Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> Aetius and Eunomius contended that God's essence (οσία) is ‘unbegotten’ or </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘ingenerate’ (ἁγέννητος) while the Son is ‘begotten’ (γέννητος). Since the essence of God is ‘unbegotten’, the Only-Begotten Son of the Father is, by definition, not ὁμοούσιος with the Father. The pro-Nicene rebuttal came from the Cappadocian bishops: Basil of Caesarea, his brother Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus. In  <i class="calibre4">Contra Eunomium</i> (364), Basil countered that concepts (ἐπίνοια) about God arise from the process of reflection whereby the mind analyses impressions of God from Scripture. Theology, therefore, does not give immediate knowledge of the divine essence but is a reflection upon the manner in which God revealed himself through the divine activities (ἐνέργεια). Reflection on the nature of God (θεολογία) centres upon the divine activities or economy described in Scripture (οἰκονομία). Nazianzen argues that the divine essence is wholly beyond human understanding and speech, ‘to speak of God is not possible but to know God is even less than possible’ ( <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 28.4). Since theological inferences are drawn from the divine activities in the sensible, corporeal realm, our concepts and language about God arise from impressions in the material world. However, because God is incorporeal, our corporeal speech cannot properly represent God's essence. Even negative theology, Nazianzen says, does not give knowledge of God. Saying what something  <i class="calibre4">is not</i> does not give knowledge of the essence; it does not tell what God  <i class="calibre4">is</i>. ‘Unbegotten’, as ‘immutable’, ‘eternal’, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘holy’, are only properties of God's nature and not the essence itself. The Cappadocians appealed to a doctrine of divine simplicity to defend God's unknowability. Since God is immaterial, he is also simple and so cannot be known by being broken down into constituent elements. Thus the doctrine of divine simplicity comes to set conditions for speech about God (Ayres 2004: 287). Since God is infinite mystery, no single term sums up all that God is. By refuting Eunomius’ claim to define the essence of God, the Cappadocians undercut the Eunomian claim that Father and Son are essentially different and so not ὁμοούσιος. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cappadocians ultimately cemented the alliance of the pro-Nicenes and Homoiousians against Homoians and Eunomians by defending the essential unity of Father, Son, and Spirit while at the same time explaining how, contra the Sabellians, they remain distinct even in their unity. Although the essence of God was unnamable, one could still argue from Scripture that the persons were consubstantial based on their power (δύναμις) revealed in their ἐνέργεια. Eunomius understood God's creative power as analogous to the imperial authority (ἐξουσία μόνη δημιουργει̑ν) to command his minister to make what he willed. The Son is the Father's perfect minister (ὑπουργός) carrying out the Father's will (Barnes 2001: 212). This view is supported by Jesus’ admission ‘The Son can do nothing apart from the Father’ (Jn 5:19). But drawing on 1 Cor. 1:24, ‘Christ [is] the wisdom and power of God’, Nyssen counters that the Father and Son do not have different powers but one and the same power. Logos is the power of God to create, sustain, and foresee the future ( <i class="calibre4">Catechetical Oration</i> 5). Drawing on Plato ( <i class="calibre4">Republic</i> 509B) and Plotinus (V.1.6), Nyssen appealed to the Platonist view that God out of his goodness  <b class="calibre3">(p. 116) </b>is naturally generative. The Father's generative power that begets the Son is the same power by which the Son creates the world (Barnes 2001: 244–5). Yet, unlike the Platonists, Nyssen argues that the Son is not inferior to the Father who is the source of his being and power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Father's goodness and power are, Nyssen and Eunomius agreed, perfect and ab</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> solute; therefore, they are unbounded and infinite. Since the Son and Spirit are consubstantial with the Father, they naturally possess the Father's infinite goodness and power. Since their natural goodness and power are infinite, they are necessarily equal to the Father's; for there is no deficiency or limit to their infinite power that would make the Son and Spirit inferior to the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i> I.77). Thus the Son and Spirit are equal in divinity with the Father and so cannot be viewed as ontologically inferior to the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cappadocians described the Father, Son, and Spirit's common nature and power manifest in the divine economy as a unity of operations (Basil,  <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 8.19–21; Nazianzen,  <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 30.11). All things issue from the will of the Father, are actualized by the Son, and brought to perfection by the Spirit (Basil,  <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 16.38). As at Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan, all three persons are simultaneously present and active together in every divine work. At the same time that the Cappadocians affirmed the unity of Father, Son, and Spirit, they avoided the charge of modalism that accompanied ὁμοούσιος </p>
<p class="calibre1">by preserving clear distinctions between the persons. Each person, or ὑπόστασις, is eternal, discrete, and subsistent. Each is a mode of God's being distinguished from each other by its origin. The Father is ingenerate, the Son begotten, the Spirit spirated. Contra Eunomius, ‘ingenerate’ and ‘begotten’ do not denote different essences but are merely different  <i class="calibre4">modes</i> of God's being, describing relationship (σχέσις) between the persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Modes of God's being’ differs significantly from Sabellius’ ‘modes of God's self-revelation’. For the modalist, the persons are the way the one God reveals himself in history, but are not real and eternal distinctions within the Godhead. For the Cappadocian by contrast, the persons are real distinctions within God. God does not merely appear as three persons in the economy of salvation but is triune from eternity. Thus the Cappadocians developed an understanding of Nicaea that upheld the unity of God necessary for affirming the Son's full divinity and at the same time that affirmed the distinction between the persons which earlier critics perceived was absent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the autumn of 379, Meletius of Antioch called a council at Antioch to solidify the pro-Nicene alliance. The council appointed Gregory of Nazianzus Nicene Bishop of Constantinople. In July and August 380 at the Church of the Resurrection in Constantinople, Nazianzen delivered his famous five  <i class="calibre4">Theological Orations</i> (Orations 27–31) that attacked the theology of the rival Homoian bishop of Constantinople, Demophilus, as well as the Eunomians, and the Pneumatomachians led by Eustathius of Sebaste. In November 380, Demophilus left Constantinople rather than submit to Theodosius’ edict of January 380 </p>
<p class="calibre1">making Nicaea the faith of the empire and banning Arians, Eunomians, and Photinians. In May 381, Theodotius summoned the Council of Constantinople. Meletius of Antioch chaired the council until he died and was replaced by Gregory of Nazianzus. The canons of the Council of Constantinople reaffirmed the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 117) </b>Nicene Creed to which it added an affirmation of the divinity of the Spirit as the one who ‘proceeds from the Father’ and who is worshipped together with the Father and the Son. With the formula that God is one Being (οὐσία) in three persons (ὑπόστασεις), it anathematized the Eunomians, Arians (i.e. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">Exegesis</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Christian culture that emerged at the end of the fourth century was based upon a certain approach to reading scripture that developed from debates surrounding Nicaea about biblical descriptions of the Son and his relationship with the Father (Young 1997: 298). Central to Arius’ as well as to the Homoian and Eunomian view of Christ as a creature was the insistence that, while God is immutable, the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> had to be mutable in order to enter into a changeable body, suffer, and die on the cross. They found support for this view in passages that spoke of Christ's growing in wisdom (Lk. 2:40), confessing ignorance of the future (Mk 13:23), and experiencing suffering. The cornerstone proof-text, however, was Prov. 8:22 in which Wisdom, i.e. the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>, says, ‘The Lord created me at the beginning of his ways for his works’. The obvious meaning was that Christ was a creature, created by the Father to be his agent of creation. Pro-Nicenes countered that these passages were fundamentally misinterpreted and could rightly be understood by employing a method of interpretation that we call partitive exegesis. The Incarnation, Gregory of Nazianzus argued, was the intermingling of the immutable, divine nature proper to the eternal  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> with a mutable and passible human nature ( <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 30.3). Therefore, in reading Scripture one must distinguish the lofty expressions that are attributable to Christ's divinity from the lowly descriptions that must be ascribed to Christ's humanity ( <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 30.1). Thus descriptions of Christ's growth, ignorance, and suffering were attributes of Christ in his humanity and not proper to the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> in his immutable divinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently, Nazianzen reasoned, the Eunomians could not infer from these passages that the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> was subject to change and therefore was a creature rather than true God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazianzen used partitive exegesis to explain that Prov. 8:22 was prophetic, referring to Wisdom's earthly generation in the Incarnation. By contrast, when Wisdom later says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills I was begotten’ (Prov. 8:25), it refers to the Son's ‘primal and less comprehensible’ generation from the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 30.2). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 118) 3. </b> <b class="calibre3">Subordinationism: The Legacy of Origen</b> Although conflict between pro-Nicenes and anti-Nicenes has been characterized as a debate about the divinity of the Son, recent work on the fourth century has argued that the real debate was not whether the Son was divine but whether he was true God, equal in divinity to the Father. Or was he merely a divine creature inferior to the Father? This division of opinion is traceable to Origen, who influenced bishops on both sides of the controversy. Commenting on Jn 1:1–2, ‘the Word was with God and the Word was God’, Origen Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> identified ὁ Θεός as the Father who is true God, while the Word is θεός or divine but not true God. Thus, Origen and his Eusebian descendents conclude that the Son was unequal to the Father in divinity. They found further in Jesus’ words, ‘The Father is greater than I’, and his rhetorical question to the lawyer, ‘Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone’. At the same time that Origen portrayed the Son as inferior to the Father, he insisted that the Son as the Wisdom of the wise Father is intrinsic to the being of the Father. Since the omniscient Father is never lacking wisdom, the Son, as the Father's wisdom, is eternally begotten by the Father. This was precisely Alexander's argument in 320. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the coherence of Origen's view is left unresolved; can the Son be intrinsic to the being of the Father and thus coeternal with the Father but not be true God, equal to the Father in divinity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Arius, that the Father is ‘greater than the Son’ is evident in the unique character of the Father's οὐσία or being. The Father alone is self-subsistent, unbegotten, and therefore absolutely free to will and do what he wills (R. Williams 1987: 98). By contrast, the Son is begotten from the Father's will. Therefore, the Son is neither self-subsistent nor free in his will. Rather, his existence and his will are dependent upon and derived from the Father. Therefore, Arius and the Eusebians used Paul's description of Christ as ‘the image of the invisible God’ (Col. 1:15) to distinguish the Son, who is the reflection of the perfect archetype, from the Father, who is the archetype. From the perspective of Arius and the Eusebians, image Christology explained how the Son could act as mediator between God and creation by revealing the Father but at the same time avoided the Sabellian error of conflating Father and Son into one being. For an image is not the same thing as the archetype, but a separate and discrete thing. Moreover since the Son was begotten and so was not coeternal with the Father, the Son was, as Arius declared in his letter to Alexander, ‘a perfect creature, yet not among the creatures, a begotten thing, yet not as one among begotten things’ (R. Williams 1987: 104). This view was repeated in the Dedication Creed of 341 and the anathema of Ariminum of 359 (D. H. Williams 1995: 34). Arius and Homoians did speak of the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> as ‘God’ but ‘God’ did not denote the Son's nature. Rather it was an honorific title as when Ps. 131:6 says of human beings, ‘You are gods and all of you are sons of the Most High’. Thus Christ is not properly God, but is called God because he mirrors the Father's will (Hilary,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> IV.3 and VI.18). Because for Arius Christ is God, not  <b class="calibre3">(p. 119) </b>by nature, but by being the reflection of the Father who alone is true God, Christ is ontologically subordinate to the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the perspective of pro-Nicene bishops, such as Hilary of Poitiers, there is an absolute dividing line between creatures and the eternal, divine Creator. The Son must fall on one side or the other of that divide. If Christ is God, he is true God. He cannot be God but not true God any more than fire can be fire but not true fire (Hilary,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V. </p>
<p class="calibre1">14). Therefore, Origen's distinction between the Father who is true God and the Son who was divine but not true God was incoherent to the pro-Nicenes. Even a perfect and unique creature, like Arius’ Christ, is just a creature, not God. Consequently, the Eusebians and Homoians could not make the Son ontologically subordinate to the Father and still worship him as God. If, on the other hand, the Son is God he must be equal in divinity to the Father and so must be one with the Father in his divine nature (ὁμοούσιος). In the Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> pro-Nicene grammar, the dividing line between Creator and creature was whether one possessed existence by nature or by participation. Since creatures are made from nothing, they do not possess life in themselves but must gain it by participating in the source of life, God. However, God, the great I Am, is being itself. Existence is inherent to God's nature. Because the Son is ὁμοούσιος with the Father, existence, as well as wisdom, goodness, and power, are proper to his nature and not derived through participation in some other nature (Nyssen,  <i class="calibre4">Catechetical Oration</i> 1). Humanity becomes divine and attains eternal life by adoption and participation in the divine nature through the Holy Spirit. The Son is God, not by adoption or participation, but by nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were two chief reasons for the pro-Nicenes’ uncompromising insistence upon the ontological unity and equality of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. First was the apostolic witness to Christ's divinity expressed in Jesus’ words, ‘I and the Father are one’ (Jn 10:30) and ‘He who has seen me has seen the Father—I am in the Father and the Father [is] in me’ (Jn 14:9–10). One key text for supporting the equality of Father and Son was the Christ Hymn (Phil. 2:6–11). For example, Marius Victorinus maintained that ‘the form of God’ denotes the Son's divine nature and power. When Paul says that Christ ‘did not count equality with God a thing to be held onto’ he implies that the Son is equal to the Father. The only way the Son can be equal to the Father, Victorinus concluded, is if the Son is ὁμοούσιος with the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Against the Arians</i> IA.9). Second, Christ's divinity was necessary for the restoration of the  <i class="calibre4">imago Dei</i> and for humanity's participation in the saving process of divinization or deification (θέωσις). As Athanasius succinctly put it, ‘God became man that man might become god-like’, and so gave us a share in his incorruption and immortality that our fall toward non-existence might be arrested ( <i class="calibre4">On the Incarnation</i> 54.3). In the Incarnation, Christ leavens the lump of human nature with his divinity that humanity might participate in Christ's divine nature so that the image of God may be restored and humanity come to see and desire God (Nyssen,  <i class="calibre4">Catechetical Oration</i> 5). Hilary describes the causal relation between the full divinity of the Word and the divinization of humanity commenting on Col. 2:10, ‘As the fullness of the Godhead is in [Jesus], so we are made full in him … for all who are regenerated through hope … abide even now in the body of Christ’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> IX.8). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 120) </b>One challenge facing the pro-Nicenes was explaining Jesus’ claim ‘The Father is greater than I’ without concluding that the Son is ontologically inferior to the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nazianzen grounds both the Father's superiority and the ontological equality of the persons in his account of the monarchy of the Father. Nazianzen explains that the Father is </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘primarily God’ because he is the source and cause of the Son and Spirit who derive their divinity from their timeless generation or procession from the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 25.15–18; Beeley 2008: 204). Because Father and Son are consubstantial (ὁμοούσιος), they share the same indivisible, and therefore equal, divinity derived from the Father. Nazianzen, nevertheless, interprets Jesus’ claim ‘The Father is greater than I’ (Jn 14:28) not in economic term as the result of his ‘emptying’ himself in the Incarnation, but in terms of the Father's generation of the Son. The Father is greater than the Son and Spirit by virtue of being the source of the Trinity (Beeley 2008: 206). The Father as first principle is the begetter of the Son and emitter of the Spirit. The relationship of these subsistent modes Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> of God's being is preserved as a unity because of the eternal generation and procession of Son and Spirit from the Father and their eternal return to the Father from whom their divinity is derived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">4. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Holy Spirit</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For the better part of the fourth century, the Holy Spirit was a peripheral issue. Nicaea's inclusion of the phrase ‘And [I believe] in the Holy Spirit’ without commenting on the content of the belief indicates that the Spirit was not the epicentre of the controversy. Nevertheless, the pro-Nicenes, such as Athanasius and Hilary, were explicit in affirming the divinity of the Spirit. Although Arius’ argument for the uniqueness of the Father's οὐσία implied that the Spirit, like the Son, was not the Father's ontological equal, the real dispute was between pro-Nicenes and a faction of Homoiousians called Pneumatomachians (‘Spirit-fighters’) who were followers of Macedonius of Constantinople. Macedonius was a Homoiousian who affirmed the divinity of the Son but denied the divinity of the Spirit. The Spirit, according to the Pneumatomachians, was the divine ἐνέργεια of the Father but was not God (Nazianzen,  <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 31.5). Their primary reason was Scripture's silence on the point. The rebuttal to the Pneumatomachians came in 375 with Basil's publication of  <i class="calibre4">On</i> <i class="calibre4">the Holy Spirit</i> which was the first treatise devoted entirely to the Spirit. Although the object of the treatise was to argue for the Spirit's divinity, Basil did not speak of the Spirit as ὁμοούσιος with the Father and Son. In 376, the Council of Iconium affirmed the Spirit's divinity based on Basil's argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defence of the Spirit's divinity hinged upon the Spirit's place in the practice of worship. Basil's disagreement with Aetius over the Spirit centred on the description of the Spirit in the doxology. Based on his theory of language, Aetius maintained ‘the relationship between prepositions indicates a relationship between natures’ and so concluded that in the traditional doxology, ‘Glory to the Father  <i class="calibre4">through</i> the Son  <i class="calibre4">in</i> the Holy Spirit’, the prepositions indicate the essential difference between Father, Son, and Spirit  <b class="calibre3">(p. 121)</b> ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 2.4). The Son is the instrument through whom glory is given and the Spirit is the ‘place’ or ‘time’ in which glory is given. After refuting Aetius’ theory of prepositions by demonstrating that Scripture (e.g. Rom. 11:36) applies multiple prepositions to each person, Basil argues for another new form of the doxology, ‘Glory to the Father  <i class="calibre4">with</i> the Son,  <i class="calibre4">together with</i> the Holy Spirit’, that affirms the Spirit's equality with the Father and Son in power and dignity ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit, </i> 5.7–12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pro-Nicenes’ argument for the Spirit's ontological equality with the Father and Son focused on the Spirit's renewing and divinizing work in baptism. Following the principle that God cannot be known or confessed by sinful humanity unless he reveals himself, Athanasius claimed that the Spirit cannot mediate the knowledge of God unless the Spirit is itself divine ( <i class="calibre4">To Serapion</i> I.25). By participating in the Spirit, the Christian participates in the Son and through the Son in the Father. Thus through the Spirit, the Christian participates in the life of the Triune God and so derives eternal life from God (Anatolios 1998: 115). This participation in the life of God is possible because the Spirit confers the gift of Page 12 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Fourth-Century Fathers</b> faith by which we may confess Christ in baptism. Appealing to both the baptismal formula from Matt. 28:19 and to the Christian experience of the Holy Spirit in baptism, Hilary said the Spirit is ‘the Gift who gives us perfect hope’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> II.1 and II.3). The Spirit is the gift of the Father because the Spirit is sent to infuse us with the divine light illuminating the soul and bringing knowledge of God; ‘Unless through faith one has appropriated the gift of the Spirit, the soul will have the innate faculty of apprehending God, but be destitute of the light of knowledge’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> II.35). Commenting on Ps. 36:9, ‘In your light shall we see light’, Nazianzen taught that the Spirit is the light by which we are able to see the light of the Father revealed in the Son who is ‘the true light’ ( <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 31.3). Christians gain the saving and sanctifying knowledge of God by ascending to the Father through his image revealed in the Son whom we behold through the light of the Spirit (Basil,  <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 18.47). Without the light of the Spirit, Marius Victorinus said, the Son appears as merely a man and his glory remains hidden behind the veil of flesh. Only when the Spirit speaks to our spirit do we see the form of God at work in the form of a servant ( <i class="calibre4">Contra Arianos</i> IA.12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Church is able to participate in the saving work of Christ through the light of the Spirit. The Spirit renews the image of God in the believer by revealing the glory of the Son who is the image of the invisible God. When through the illumination of the Spirit ‘we fix our eyes upon the beauty of the image of the invisible God … [we] are led through the image up to the indescribable beauty of its source [i.e. the Father]’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 18.47). This vision of the beauty of God arouses a holy desire for God such that ‘Spirit-filled souls … finally become spiritual themselves and their grace is sent forth to others’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 9.23). The believer becomes conformed to the holiness and spiritual nature of the God whose Spirit dwells within his people individually and corporately. Even as humanity is made holy by participating in the divine nature that is holy, so too humanity attains immortality by participating in God's immortal nature. Since the Spirit ‘proceeds from the mouth of the Father’ and is consubstantial with the Father (Nazianzen,  <i class="calibre4">Orations</i> 41.12), the Spirit possesses the ‘essence of life’ proper to the Father's divine nature whereby the Spirit is able to ‘redeem our life from corruption [and] </p>
<p class="calibre1">give us  <b class="calibre3">(p. 122) </b>the power to be renewed’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> 12.28). The Spirit is, as the Council of Constantinople (381) declared, ‘the giver of life’ because through the divine Spirit the Church is able to attain eternal life from the nature of the Triune God. By participating in the life of God who is life itself, humanity that is by nature mortal and corruptible puts on the immortality and incorruptibility of divine nature. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article offers a positive exposition of Augustine's mature Trinitarian theology that builds on the best of recent scholarship. It describes the Trinitarian theology of Augustine as being structured around the Father's begetting of the Word that breathes forth Love. It identifies the roots of Augustine's theology in the Latin anti-modalist tradition and in his appreciation of God's transcendent simplicity. It considers Augustine's emphasis on the salvific missions as drawing us into the mystery of the divine processions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE account given of Augustine in this chapter will not accord with that still to be found in many textbooks. Those accounts frequently treat Augustine as the paradigm and origin of a distinct western tradition, over-emphasizing the unity of God, claiming to know far too much about God's inner life, forgetting that in all things the Father works through Son and (or ‘in’) Spirit, and separating reflection on the Trinity from reflection on the God who is revealed in Christ's ministry, death, and resurrection. One of the key sources for this reading in the twentieth century was the nineteenth-century French Jesuit scholar Theodore de Régnon. Although de Régnon's purpose in identifying different ‘Greek’ and </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Latin’ paradigms of Trinitarian theology was to argue for the necessity of both, later scholars tended to take this division as an opposition, and eventually many identified the Latin model as deficient. More recent scholarship has questioned the adequacy of the model as such, and argued that Augustine himself has been grossly misrepresented by it (Barnes 1995). In this chapter I will make no attempt to discuss and refute aspects of this model directly (indeed, it has received no scholarly defence for some decades); instead, I offer a positive exposition of Augustine's mature Trinitarian theology that builds on the best of recent scholarship. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From eternity God speaks his Word, the Word in whom he determines all that will be (for the significance of the Father's role in Augustine's theology see Ayres 2010: ch. 7; and Dunham 2007). This Word is also Wisdom (‘ordering all things well’ as we find at Wisd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8:1) and Image; as ‘God from God’ the Word is a perfect image of the Father's nature. To help us understand what it means to speak of God's Word Augustine draws an analogy with an artist who plans in her mind a work of art before bringing it into being externally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We might say she plans through a creative act of developing a knowing of what she wishes to create, or we might say that she plans by bringing to life the skill she has in her <b class="calibre3">(p. 124) </b>mind. Following this analogy, the Word or Wisdom of God is the Father's ‘creative knowledge or skill’ or  <i class="calibre4">ars</i>. The Latin term  <i class="calibre4">ars</i> gives rise to the modern English ‘art’, but it has a range of senses that are frequently lost in English. In Latin the term can describe the learned skill of an artist, the set of principles that will lead to the product of her skill exhibiting form and beauty. But, Augustine tells us, the Father's Wisdom or Word is an eternal, living, and active creative knowledge ( <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the Gospel of John</i> 1–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine also offers the analogy of what he terms the ‘interior word’ conceived in the mind of a person thinking and desiring. Augustine speaks not just of any conception or plan present in the mind, but of a ‘word’ conceived in truth and conceived through rightly ordered love. Such a word—at one point he gives the example of ‘God’—is a ‘word’ we speak internally because of and for the increase of love, and it is a ‘word’ which orients us to that which is true. It is, as Augustine writes, ‘a true Son of the heart’ ( <i class="calibre4">Tractates on</i> <i class="calibre4">the Gospel of John</i> 1.9). When we find Augustine also emphasizing that the Father speaks his Word in order to reveal himself, we see Augustine emphasizing that the Father's self-revelation in the Word is necessarily a revelation of who he is (the Son is also Truth) and necessarily a revelation of the Father as a God of Love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Augustine God is both intelligible and revealed as mystery: intelligible, because the Father reveals himself in the Son and in the creation (which exists in the Word and thus reflects the Father's self-revelation); but mystery because God transcends all analogies we may offer as created beings and always eludes any final grasp of the intellect. The Father's ‘speaking’ of his Word is, for example, an eternal speaking unmarked by the temporality that accompanies ours, and the Father's Word exists eternally, distinct, but without dividing God into Gods, being all the fullness of what it is to be God. We can strain our minds toward such a reality but it cannot be finally grasped by us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second of the divine three is not only Word and Wisdom and Image, but also Son. The Father generates a Son who shares all that the Father is save being the Father. How should we understand the relationship between Father and Son? What does it mean to say that the Son is ‘generated’? Christians came to use this terminology because Jn 1:18 </p>
<p class="calibre1">speaks of the ‘only-begotten’, but its meaning is not obvious. Indeed, one problem for all Nicene theologians during the fourth century was to find a way of distinguishing the Father's act of generation from all acts of creating (because then the Son would not be truly God) and from all acts that give rise to two beings who must be called two Gods (be</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">cause then the most fundamental confession of Jews and Christians, that God is one, would be compromised). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually Nicene theologians came to agree that this act of generation is unique: it fits into no category of generation that we know—however much we can make use of very distant likenesses in the created order. The scriptural language of ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ enables us to recognize the continuity of nature that must obtain between the one who generates and the one who is generated (just as it does between human fathers and children). The same language suggests the eternity of Father and Son (if ‘Father’ may always be predicated of God then the Son must always have been there). The language of Word and Wisdom enables us to push a little further. But all Nicenes are also certain that one of our key confessions about this unique generation is that while it results in a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 125) </b>distinction (Father and Son are distinct and not identical), there is no division of the divine (identifying Father and Son does not lead to the conclusion that now we have two divine beings). Whatever analogy we use, then, at some point we come up against the sheer incomprehensibility of the act for those of us who are created. Augustine's contribution to this tradition is to reflect on how the paradox of distinction without division presents itself to thought when we consider what it means for the Father to generate a Son who shares all that the Father is within the divine simplicity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Through Faith toward Understanding</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">But before we press further into this mystery we must take a few steps back and reflect on Augustine's understanding of the theological task, specifically on the distinction between believing and moving toward understanding. Augustine is convinced that Christian attempts to understand scriptural discussion of God are founded in a rightly formed faith</p>
<p class="calibre1">—a knowledge and acceptance of Scriptural imagery, language, and logic. One of the clearest examples is to be seen in his favourite style of Trinitarian summary: although indeed the Father has begotten the Son, and therefore he who is the Father is not the Son; and the Son is begotten by the Father, and therefore he who is the Son is not the Father; and the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son, but only the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. ( <i class="calibre4">The Trinity</i> 1.4.7) This sparse language comes to Augustine from the Latin anti-Monarchian tradition. The Monarchians, flourishing during the early third century, argued that Son and Spirit are no more than names for the Father at work in the created order. Latin Trinitarian theology came into its own against this tradition, with figures such as Tertullian ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.160–220) and Novatian ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.200–58). Whereas their opponents argued that Jn 14:10 (‘I am in the Father, and the Father is in me’) implied that Father and Son were the same one divine reality, Tertullian and Novatian argued that the very grammar of Scripture here demands that for one to be ‘in’ another, one is not the other. Augustine drew extensively on this tradition to articulate his summary statements of Trinitarian belief, finding in this sparse language careful attention to the foundational Scriptural logic of Trinitarian belief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We advance toward understanding when we gradually grow in our skill at imagining how these words may be understood of a reality which is unmarked by space, time, and the divisions or imperfections of the created order. This is for Augustine partly a discipline of the mind in which we learn to remove from our interpretation of Scripture's logic any temporal or material qualifications, and it is a search for correspondences between Scripture's language and metaphors and the divine realities signified by that language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An example of the former is given below in discussion of generation without division; for an example of the latter see sermons 23 and 53, which were preached on consecutive days, where God's ‘hands’ and ‘face’ are God's ‘power’ and ‘knowledge’ (Augustine 1990b: 56–65 and 1991: 66–75). These correspondences are often inherited by Augustine from earlier tradition, and where they are new he is  <b class="calibre3">(p. 126) </b>clear that they must follow clues within the text itself. Augustine's account is also shaped by his insistence that the ‘missions’ of Son and Spirit are intended to reveal their eternal ‘processions’ from the Father (Ayres 2010: ch. 7; Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">The Trinity</i> 4.20.27–21.32). We have already seen Augustine reach out through deduction and a loose form of analogy toward understanding, and his sermons are peppered with passages in a similar style (Cavadini 2004). Throughout this chapter we turn again and again to texts where he attempts to push as far as the human intellect is able to reach, even if it must fall back constantly confessing its inability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout our investigation, however, we must bear in mind that Augustine sees such an ascent of thought as fruitful only if it is founded in an ongoing reformation of desire and intellectual life shaped by the work of grace. Only through grace's education and drawing of the intellect and will are we drawn both to transcend the materiality of the fallen intellect and to accept and learn more of the mystery of the divine. This is always an education and a drawing that happens through our incorporation (by the Spirit) into the body of Christ. Christ's human words draw us into the mystery of his divine and transformative presence. In this sense, although Augustine celebrates the gifts of the intellect in those who have them, the smartest in the body of Christ must always learn from the one who is most humble before the divine mystery and most sincerely confesses his or her need for divine aid. In this sense theological thinking begins in the mystery of dying and rising with and in Christ. There is no salvation by Ph.D. alone (and this is one of the places where one sees how closely Augustine relates his account of the eternal processions of Son and Spirit to the work of redemption; see Ayres 2010: ch. 7; Gioia 2008). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Generation and Simplicity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to follow Augustine's reflections on how we can understand the Father generating a Son in the context of the divine simplicity, we need, first, to think about how Augustine understands the divine as such. For the mature Augustine there is only one truly simple being, God: all that we know in the created order is to some degree composite, composed of parts. Some things are composite in purely material senses, many are the subject of accidents. In its simplest usage an ‘accident’ is an attribute that is not essential to a being: a car may be purple or orange; a person may be wise or foolish. Accidents thus involve distinguishing between the essence of a thing and that which qualifies it (Augustine knows that some ancient philosophers argued for a category of accidents that were Page 4 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">inseparable, but he dismisses the idea that we could make use of such an idea in the case of God). For Augustine, however, God cannot be conceived in such terms because God is the fullness and source of all such qualities—God is Wisdom, and Beauty and Justice and Goodness itself. Indeed, in Trinitarian discussions, one of Augustine's favourite ways of describing God's simplicity is just to say that God ‘is’ what God is said to ‘have’: when we say that God lives or is good we should understand that as meaning that God is life itself or goodness itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 127) </b>Divine simplicity is, thus, not only a doctrine about God, it is also a doctrine about the nature of the created order and its relationship to God. Augustine sees the created order as constantly sustained by Word and Spirit, the divine fullness played out for us through the changeable beauties of this world. For all in the created order to be informed by the same dependable perfect source, God must be this unique transcendent fullness, a unity which precedes all number. It makes no sense to speak of God, this transcendent fullness, as changing, as potentially losing that status, or in any sense needing to achieve it (Acts 17:24–5). But we should not assume that Augustine envisages God's immutability as simply the opposite to the dynamism and action that we often see as the attributes of change. Of the nine categories that Aristotle discusses, Augustine states that action is the only one that can without qualification be applied to God. At the same time, Augustine takes from Ps. 121:4 the term  <i class="calibre4">idipsum</i>—the identical or the selfsame—to describe God (Ayres 2010: ch. 8; Marion 2008; Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">Sermons</i> 7.7), but he is clear that for God to be this is for God actively to remain so from eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we ask about Augustine's Scriptural evidence for this account we must point not only to texts which speak directly of God's unchangeability (Mal. 3:6, James 1:17) but also to texts which speak of God creating through the Word who is immediately present in all things (Jn 1:3–4, 10; Wisd. 7:24, 27), of the creation as revealing the glory of God (Ps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">19:1; 104:24), of the existence of all in God (Acts 17:28; 1 Cor. 6:8; Wisd. 11:21; Isa. 6:3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scriptural material is certainly here drawn together by a set of themes adapted from earlier Christian thinkers and non-Christian Platonists, but one can also say that resonances within and between a host of Scriptural texts are drawn out and highlighted through careful adaptation of those themes to Christian ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now that we have seen something of what Augustine means by the expression ‘God is what God is said to have’, we can return to how Augustine articulates the mystery of the Father generating the Son without division. We must, for Augustine, speak of the Father as generating another, a Son who is his Word and Wisdom, because Scripture demands it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, yet, if the Son possesses all that it is to be God, then the Son, like the Father, must be the one undivided source of all and there seems to have been no division of that one source. Thus, if we try to speak of the Father generating one who shares all that the Father is then we are drawn inevitably back to confessing the inescapable unity of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus we can speak of generation, but we must also speak of that which generates being one with the one who generates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the conditions of created existence this can only seem a paradox. Seeing that it might logically be so under the conditions of divine simplicity does not enable us to comprehend God's existence, but it does help to refine our sense of what may and may not be said about God and the ways in which God's existence transcends our created understanding. To undertake such a task is to move our hearts, minds, and imaginations through the creation toward the Creator. Through this discussion of the Son's generation Augustine develops an argument that is uniquely his, and yet he does so at the service of highly traditional Nicene language—the Son is eternally God from God. This is a combination we shall see again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 128) ‘Only what he sees the Father doing … ’</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine's mature exegeses of Jn 5:19 (‘The Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing … ’) offers us an excellent point of departure for seeing in more positive terms how Augustine thinks we can speak of the relationships between Father and Son. Naturally enough, Augustine refuses the idea that the Son sees the Father performing an action and then copies it. Such an interpretation would not only import temporal and spatial differentiation into the relations between Father and Son, it would also contradict Jn 1:3 (‘All things came into being through him’). Augustine's solution is simple: In your flesh you hear in one place, you see in another; in your heart you hear there where you see. If the image [does] this, how much more powerfully [does] </p>
<p class="calibre1">he [do it] whose image this is? Therefore the Son both hears and the Son sees; and the Son is the very seeing and hearing. And for him hearing is the same as being, and for him seeing is the same as being. But for you seeing is not the same as being, because even if you should lose your sight, you can still be, and if you should lose your hearing, you can still be. ( <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the Gospel of John</i> 18.10) The Son's being is identical with his seeing of the Father, and the Father is identical with his showing to the Son. In the 23rd of his tractates on John Augustine emphasizes, again, the failure of any bodily analogy for speaking or showing: ‘simplicity is there. The Father shows the Son what he is doing and by showing begets the Son’ ( <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the Gospel</i> <i class="calibre4">of John</i> 23.9). This last sentence is an important one: the Son is identical with his seeing of the Father, but Augustine does not envisage a sequence in which the Son is generated from the Father and then ‘sees’: the Son's being ‘shown’ is the same as his being generated, and the Son's seeing is his being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine's exegesis here fleshes out more positively how he sees Father and Son as each simple, as each act, and how he envisages a Trinitarian order grounded in the Father's eternal act. Note also that this more positive picture enables Augustine to be attentive to the text of Scripture in his account of the relations between Father and Son, but it also allows him to enter more deeply into the mystery of Scripture using human terms to speak of God's unique mode of existence. And thus we see here something of the movement from faith to understanding, but a movement always also into Scripture's depths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Holy Spirit</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For Augustine Scripture and the inherited faith of the Church tells us that the Trinity consists of Father, Son, and Spirit. Father and Son are each named in many unique ways that provide us with obvious points of reference when we try to understand their eternal characteristics and mutual relationships. In the case of the Spirit, Scripture tells us much <b class="calibre3">(p. 129) </b>about the activities and roles of the Spirit in the life of Christ and the Church, but does not give us anything like the set of unique titles we have for Father and Son. The Spirit is, most importantly, named as the Holy Spirit, but this is a combination of terms that surely must also be true of Father and Son? However, Augustine's mature pneumatology takes the character of Scripture's naming of the Spirit not as a failing for which later doctrinal development must make up, but as an invitation to the Christian heart and mind, an invitation to see why the Spirit is so named, an invitation to come slowly to understand the heart of the Christian life and the nature of God (for Augustine's mature pneumatology see Ayres 2010: ch. 9; Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the First Epistle of John</i> 6.9–</p>
<p class="calibre1">14; and  <i class="calibre4">The Trinity</i> 15.17.27–19.37). </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the foundations of Augustine's account lies Rom. 5:5: ‘the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us’. Augustine reads this verse as asserting that the Spirit gives us love, but the Spirit gives us the Spirit and thus the love that we receive  <i class="calibre4">is</i> the Spirit. This love is also the Father's Gift (Acts 8:17–20). Indeed, ‘Gift’ is for Augustine the one unique title accorded the Spirit but, as he says, the Spirit is named Gift because the Spirit is love. The Spirit may even be understood as eternally gift, as a love eternally waiting to be given. Augustine is also especially attentive to the New Testament's naming of the Spirit as the Spirit ‘of’ the Father, of truth, of God, of Christ (e.g. Rom. 8; Gal. 4:6; Jn 15:26). The Spirit is ‘of’ both Father and Son and thus is necessarily ‘something common’. Scripture, then, names the Holy Spirit in an allusive manner so that we will be drawn slowly to recognize, first, that the Spirit is not simply a third  <i class="calibre4">beside</i> Father and Son, but one who is the Spirit  <i class="calibre4">of</i> both. Second, we are drawn to recognize that the Spirit who is given and who is the heart of the Christian life is the love who joins Father and Son—in receiving the Spirit we are thus drawn into the divine life itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We will, however, miss much if we stop here and do not explore how Augustine sees this Spirit as also fully possessed of and being all that it is to be God, fully an irreducible divine ‘person’. In his  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> Augustine writes: Nor because they give and he is given is he, therefore, less than they, for he is so given as the gift of God that he also gives himself as God. For it is impossible to say of Him that he is not a master of his own power, of whom it was said: ‘the Spirit breathes where he will’ … there is no subordination of the Gift and no domination of the givers, but the concord between the gift and the givers. ( <i class="calibre4">The Trinity</i> 15.19.36)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Alongside this bare but precise statement that the Spirit gives himself, we should note Augustine's mature exegesis of Acts 4:31–2 (‘they were all filled with the Holy Spirit … </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul’). Augustine uses the function of the Spirit within the Christian community as an analogy for the Spirit's eternal role in the Trinity:</p>
<p class="calibre1">[if] many souls through love are one soul, and many hearts are one heart, what does the very fountain of love do in the Father and the Son? … If, therefore, ‘the love of God [which] has been poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us’ makes many souls one soul and many hearts one heart, how much more  <b class="calibre3">(p. 130) </b>does [the Spirit] make the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit one God, one light, one cause? ( <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the Gospel of John</i> 39.5) We should read such statements against the background of Augustine's exegesis of Jn 5:19, which presented the Son as identical to the intra-divine acts that Scripture predicates of him. The Spirit is understood as love, as identical with love itself, as the eternal act of love. Just as God's Word is not insubstantial like our words, but eternally spoken and eternally existing, so too the Spirit as love exists eternally and distinctly, eternally given by Father to Son and Son to Father, eternally breathed by the Father as the one who constitutes the divine unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most controversial aspects of Augustine's theology—not in his own day, but in medieval and modern debat—has been his argument that the Spirit should be said to ‘proceed’ from Father and from Son. While some other Patristic figures, Greek and Latin, take a similar position, Augustine offers the most extensive reflections. His account is founded, once again, on the Scriptural texts stating that the Spirit is ‘of’ the Father and ‘of’ the Son. Although we always go through or into Scripture using the temporal language of the created order, Augustine sees no temporality in the procession of Son and Spirit: one does not proceed from the Father ‘before’ the other. Indeed, for Augustine, it is in the eternal act of generating the Son that the Father gives it to him that the Spirit proceed from him—part of what it is to be the Son is to be one who has by nature the Father's Spirit. We need almost to say that when the Father generates the Son from his essence and gives the Son all that he is, what the Father gives is the Spirit. In order for the Son to be one who shares all that the Father is, the Son must have this Spirit. The Son's love for the Father, his loving of the Father, is the Spirit that he is. And thus, from eternity the Spirit comes to be the one who is common to Father and Son, who is the love of both by being ‘of’ and ‘from’ both (on Augustine's theology of the Spirit's procession see Ayres 2010: ch. 9; Daley 2001a and 2001b). </p>
<p class="calibre1">We must take one further step. If the Father gives to Son and Spirit all that he is, such that each is truly God, then each must be wisdom, rationality, life, truth, and love itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have already noted this, but now we can draw a further conclusion. Each must embody the fullness of what it is to be a ‘person’ in ways that transcend human imagination</p>
<p class="calibre1">—to be fully God involves possessing all the characteristics of the highest form of life in perfection, and thus possessing all that characterizes human personality in transcendent Page 8 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">perfection. And thus in Augustine's theology, to assert that the Spirit is God is necessarily also to assert that the Spirit is irreducible divine ‘person’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the mystery of the Trinity requires us to reflect on the unity of the three whenever we reflect on one of the divine three as individual, and in his  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> Augustine uses the analogical language of memory, understanding, and will to speak of the divine life, and writes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">we should so conceive these three [memory, understanding, will] as some one thing which all have, as in the case of wisdom itself, and which is so retained in the nature of each one, as that he who has it, is that which he has … in that simple and highest  <b class="calibre3">(p. 131) </b>nature, substance is not one thing, and love another, but that substance itself is love, and that love itself is substance, whether in the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit, and yet the Holy Spirit is properly called love. ( <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Trinity</i> 15.17.28–9; Augustine 1963: 493)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, because there is one simple and divine nature, we must be careful not to speak only of each of the divine three as fullness, without also noting that the fullness that they possess in such a way that they are identical with it is the one fullness that is God. I said a little while ago that it is  <i class="calibre4">as if</i> the Spirit were the essence of Father and Son: we can now see that this statement is not quite right. That the Spirit is named as love should not lead us toward a picture of Father and Son having as their essence something that is not their own. Rather, we must say both that Father and Son are in their essence love  <i class="calibre4">and that</i> the Spirit is the love of Father and Son even while being fully another beside and in them. But once again the intellect is drawn to a point where it must confess that God transcends its grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3. </b> <b class="calibre3">One and Three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many readers will have noticed that I have not yet shown Augustine offering any extensive discussion of the language of person and nature or substance (for this section see Ayres 2010: ch. 8 and Cross 2007). Augustine thought that such language could never make logical sense when used of the divine ‘nature’. Relying on the logical discussions of the Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry, Augustine argued that anything identified by a term which specifies a species can necessarily also be identified by a corresponding genus term and vice versa. For example, if one can say ‘Socrates is a human being’, one can also say that ‘Socrates is an animal’, and for any subject, if one can say it is an animal, one can also assign it to a subordinate species. Moreover, if it is true that Socrates and Augustine are two humans, it is true that they are two animals. In the case of the divine three these rules do not obtain. There is no general class of ‘divine persons’ and the divine nature is not divisible into discrete instances. In the quasi-credal formula ‘one nature and three persons’ the terminology can be helpful, but not if we think that it isolates a particular set of philosophical terms the rules of which will enable us to understand the divine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In some texts, however, Augustine does make important use of the concept of relation. In the  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> he offers a good deal of initial discussion, focusing particularly on questions about how we should guard and shape our speech about the Trinity, questions of predication rather than directly questions of ontology. He argues that we should realize the terms ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ name ‘relations’, but not relations that are accidental (any human male called ‘Father’ became a Father at some point, the title is not his simply by virtue of being human and male). In the Trinity ‘Father’ names a relation that is eternally true of the Father: there is eternally the Father, and eternally the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 132) </b>A few years later Augustine speaks a little more directly of the ontological reality to which these patterns of predication correspond. In the 39th of his  <i class="calibre4">Tractates on John's</i> <i class="calibre4">Gospel</i> he distinguishes between human and divine existence. You and I exist and may or may not also be spoken of in relationship to each other. Father, Son, and Spirit are not only spoken of in relationship: they  <i class="calibre4">are</i> in relationship ( <i class="calibre4">ad aliquid</i>)—the relationships that the Father establishes from eternity between Father, Son, and Spirit are intrinsic to their being (Augustine  <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the Gospel of John</i> 4). Augustine is reticent about this technical language and offers it very rarely. More frequently, and as we have seen, he develops this theology in the course of directly exegetical reflection and his accounts of Jn 5:10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Acts 4:32 provide excellent and key examples of this reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Inseparable Operation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine inherits from earlier Nicene theologians the principle that Father, Son, and Spirit work or operate inseparably: in every action of one of the divine three the other two are also to be found at work. Why? Because the divine three are inseparable; they are not divided spatially or temporally, and there is only one divine will and nature even as Father, Son, and Spirit are each the fullness of that will and nature. The inseparable operation of the three is, however, a difficult principle to fill out without according each a different role in every divine action—and thus reimporting the idea that they are in fact separable! How does Augustine articulate this principle at his best? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his 23rd tractate on John Augustine considers how the world is created, offering an account that depends on his reading of Jn 5:19. We cannot envisage the Father deciding to create and giving orders to the Son who then does the actual creating. This would be to see both Father and Son as operative in the act, but only by separating out their existence and roles inappropriately: What the Father shows the Son, he does not receive from without. The entirety is done within; for there would be no creatures unless the Father had made them through the Son … the Father showed it to be made and the Son saw it to be made, and the Father made it by showing it because he made it through the Son seeing it … Neither that showing nor that seeing is temporal … But the Father's showing begets the Son's seeing in the same way as the Father begets the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Showing, of course, generated seeing; not seeing showing. If we could look more purely and more perfectly, we would perhaps find that the Father is not one thing Page 10 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">and his showing another, nor is the Son one thing and his seeing another. ( <i class="calibre4">Tractates on the Gospel of John</i> 23.11) The Father makes all things through the Son (Jn 1:3), and the Father makes by showing all to the Son. But that ‘showing’ is identical with the eternal begetting of the Son. In the Son as Word and Wisdom all that will be is already contained (he is the true Life of all things) and ‘created’, merely needing to emerge in the temporal order. But remember that Augustine is not here describing an act prior to the creation of the world: he conceives of time itself as something created. From eternity, in eternity, the Father shows <b class="calibre3">(p. 133) </b>and the Son sees, our world comes to be and time with it, founded in that eternal action of Father and Son. The acts of the divine three in time are never the result of deliberation subsequent to their generation: those acts always occur from the Father through the Son and in the Spirit, and always simultaneously with Son and Spirit coming from the Father. At the same time, there is always an order to the working of the three, an order established from eternity by the Father. The three work, one might say, in accordance with their inner Trinitarian character and relations: the Father works through Son and in Spirit; the Son works as Word and Wisdom, as the revealer of the Father, as the one in whom all things are what they are; the Spirit works as the one who brings concord and draws together in love (although Augustine never offers a clear statement of principle like this). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout his mature work Augustine consistently emphasizes that the missions of Son and Spirit—their redemptive work in the world—reveal the eternal ordering of the divine life. In other words, missions reveal ‘processions’, the coming forth of Son and Spirit from the Father. Augustine emphasizes this so strongly both because he trusts that God's love is such that God reveals himself to us truly (even as he transcends what we can understand of him), and because he sees the reformation and redemption of humanity to consist in a restoration of our seeing and knowing of the world in God, as enfolded by Word and Spirit who come from and lead us to the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Turning Inward</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine views the human being as the pinnacle of the created order. Human beings do not only exist as inanimate objects, nor do they only live as do plants and animals, they exist and live intellectually: thinking, judging, creating, and loving. It is thus in our intellectual life that we find the highest form of life we know, and it is here that we find, for Augustine, that in us which is the image of God (the image, of course, of a life which still transcends our ability to understand). For Augustine, because God is Trinity, the image of God in us must be Trinitarian as well (Sullivan 1963). Accordingly, in the latter half of his <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i>, Augustine reflects on the Trinity as it may be seen in the  <i class="calibre4">imago</i>, in the mind (on this theme see Ayres 2010: chs. 11–12; Gioia 2008). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his exploration Augustine both assumes a certain account of the mind as his point of departure, and he examines the mind  <i class="calibre4">in the light of</i> the Trinitarian beliefs he seeks to explore. In the latter respect, Augustine sees the language of faith as not only revealing Page 11 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">something about the nature of the divine existence, but also as revealing to us something about the image: Trinitarian faith is a guide to understand ourselves as well as God. And thus it is wrong to think of Augustine simply as offering ‘psychological analogies’ for the Trinity: he is not simply analysing the mind to find threefold analogies for the Trinity, but using the language of faith to explore the mind, and using what he finds there to think through how we might imagine the divine three as distinct and yet never divided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine's view of the soul is taken in part from Plotinus, in part from the Latin rhetorical tradition (particularly Cicero), and in part it is his own, developed in a long  <b class="calibre3">(p. 134) </b>reflection on the power of the memory and desire in the light of Christian belief. Augustine assumes that the human being's mental life is always an active desiring life, always seeking for that which it thinks is its natural home and end. At the same time the mind's seeking and desiring is constantly shaped by its memory. The mind is for Augustine a vast mysterious storehouse—indeed not even a passive store, but an active repository that sometimes thrusts into our conscious minds images and objects of desire that may have been long forgotten. The process of searching and acting on our memories involves the production of an ‘inner word’, as we discussed earlier in the chapter. This forming of words or images within the mind is not only an act occurring from time to time, it is an act constitutive of the knowing and loving mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine differentiates between two modes of the mind's life. The fallen mind seeks to know itself as if it were a distant object to be found elsewhere. This is the mode of knowing with which we (fallen human beings) are most familiar because we have become obsessed with created objects. But this vision of intellectual life as lacking and seeking for what lies without does not well illustrate the perfect knowing and self-presence of the divine life. The mind, however, must know itself in order to seek itself and, Augustine argues following Neoplatonic precedent, in some way the whole of the mind is present to itself simply as mind. The trouble is that even though the mind is necessarily present to itself we cannot stop images of those things that we have come to desire occluding our vision. And thus we can better understand the mind as an image of the Trinity if we can work toward imagining the self-present knowing life that must be ours. But while we can imagine some features of this life (and the language of Trinitarian faith helps us understand), we will only come into a fuller sight of it when we are transformed and purified through grace, knowing ourselves as we are and that we exist in the constantly present Truth who is the Word. The image in us will then shine forth, but not only because it knows itself, but because it will be a threefold life attentive to and enfolded in God's own life, knowing all things in this light. Thus Augustine offers us an account of an image present and yet eschatologically realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a terminology to express the threefold structure of our mental life Augustine makes use of the triad memory, intelligence, and will. This triad originates with Cicero and is part of a wider tradition in Latin rhetorical literature that seeks to describe the different aspects or skills of the attentive and/or well-educated and focused mind. The same tradition also makes use of similar terminologies to describe the different constituent parts of prudence, the virtue lying at the heart of the practical life, the virtue of judging good Page 12 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">from evil (and which for Augustine and Ambrose finds its foundation and end in clinging in love to God). Augustine does not use this triad as a standard terminology for the mind, even though his account of the mind as constantly in act appears many times elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, in some ways it is problematic to have spent so much time in this chapter exploring the explorations of the second half of the  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i>. These reflections are to be found uniquely there, although various aspects of the conclusions are to be found through his later work. They are then not so much representative of how Augustine writes about and teaches the Trinity, but they do constitute one of the most imaginative and fascinating products of Augustine's theological genius. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 135) 4. </b> <b class="calibre3">Sources and Influence</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine is a complex figure to interpret, in many ways highly traditional, in others highly innovative. From the first winter after his conversion, even before his baptism at Easter 387, Augustine began reading the great Latin theologians of his age: Ambrose of Milan for certain, probably Marius Victorinus his fellow North African, and soon after Hilary of Poitiers. A number of figures who are slightly less well known such as Damasus (Bishop of Rome 366–84) also soon seem to have figured as authorities. Throughout his long career Augustine returned to these sources at a number of key points. Although a number of these figures—especially Ambrose—drew deeply on contemporary Greek Nicene sources, Augustine himself offers virtually no clear evidence that he ever drew extensively on Greek Trinitarian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Augustine draws deeply on his predecessors, he is also willing to move beyond them in striking ways. In part this follows from his being of a later generation: despite his mother's experience of participating in Ambrose's public confrontation with ‘Arians’ in 386, Augustine takes Nicene Trinitarian doctrine as a point of departure for exploration as much as he takes it as something to be proved from scratch (to understand the theology of these Latin ‘Arians’ see the pamphlet described by Augustine as an Arian ‘sermon’; Augustine 1995b: 133–8). He is even able to criticize his predecessors when he sees them as having not taken a logical step that Nicene theology demands. Thus, for example, he finds it natural to extend to Son and Spirit the title(s) of being ‘alone true God’ that Jn 17:3 accords the Father alone, and which both Ambrose and Hilary find difficult to interpret. At the same time he celebrates the very idea of a mysterious unity of three (who remain undivided) that defeats our patterns of numbering. In this last move we see parallels in some texts of Gregory Nazianzen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the problems with interpreting Augustine is the extent and character of his influence. Over time Augustine was increasingly read in cultural contexts different from his own, and mined for answers to questions that did not yet exist when he wrote or for definitions of terminologies that he (sometimes intentionally) failed to define precisely. The character of some of his more idiosyncratic and speculative discussions was also lost when they were read as if part of a clearly organized and finished theological system (especially if all the Fathers of the Church were thought to agree). Thus, for example, while Page 13 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a><b class="calibre3">Augustine on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">some later writers follow Augustine in asserting the philosophical uselessness of genus and species terminologies for exploring the divine existence, most present Augustine simply as the most articulate of the Latin Nicene theologians of his period. He is also read in the light of later attempts in Latin tradition to define the now standard Trinitarian terminologies with precision (especially following the work of Boethius ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.480–525)). Many medieval and post-medieval theologians—especially in the Thomist tradition after the thirteenth century—also treat the interrelationship between love and knowledge as two necessary moments in intellectual life. In part this development shows the centrality that Augustine's legacy had taken on in Latin Christianity; in part it also  <b class="calibre3">(p. 136) </b>shows how his more tentative ideas and explorations could take on a life of their own in a developing tradition. An increasingly clear and central account of knowledge, love, and the interrelationship between the two enabled, for example, a far clearer and easier analogy for describing the relationship between Son and Spirit than we find in Augustine himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the very long term the development of this theme also creates resources for those (such as Hegel and some post-Hegelian idealists) who tend to see the life of Spirit, whether divine or human, as having the same fundamental structure. I offer no judgement on these later theologies: their existence reveals both the importance of Augustine as an influence within Latin Christianity, and the complexities and fruitful tensions that may appear within that tradition when it is explored as a diverse and developing tradition, when Augustine himself is separated from the readings of him that later emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far from relativizing Augustine's importance, such a procedure may even increase his importance as historical scholarship continues to give us a more and more richly textured account of the conversations that constitute the Latin Trinitarian tradition (Ayres 2011). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Suggested Reading</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Through this chapter I have referred to Augustine's  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i>, to his sermons, and to his Tractates on John (a tractate is a type of sermon).  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> is often treated as a point of departure for understanding Augustine. The work was, however, intended for readers with a good grasp of the fundamentals of Trinitarian doctrine. As a basic reading list of other Trinitarian texts in Augustine I suggest beginning with Augustine's exegesis of John:  <i class="calibre4">Tractates</i> 1–3 first, then  <i class="calibre4">Tractate</i> 39 and 19–23.  <i class="calibre4">Letters</i> 120 and 238 also offer excellent introductions to his basic teaching, and  <i class="calibre4">Sermons</i> 52, 71, and 117 offer important discussions on various aspects.  <i class="calibre4">City of God</i> 11.10 and 24–8 offer a succinct and important summary;  <i class="calibre4">Confessions</i> 12.11.12ff. offers both another (somewhat dense) summary and a beautiful exposition of the role Scripture plays in Augustine's conception of knowing God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For some of these texts there are many translations; all of the sermons and letters are now available in the series  <i class="calibre4">The Works of Saint Augustine</i>. Below I give full bibliographical details only for those texts quoted in the text of the chapter. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines Trinitarian theology in the fifth through the eighth centuries. It focuses on Cyril of Alexandria who served as a consolidator of Cappadocian doctrine, Dionysius the Areopagite with his emphasis on God as ever greater, Maximus the Confessor whose emphasis lies on the transformation of the soul brought about by contemplating the Trinity and John Damascene who roots his Trinitarian doctrine in the unity of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It stresses the importance of hymnody for transmitting Trinitarian doctrine and considers the impact of the rise of Islam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, Cyril of Alexandria, Cappadocian doctrine, Dionysius the Areopagite, God, Maximus the Confessor, soul, John Damascene, hymnody FROM the fifth century onwards, the terms in which Christians confessed the doctrine of the Trinity both in the East and the West became in many respects settled. Confession of three ὑποστάσεις/πρόσωπα (persons) in one οὐσία (being)/φύσις (nature) became the universal language of Trinitarian Orthodoxy, in contrast to the tentative language of the fourth century. At the Council of Chalcedon, the distinction between ὑπόστασις/πρόσωπον </p>
<p class="calibre1">and οὐσία/φύσις, originally introduced by Basil the Great in the context of Trinitarian theology, was applied to Christology, and for the most part thereafter theological reflection was driven by Christology. Christological terminology took longer to settle, and refinements in Christological terminology could have implications for Trinitarian theology. Nevertheless, although there are developments in the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity in the East in the period from the fifth to the eighth century, these take for granted a settled Trinitarian terminology. One might almost say that this lack of interest in further definition in matters of Trinitarian confession was replaced by celebration. This is true for several of the theologians of our period, but we also find in our period an increasing tendency to express theology in song. Apart from a few—strikingly Trinitarian—hymns of great antiquity, notably the hymn φῶς ἱλαρόν (‘O joyful light’) and the little doxology (‘Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages’), Byzantine hymnology seems to commence in the sixth century. From two Page 1 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> of Dorotheos of Gaza's  <i class="calibre4">Instructions</i>, we know that passages from Gregory Nazianzen's homilies were being sung as hymns in the sixth century, and later on Byzantine hymnology frequently consists of centos from the homilies of the Theologian ( <i class="calibre4">Instructions</i> 16–17; Regnault and Préville 1963: 458–87). Also in the sixth century, Romanos the Melodist's <i class="calibre4">kontakia</i> (essentially verse sermons) consist of theological reflection expressed as song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the concerns of the time, this theological reflection is mostly Christological, but in the  <i class="calibre4">kontakion</i> on the Theophany, or Epiphany, of the Lord, Romanos  <b class="calibre3">(p. 139) </b>compares the manifestation of God at the baptism in the Jordan to various examples of God's self-manifestation in the Old Testament. Among these is the revelation of God to Isaias in Isa. 6, in which he beheld God's glory hymned by the seraphim. Romanos comments on this: ‘Holy, holy is the one who became incarnate, Holy are you, O God; we sanctify thirdly a holy one of the holy ones’ ( <i class="calibre4">Cant</i>. 6, str. 7, ll. 7–8; Maas and Trypanis 1963: 44)—alluding to the increasingly popular theological expression about ‘one of the Trinity’ (itself of primarily Christological significance). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Cyril of Alexandria</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The dominance of Christology in this period has meant that the Trinitarian theology of Cyril has only recently received much attention. His concern with Trinitarian theology is explicit mostly in his earlier writings, before the Christological controversy broke out in 428 over Nestorios’ teaching: the  <i class="calibre4">Thesaurus, Dialogues on the Trinity</i>, and his  <i class="calibre4">Commentary on the Gospel of St John</i>. Cyril's Trinitarian theology, as we find it in these works, is manifestly indebted both to the Alexandrian tradition of Athanasios and Didymos the Blind and to the Cappadocian tradition. Both these traditions had been refined by engagement with what seemed to the Orthodox protagonists the long-running fourth-century Arian controversy (though this sense of a single controversy seems less credible to most modern scholarship): Athanasios was mostly concerned with Arius and his immediate successors, especially Asterius, while the Cappadocians faced the so-called neo-Arianism of Eunomios. The legacy of Athanasios’ engagement with Arianism is found in the emphasis on the consubstantiality of the Son (and the Spirit) with the Father, and also in the distinction between θεολογία and οἰκονομία, for an important part of Athanasios’ argument concerned the distinction between attribution to Christ θεολογικῶς, that is, attribution to Christ to eternal divine attributes, and attribution to Christ οἰκονομικῶς, that is, attribution of Christ of human attributes on account of his assumption of human nature in the divine economy, that is, in the Incarnation; confusion of these modes of attribution had led the Arians to argue that the only-begotten God, that is, Christ, was mutable. The legacy of the Cappadocian engagement with Eunomios is manifest in an insistence on the mystery of the Trinitarian Godhead—an  <i class="calibre4">apophatic</i> emphasis, that denies the adequacy of any human concepts, when applied to the divine mystery—as well as a related awareness that names do not refer to the essence of the beings named, but rather to their activity or impact. Cyril weaves these emphases together in a striking and original way. His emphasis on the mystery of God does not lead to any sense of the remoteness of God, for it goes along with a sense of the intimacy and inseparability, expressed in his use of the word ἴδιος (‘proper’ or ‘[his] own’) found in the Trinitarian relationships, as well as in the union Page 2 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> of human and divine in Christ, which is extended to the union between Christ's body and the Eucharistic elements, through which we are brought into communion with the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This sense of intimacy is also expressed in Cyril's use of analogies such as a flower and its perfume: to smell a flower is to smell its  <b class="calibre3">(p. 140) </b>perfume; indeed his fondness for vivid imagery is one of the striking features of his Trinitarian theology. Alongside features that Cyril shares with the two traditions of Trinitarian theology to which he is indebted, we can detect a growing confidence in his handling the themes of this theology. Like Basil he distinguishes between being/essence (οὐσία) and ὑπόστασις; like Gregory of Nazianzos he identifies ὑπόστασις and πρόσωπον; indeed one of the marks of Cyril's originality is his introduction of the term πρόσωπον to Orthodox Trinitarian theology, or at any rate its use on a regular basis (Boulnois 1994: 330). He handles with assurance the Cappadocian way of distinguishing between the ὑποστάσεις of the Godhead in terms of their ἰδιώματα; he uses more frequently, and confidently, than the Cappadocian Fathers the term ‘mode of existence’ (τρόπος τῆς ὑπάρξεως) to identify the distinct divine persons (Boulnois 1994: 311). He is also concerned about the mutual relationships of the persons of the Trinity, seeing the Spirit as proceeding from ((ἐκ) the Father, but coming forth (προιέναι) through (διά) the Son. Such passages were later to be cited as Greek support for the Latin  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, though Cyril's concern was rather different, namely, to affirm the Son's ‘unity of substance with the Father, a fully divine status which the Son has himself received in being begotten’ (Daley 2003: 147). This more assured use of Cappadocian terminology ushers in a new stage in Trinitarian theology, in which the notion of the consubstantial Trinity is taken for granted, as a kind of revealed premise. This is manifest, too, in the way in which the term ὁμοούσιος is applied not just to the relationship between the Son (and the Spirit) to the Father, as with Athanasios, but is applied to the term τρίας itself, and indeed in the relative frequency with which he uses the term τρίας, in contrast with fourth-century use. This sense of a settled doctrine of the Trinity is also found when Cyril refers to the ‘One Godhead in three hypostases’ ( <i class="calibre4">Adv. Nest</i>. V.6; Pusey 1869–77: 6.133, ll. 20–1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This greater assurance in his use of terminology is partly down to his being more familiar with philosophical terminology, mostly derived from Neoplatonic commentary on Aristotle. But in all this, Cyril can be seen to be on a cusp in the development of the formulation of Trinitarian theology, for there is still manifest in his language the sense, prominent in Athanasios and the Cappadocians, that ‘God’, Θεός, refers primarily to the Father, as well as in his conviction that, although the activity of the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> is indivisible, it is possible to discern within this single activity the distinct contributions of the Persons of the Trinity, for ‘everything is certainly from the Father, through the Son, and in the Holy Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">On John</i> 17:1; Pusey 1869–77: 4.661, ll. 13–14;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Boulnois 1994: 577–89). The older sense of starting from the distinct persons is manifest in Cyril's way of referring to ὁ Θεὸς καὶ Πάτηρ (‘the God, [who is] also Father’) and ὁ Θεός Λόγος: a usage which continues in the Byzantine tradition (not least in liturgical texts). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> <b class="calibre3">A Neoplatonic Strand</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Cyril makes use of Neoplatonic logic, this is clearly subordinated to a Trinitarian theology that has its roots in the Scriptures and in the early traditions of theology that Cyril regarded as Orthodox. There are other expressions of Trinitarian  <b class="calibre3">(p. 141) </b>theology in the Greek East where this is less clear. Two examples will be discussed here: Synesios of Cyrene and the theologian who wrote under the name of Dionysios the Areopagite, the judge of the Areopagus converted by the Apostle Paul, according to the account in Acts 17. Synesios was a somewhat older contemporary of Cyril's, a learned philosopher and local Alexandrian politician, who was consecrated bishop of Ptolemaϯs by Cyril's uncle and predecessor, Theophilos. His mentor in philosophy was the learned pagan Neoplatonist, Hypatia, who died a victim of the Christian mob in the early years of Cyril's episcopate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the one who called himself Dionysios the Areopagite we know scarcely anything. He, too, was indebted to Neoplatonism, though of the kind associated with the Athenian  <i class="calibre4">diadochos</i>, Proklos, was likely of Syrian provenance, and wrote probably towards the end of the first quarter of the sixth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Synesios’ Trinitarian theology is found in some of his hymns, in this following a tradition as obviously Neoplatonic as Christian, the nearest parallel being with another Christian Neoplatonist, Marius Victorinus (though Gregory of Nazianzos’  <i class="calibre4">Poemata arcana</i> constitute another striking parallel). His Trinity is paradoxical. It is much closer to the Neoplatonic trinity of the One, Intelligence, and Soul than anything in Athanasios, the Cappadocians or Cyril; there is emanation from one ὑπόστασις to another (though he does not use the term ὑπόστασις), but at the same time, there is a kind of identity between the three ὑποστάσεις, which recalls the way in which Porphyry tended to collapse the Plotinian ὑποστάσεις into one another. The effect of this is to remove from his doctrine of the Trinity any trace of subordinationism, though perhaps at the price of a taint of Sabellianism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For what is not yours, Prince? Father himself, father of all fathers, forefather without father, Son of himself, the One prior to [the number] one, seed of beings, centre of all, Intelligence prior to any being’ ( <i class="calibre4">Hymn</i> 1.144–52; Lacombrade 1978: 49). The coequality of Synesios’ Trinity is implied by its being both monad and triad: ‘I hymn you, monad, I hymn you, triad; being triad you are monad, being monad you are triad; this intellectual division preserves inseparable what is still distinct’ (ibid., 210–16; Lacombrade 1978: 50). It is a further feature of Synesios’ Trinity that the third person, the holy breath (πνοιά, not πνεῦμα), is feminine:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I hymn you, first-begotten offspring and primary radiance. Most splendid offspring of the ineffable Father, and together with you, Blessed One, I hymn the fruit of the Father's travail that comes after you, the fecund will, the mediating principle, the holy breath, centre of the begetter and centre of the child. At once mother, at once sister, at once daughter, delivering the hidden root. ( <i class="calibre4">Hymn</i> 2.87–105; Lacombrade 1978: 63)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> Synesios’ hymns were to echo among the elite scholars of Byzantium, and, perhaps more surprising, some of the hymns (though not the Trinitarian ones) seem, from the manuscript tradition, to have been used liturgically (Lacombrade 1978: 11). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A more profound influence on the liturgical tradition of the Byzantine East is found in our other Neoplatonist, Dionysios the Areopagite. Like Synesios, Dionysios can express his Trinitarian theology in prayer:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Triad beyond being, beyond godhead, beyond goodness, guardian of the theosophy of Christians, guide us to the highest peak of hidden oracles, beyond unknowing and any radiance; whence the simple, absolute and unchanging mysteries of <b class="calibre3">(p. 142) </b>theology are veiled in the dazzling cloud of mystically hidden silence, and shining beyond radiance in the deepest darkness fill to overflowing in what is utterly impalpable and invisible the sightless intellects with splendours beyond beauty! ( <i class="calibre4">De mystica theologia</i> 1.1; Heil and Ritter 1991:141, l. 1–142, l. 4) In chapter 2 of the  <i class="calibre4">Divine Names</i>, Dionysios expounds his understanding of the Trinity in a combination of technical terminology and vivid imagery. He introduces a contrast between ‘unions’ (ἑνώσεις) and ‘distinctions’ (διακρίσεις) among the names applied to God, and furthermore argues that these names can be applied either in a unified way or by way of distinction. Unified unions are names that are attributed to the Godhead itself, and equally to all the persons of the Trinity—names such as being, godhead, goodness (though in attribution to God they become ὑπερούσιος ὕπαρξις (‘existence beyond being’), ὑπέρθεος θεότης (‘godhead beyond godhead’), etc.)—he also calls them ‘common names’, echoing Cappadocian usage; distinct unions refer to the distinct persons of the Trinity—names such as Father, Son and Holy Spirit; unified distinctions apply to the Incarnation; and distinct distinctions to the divine energies, or the works of providence. He also speaks of the Trinity in terms of imagery: three lamps giving a single radiance ( <i class="calibre4">De divinis nominibus</i> 2.4; Suchla 1990: 127, l. 13–128, l. 2), or, ‘the Father is the originating Source of the Godhead, and the Son and the Spirit are divine shoots, and, as it were, flowers and transcendent lights of the divinely fruitful divinity’ (ibid., 2.7; Suchla 1990: 132, ll. 1–3). Although there are evident reminiscences of Prokline Neoplatonism and its sources in the Chaldaean Oracles, what is being expressed in this terminology seems recognizably Cappadocian. Dionysios also makes use of the terminology of monad and triad, which is frequent in Gregory Nazianzen's works, both his sermons and his poems, saying in the last chapter of  <i class="calibre4">Divine Names</i>:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore the Godhead beyond all, hymned as monad and triad, is neither monad, nor triad, as understood by us or any other being, but that we may truly celebrate its being beyond all union and its divine fecundity by a threefold and single divine naming, we name that which is beyond any naming known to beings as beyond being. (ibid., 13.3; Suchla 1990: 229, ll. 6–10) Dionysios’ legacy is to give space to the use of precise language in relation to the Trinity, while preserving a sense of the unfathomable mystery of the Godhead. The use of the prefix ὑπερ‐, while not his invention, was popularized by him and becomes characteristic of Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> Byzantine theology. He also reminds later theologians that in using language of God we are not defining the undefinable God, but rather celebrating—or ‘hymning’—the One who is beyond any conception we may have of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Sixth-Century Developments</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Theological reflection in the sixth century was driven by Christology, and in particular the need to define in a tolerable way the notion of the person, and in particular to defend the Chalcedonian confession of Christ as uniting two natures in a single person  <b class="calibre3">(p. 143)</b> against the objections of those who rejected Chalcedon, called by their opponents monophysites. The repercussions of this reflection for Trinitarian theology were, for the most part, relatively slight. One weapon, however, that was seized by the monophysites was the clarification provided by Aristotle's notion of substance ( <i class="calibre4">cf. Categories</i> 5). Aristotle's distinction between first and second substance (πρώτη and δευτέρα οὐσία) was seen to imply that only first substance is real, second substance being simply conceptual. This was used to argue against the notion of a single person uniting two natures, but it had implications for Trinitarian theology, too, for it implied that Father, Son, and Spirit were three first substances, and so three gods. This entailment was accepted by the great logician and philosopher John Philoponos, a prominent monophysite. The controversy over ‘tritheism’ took place in the monophysite camp, dividing them one against another (Ebied et alii 1994–2003; Wickham 1993). Among the Chalcedonians, it was taken to be a lesson about the dangers of philosophy in theological matters: a warning echoed in John Damascene's <i class="calibre4">Against the Jacobites</i>, where he asserts that monophysite tritheism is down to their reverence for ‘St Aristotle’ ( <i class="calibre4">Contra Jacobitas</i> 10; Kotter 1969–88: 4,113). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further insight into the concerns of sixth-century Trinitarian theology is found in a work by Job the monk, a sixth-century Chalcedonian theologian from Constantinople, our knowledge of whom is derived entirely from codex 222 of Photios’  <i class="calibre4">Bibliotheca</i> (Henry 1959–91: III,152–227). The work Photios discusses, and liberally quotes from, is called <i class="calibre4">Περὶ τῆς Οἰκονομίας</i> (‘On the Economy’ or ‘On the [Incarnate] Dispensation’), but he also mentions a work, now lost,  <i class="calibre4">Against Severos</i>, which confirms a sixth-century date for our theologian. Although, as we would expect in the sixth century, the treatise is on the Incarnation, it raises several questions that pertain to Trinitarian theology. At the very beginning of the book, the question is raised: ‘Why was it the Son, and not the Father or the Holy Spirit, that was clothed in our form?’ (Codex 222: 181b10–12; Henry 1959–91: III, 153). A little later on in Photios’ discussion, the question of appropriation is raised: for example, the work of creation is sometimes especially attributed to the Father or the Spirit, though such attributes are common to all the persons of the Trinity (and, indeed, in this case, there are plenty of places in Scripture where creation is attributed to the Son); similarly, our salvation is attributed to the Son (Codex 222: 187a; Henry 1959–91: III,168–9). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another Trinitarian question raised concerns the order of the persons of the Trinity: why is the Father first, followed by the Son and then the Holy Spirit (Codex 222: 192b23–6; Henry 1959–91: III,184)? Despite the fact that the treatise is called  <i class="calibre4">On the Economy</i>, the eternal Trinity is the starting point. We have seen an early example of this in Cyril of Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> Alexandria, but with him the doctrine of the Trinity, θεολογία, is never completely detached from the divine economy; sooner or later, however, the doctrine of the Trinity becomes a revealed fact in itself. The way that the Logos comes to be called ‘one of the Trinity’, as in the so-called theopaschite formula, canonized at the Fifth Ecumenical Council, held in Constantinople in 553, encourages a way of understanding the Incarnation whereby ‘one of the Trinity’ takes flesh and lives a human life. Given that the Trinity is coequal, it is hard not to find oneself asking: Which one? The other questions have a similar basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the ὁμοούσιος was defended in the latter half of the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 144) </b>fourth century by the doctrine that the activity (ἐνέργεια) of the persons of the Trinity is one and the same. But that then raises the question as to why the Father is spoken of as creator, the Spirit as sanctifying, and so on; the language of appropriation (οἰκείωσις) might suggest that such attribution to the individual persons of the Trinity is no more than a way of speaking. Likewise, why should there be any preferred order in a coeternal and coequal Trinity? All these questions arise because the origins of the doctrine of the Trinity in the divine economy have been forgotten, and instead the Trinity is functioning as an independent revealed given. Job's response to the question of why the Son, rather than the Father or the Spirit, became incarnate is instructive:</p>
<p class="calibre1">This [Photios says] is what he considers a solution: that, since the Son is word or λόγος, and man, who had been honoured by the λόγος and image of God, has fallen from these and been abandoned to the level of the beasts without intelligence and become like them, therefore the Word has come to dwell among those who have fallen into unreason (ἀλογία), to repair our fall and restore us to our ancient dignity. For it is said, ‘the Word became flesh’, that is, he has assumed our nature that had fallen into unreason, lost all aspiration for the intelligible and became completely given over to the fleshly, ‘and dwelt among us’. (Codex 222: 181b13–</p>
<p class="calibre1">21; Henry 1959–91: III,153)</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, Job's response is to piece together one way of expressing the economy of salvation, in which the role of the Son, as Word or Logos, seems intrinsic to him. Photios evidently found these responses of value for his own reflections, as they are repeated (in, admittedly, a more systematic way) in his own theological treatises, the  <i class="calibre4">Amphilochia</i> (Louth 2006: 216–17). Put another way: why did the Father and the Spirit not become incarnate together with the Son?—a question that might arise from a strong sense of the unity of the divine nature. This question remains an issue in the succeeding centuries. For example, Anastasios of Sinai deals with the question several times (in slightly different forms) in his  <i class="calibre4">Viae Dux</i> (towards the end of chapter 16 and in chapters 17 and 24) (Uthemann 1981: 269–70, 271–3, 315–20). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Maximos the Confessor</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity in the thought of Maximos is a kind of overarching presence, lying behind and above everything, but to which he only occasionally directs his attention. It would be quite mistaken to suggest that it is unimportant for him or taken for Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> granted, but it is, nonetheless, quite difficult to bring into focus. At the beginning of his second  <i class="calibre4">Century on Theology</i> and his  <i class="calibre4">Fifteen Chapters</i>, there are formal statements of his understanding of the Trinity. So, for example, the first chapter of the second century begins: God is one because there is one godhead: a monad, unoriginate, simple, beyond being, without parts, indivisible; the same monad and triad; the same wholly monad, the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 145) </b>same wholly triad; the same wholly monad in respect of its being, the same wholly triad in respect of the ὑποστάσεις. For the godhead is Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and the godhead is in Father, Son and Holy Spirit. ( <i class="calibre4">Capita theologiae et oeconomiae</i>, II.1; PG 90, 1124D–1125A) These are settled statements, in precise language, expressing the accepted faith of the Church, still in touch with some of the characteristic emphases of the Cappadocians (e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">it is the Father who is the principle of unity of the Godhead); there are also traces of Neoplatonic inspiration (by way of Dionysios?), but hauled back into the more Middle Platonic notions found in the Cappadocians (e.g. the Logos almost seems to be the Plotinian second ὑπόστασις, Νοῦς, Ν <i class="calibre4">o¤r</i>, but nonetheless the first ὑπόστασις, the Father, is also intellect). </p>
<p class="calibre1">We find very similar credal assertions of the doctrine of the Trinity in the  <i class="calibre4">Commentary on</i> <i class="calibre4">the Lord's Prayer</i> and in the  <i class="calibre4">Mystagogia</i>. In both cases, contemplation of the Trinity is represented as the summit of the soul's ascent (indeed, the two passages seem to be very closely related: the passage in the commentary on the Our Father being an expansion of the one in the  <i class="calibre4">Mystagogia</i>). The passage from the  <i class="calibre4">Mystagogia</i> runs thus: The Word then leads [the soul] to the knowledge of theology made manifest after its journey through all things, granting it an understanding equal to the angels as far as this is possible for it. He will teach it with such wisdom that it will know God to be one, one nature and three  <i class="calibre4">hypostaseis</i>, a trihypostatic monad of being and a consubstantial triad of  <i class="calibre4">hypostaseis</i>; monad in triad and triad in monad; neither one and another, nor one beside another, nor one through another, nor one in another, nor one from another, but the same in itself and by itself and next to itself, and with itself … a sole ray shining in the single form of one triple-splendoured light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this light the soul now equal in dignity with the holy angels, having received the luminous principles which are accessible to creation concerning the godhead and having learned harmoniously with them to praise the one godhead triadically without keeping silent, is brought to the adoption by grace through a corresponding likeness.( <i class="calibre4">Mystagogia</i> 23; Sotiropoulos 1993: 216, ll. 14–23; 218, ll. 9–15) There is a curious combination here of very precise, technical theological language—especially the use (inspired by Gregory Nazianzen and Dionysios the Areopagite) of the expression, ‘monad and triad’—and a description of the summit of the soul's deifying union with God. It is essentially a celebration of the Trinity, there is no analysis of the terminology used (though, with such technical terminology, some analysis is taken for granted). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> Scattered throughout Maximos’ writings there are, however, a series of passages of reflection inspired by a couple of mysterious passages about God as monad and triad in the sermons of Gregory Nazianzen. These passages are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore the monad is eternally moved towards the dyad until it reaches the triad. ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.2; PG 36, 76) <b class="calibre3">(p. 146) </b>And</p>
<p class="calibre1">The monad is moved because of its wealth and the dyad is superseded; for beyond matter and form, out of which bodies are made, the triad is defined on account of its perfection. ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 23.8; PG 35, 1160)</p>
<p class="calibre1">What exercises Maximos about both these passages is not, alas, the roots of these reflections in ancient (presumably Pythagorean) number theory, but the suggestion that there is movement within the eternal Godhead. It would seem that Gregory did envisage some kind of eternal movement (therefore, in a way, transcending movement), but this is something that Maximos cannot conceive. Maximos’ solution is to refer the movement to the intellect of the one seeking to understand the Trinity: If, hearing of movement, you wonder how the Godhead that is beyond infinity is moved, understand that what happens is happening to us and not to the Godhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For first we are illuminated by the reason for its being, then we are enlightened about the mode in which it subsists, for we always understand that something is before we understand how it is. Therefore movement of the Godhead is constituted by the knowledge about the fact that it is and how it subsists that comes about through revelation to those who receive it. ( <i class="calibre4">Ambigua</i> 1; PG 91, 1036C; Louth 1996: 170)</p>
<p class="calibre1">This links up with the presentation of the doctrine of the Trinity in the passages from the commentary on the Lord's Prayer and the  <i class="calibre4">Mystagogia</i> already referred to, for in these passages the understanding of the Trinity is presented, less as some objective fact, than a life-transforming experience ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Piret 1983: 70–83). We find a similar idea in Maximos’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">comments on the appearance of God as three men or angels to Abraham at the Oak of Mamre, where he addresses the problem of why Abraham saw three angels and Lot, his nephew, only two: Abraham sees the ‘triad and monad’ because of his spiritual perfection; Lot, bound to earthly affairs, cannot pass beyond the dyad ( <i class="calibre4">Quaestiones et Dubia</i> 39; Declerck 1982: 32). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is interesting to note how Maximos turns on its head Philo's interpretation of this passage, according to whom the vision of three is a lower stage than the vision of one ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Philo,  <i class="calibre4">De Abrahamo</i> 24). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A final small point (at least in terms of text involved) concerns Maximos’ attitude towards Western addition of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> to the creed. From the quotations already given, it is evident that Maximos understands the Spirit to proceed from the Father, but to come forth through the Son: the position of Cyril of Alexandria, though it is clear in Maximos that Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> this is eternally true, and belongs to the realm of  <i class="calibre4">theologia</i>. In a fragment from a letter to Marinos of Cyprus, Maximos defends the Roman Church against accusations from Constantinople that the Romans were heretical in asserting that the Spirit also proceeded from the Son (this seems to be the first indication of this being a possible bone of contention between Rome and Constantinople) ( <i class="calibre4">Opuscula theologica et polemica</i> 10; PG 91, 133B–137C, esp. 133D8–136C4). Maximos does not defend the precise accusation—that the Spirit proceeds (ἐκπορεύεσθαι) from (ἐκ) the Son; he seems to set that aside (as a misinterpretation?) and affirms that the Romans agree with Cyril of Alexandria in asserting that there is one cause within the Godhead, the Father, and that  <b class="calibre3">(p. 147) </b>the Spirit goes forth (προϊέναι) through (διά) the Son (for this interpretation, see Alexakis 2001). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was perhaps the only creative eirenic gesture in the whole history of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larchet 1998). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">John Damascene</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the evident links between Maximos the Confessor and John Damascene, the Damascene's presentation of the doctrine of the Trinity is rather different, even though they clearly are in agreement on the fundamentals of the doctrine. Whereas Maximos, as we have seen, presents the Trinity as a fundamental presupposition of Christian theology, John Damascene seems rather to unfold the doctrine of the Trinity from a starting-point that underlines Christian belief in one God. One reason for this is the source that he uses for his presentation of his Trinitarian doctrine in  <i class="calibre4">On the Orthodox Faith</i>, chapters 5–8, namely the  <i class="calibre4">Catechetical Oration</i> of Gregory of Nyssa (Mühlenberg 1996: 7.3–14.25). In that work, Gregory, too, starts from the one godhead of the Father, from which proceed Word and Spirit, so that he unfolds the doctrine of the Trinity, rather than presenting it as a revealed given. But John chose his sources in  <i class="calibre4">On the Orthodox Faith</i>; consequently we cannot simply ascribe his approach to his sources: he has chosen and endorsed them (for more detail, see Louth 2002: 100–16). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The presentation of the Trinity falls into two parts: first, the unfolding of the persons of the Trinity from the unity of God (chs. 5–7), and secondly, the lengthy exposition of the Trinitarian relationships in chapter 8. Chapter 5 begins with the unity of God, repeatedly affirming it by scriptural references, which John has added to the text of Gregory of Nyssa, thus underlining decisively his starting-point in the unity of God. He then moves on, following Gregory, to affirm that God is not irrational (ἄλογος), and therefore possesses a x03BB;όγος, as does a human being, but that God's λόγος is different from the human λόγος in being eternal, existing as a hypostasis (ἐνυπόστατος), ‘living, perfect, not existing outside [the Father], but eternally being in him’ ( <i class="calibre4">Expositio fidei</i> 6.6–7; Kotter 1969–88: 2.15). He then pursues further the analogy between God and the human person who breathes forth a word, and extends it to the Holy Spirit—again in close dependence on Gregory—arguing that the divine Spirit is different from human breath in being eternal and personal (ἐνυπόστατος). This initial section concludes with the Damascene's repeat</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> ing the argument of Gregory that Christian Trinitarianism represents a middle way between the narrow monotheism of the Jews and the polytheism of the ‘hellenes’ or pagans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chapter 8 of  <i class="calibre4">On the Orthodox Faith</i> contains a lengthy statement of the Damascene's developed Trinitarian theology. Again, he begins by iterating Christian belief in One God, ineffable and transcendent, and develops the doctrine of the Trinity by discussing the relationship of begetting between the Father and the Son, and of procession between the Father and the Spirit. He draws on a great deal of traditional imagery, such as light  <b class="calibre3">(p. 148)</b> and fire, and traditional terminology which he develops, making clear the difference between ‘unbegotten’ (ἀγέννητος) and ‘unoriginate’ (ἀγένητος), and developing the notion of ὑπόστασις as identified by its ‘way of existence’ (τρόπος ὑπάρξεως). The most original contributions of John to the doctrine of the Trinity are to be found in his notion of coinherence, περιχώρησις, and his understanding of the procession of the Spirit (once thought to be borrowed from Pseudo-Cyril,  <i class="calibre4">De Sacrosancta Trinitate</i>, now demonstrated to be fourteenth-century and dependent on John himself: Conticello 1995). The doctrine of περιχώρησις maintains that the persons of the Trinity are wholly ‘in one another’; whereas, with human beings, our common humanity is conceptual, the difference between individuals being real, in the case of the Trinity it is the opposite: their distinct individuality is conceptual, in reality there is no separate individuality, but a complete coinherence between the persons of the Trinity. In the case of the Holy Spirit, the Damascene develops hints found in the Alexandrians, Didymos the Blind and Cyril, and asserts that the Holy Spirit ‘proceeds from the Father and rests in the Son’ ( <i class="calibre4">Expositio fidei</i> 8.173; Kotter 1969–</p>
<p class="calibre1">88: 25). This seems different from the defence of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> we have found in Maximos; rather, it seems to me, John is developing an understanding of how, given that the Father is the sole source or cause (αἰτία) of the Godhead, in the procession of the Spirit from the Father, there is still a relationship (in eternity) between the Son and the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Hymnography</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite his fame and influence as a theologian, it is arguable that John's influence has been greatest as a hymnographer. Along with Cosmas the Melodist and Andrew of Crete (all of whom have links with both Damascus and Jerusalem), John is one of the originators of what became the favourite form of Byzantine hymnography, the canon. This was a series of verses, intended to accompany the canticles drawn from the Old and New Testaments that formed the climax of the dawn service ( <i class="calibre4">orthros</i> or matins). It seems to have originated in and around Jerusalem, and made its way to Constantinople at the beginning of the ninth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have already noticed that several of the theologians in our period cast their Trinitarian theology in what might be called a hymnic vein: Synesios, Dionysios, and Maximos, for instance. With the canons and other liturgical verses, this becomes the direct purpose of literary composition. As each canticle at  <i class="calibre4">Orthros</i> ends with the little doxology, the verses composed to accompany it often reflect on the doctrine of the Trinity. To give an example, the third canticle of Andrew of Crete's great penitential canon ends: Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a><b class="calibre3">Late Patristic Developments on the Trinity in the East</b> <i class="calibre4">Glory be…</i> Simple, uncreated Monad, nature without beginning, hymned in a Triad of  <i class="calibre4">ὑποστάσεις</i>, save us who worship in faith your might. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Both now …</i> O you who gave birth to God, you conceived in time without a man the timeless Son of the Father; strange wonder! Remaining a Virgin you gave suck. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 149) </b>Such examples could be multiplied. Expressed thus in song, the developed theology of the Councils came to be celebrated not simply by learned theologians, but by the whole people of God; quite precise theological notions are given expression, equally precise, through poetry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Islam</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The rise of Islam, with its strident monotheism, was bound to demand a response from Christian theologians. Such an engagement with monotheism had probably already taken place in the regions that fell to Islam in the seventh century, though then the engagement was with the monotheism of the Jews, who found a new freedom of expression under Islam. Leontios of Neapolis’ work,  <i class="calibre4">Against the Jews</i>, as well as dealing with Jewish objections to veneration of saints, icons, and relics, which they regarded as idolatry, also dealt with Jewish objections to the doctrine of the Trinity, but nothing survives of this part of the work (Thümmel 1992: 127–36). </p>
<p class="calibre1">John of Damascus was well aware of Muslim objections to the doctrine of the Trinity (Louth 2002: 76–83). In his chapter on the heresy of Islam ( <i class="calibre4">On Heresies</i> 100), he meets the Muslim accusation against Christians of being ‘associators’, those who harm monotheism by associating someone with the one God, by taking up the language of the Qur’an which speaks of the ‘word and spirit’ of God, and arguing that to deny the divinity of the word and spirit of God is to become a ‘mutilator’ of God ( <i class="calibre4">De Haeresibus</i> 100.69–77; Kotter 1969–88: 3.61–2). More interesting, perhaps, than this argument is the way in which, as we have seen above, the Damascene presents his doctrine of the Trinity: starting from an uncompromising emphasis on the unity of God, and then developing the doctrine of the Trinity by reflecting on the meaning of God's possessing word and spirit. It is difficult not to see some sensitivity (even if apologetic) to the objections of his Muslim neighbours in this approach. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article focuses on Trinitarian theology during the period from the late eighth century to the beginning of the twelfth century. It considers the works of Alcuin of York, Anselm of Canterbury, Gottschalk of Orbais, and John Scotus Eriugena. It explains that Alcuin's work on the undivided Trinity defended the Augustinian emphasis on the divine unity, whereas Eriugena drew on Greek Orthodox theology to emphasize the proper mode of action of the divine persons. Anselm relied upon the Augustinian image and defended the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> against Greek theologians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, Alcuin of York, Anselm of Canterbury, Gottschalk of Orbais, John Scotus Eriugena, undivided Trinity, divine unity, Greek Orthodox theology, divine persons, Filioque FROM the late eighth century to the beginning of the twelfth century few theologians had the confidence to explore the mystery of the Trinity. Alcuin of York, father of the Carolingian renaissance, and Anselm of Canterbury, progenitor of rational theology, mark the start and the end of the period and are also the main contributors to the development of Trinitarian theology during these centuries. As theological thinkers they are on different levels but their shared perception of the relationship between unity and Trinity in the divine identifies the main line of thought in the Western tradition. Few individuals dared suggest modifications to the  <i class="calibre4">opinio communis</i> and they met with limited sympathy and understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Alcuin's Manual on the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Having retired to St Martin's monastery in Tours, Alcuin did not put the spiritual welfare of the Frankish emperor or his subjects behind him. Around 802 he finished  <i class="calibre4">On the Faith</i> <i class="calibre4">of the Holy and Undivided Trinity</i> which is a magisterial exposition of the fundamental article of faith and a demonstration of its significance for the body of Christian doctrine. In the letter of dedication, addressed to Charlemagne as newly crowned Roman emperor, Alcuin explained the purpose of the work: in order to secure the eternal bliss of his subjects Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> Charlemagne must ensure that the true faith in God's Trinity is preached throughout the realm; in order to facilitate this daunting task Alcuin offers his manual for use as a textbook in the training of theologians and preachers. Concern for orthodoxy was nothing new in the nascent Carolingian empire; what was new was Alcuin's insistence on orthodoxy in Trinitarian theology as such. Presumably the resurgence and spread of adoptionism in Spain had made Alcuin aware that the fundamentals of Christian religion could <b class="calibre3">(p. 156) </b>not and should not be taken for granted and that advanced theological education was a necessity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The historical circumstances of the work and the author's guiding motive must be taken into consideration when assessing the significance and importance of Alcuin's manual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The volume cannot be said to be original inasmuch as it is a patchwork of excerpts lifted from the writings of the Church Fathers and especially Augustine (Cavadini 1991). Alcuin openly admitted to writing only what he had found in the works of the Fathers; as he said, those who seek a deeper understanding of God's Trinity should turn to God in prayer (Alcuin 1863: 21D). This circumstance, however, does not detract from the intrinsic merit of Alcuin's work. To him the crucially important challenge was not to find something new to say but to reclaim and appropriate the heritage of the Church Fathers in order to make their thought a living force in the Church of the time. Furthermore, Alcuin's volume testifies to the author's impressive familiarity with the Patristic texts, to his literary skills in weaving together excerpts of authority as well as to his ability to select significant passages and organize them so as to present a clear and coherent exposition. During the Carolingian period Alcuin's manual of Trinitarian doctrine was admired and seen as a testimony on a par with the writings of the Church Fathers; it was widely distributed and popularized in the form of a catechetical abbreviation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Alcuin's Understanding of the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In his manual on Trinitarian theology Alcuin followed Augustine as his guide and he concurred wholeheartedly with the African Father that ignorance of dialectic is one of the main reasons for faulty understanding of God's unity and Trinity. In the first book Alcuin explains the basic ‘facts’ of the Trinity and the categories which are employed to classify predications about God. The unity of God's substance and essence Alcuin emphasizes at the very start. Thus he stresses that God is one because the three persons of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one substance. Moreover, the three persons should not under any circumstance be thought of as three substances. Equally, there is no way God can be said to be triple ( <i class="calibre4">triplex</i>); any of the three persons is as fully God and the divine substance as two or three taken together (Alcuin 1863: 15B, 19D). The fundamental distinction between what is said of God according to His single essence and what is said of God according to the three persons Alcuin identifies as a difference between substantial and relative predication. The unity of substance guarantees that substantial predicates or attributes are said of the divine persons both when taken together and when considered in particular; such attributes should always be thought of and spoken of in the singular because of the unity of the divine essence. For instance, the essential properties of being, goodness, and Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> unity cannot be talked of in the plural so as to state that there are three gods or three good beings, even with the intention of indicating the three divine persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alcuin classifies attributes or predicates which belong to or signify the divine essence as being ‘ <i class="calibre4">ad se</i>’, which means that they indicate God's unitary being and substance. On <b class="calibre3">(p. 157) </b>the other hand, what is attributed to the three divine persons as such, Alcuin classifies as relative inasmuch as predicates of this kind are said to be with respect to something else ( <i class="calibre4">ad aliquid</i>). Since the divine persons are distinguished solely by their mutual relationships, it is strictly limited what can be said relatively ( <i class="calibre4">relative</i>). The Father gives birth to the Son and this relationship of father and son gives rise to both the Father's personal property as well as that of the Son. Accordingly, the Father is He who is from nobody else, while the Son is He who is from only one. Taking his cue from Augustine, Alcuin firmly and repeatedly insists on the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>. To him it is an established fact that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son in equal measure and, consequently, the relationship of procession gives rise to the personal property of the Spirit, which is to proceed from two (Alcuin 1863: 16D, 20A, 22B). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the predicates that are said to be substantial and ‘ <i class="calibre4">ad se</i>’ derive from and indicate the divine nature, the personal relationships and the relative properties to which they give rise seem to be incongruous with the divine. In the world of creatures what is relative belongs squarely to the accidental or non-essential. In God, however, nothing is incidental or changeable; divine nature is immutable and timeless. To Alcuin it is incumbent to explain that the divine relationships and the predicates which signify these relations do not compromise divine nature for the simple reason that the personal relationships in God are eternal and immutable just as the persons are as timeless and unchangeable as the divine essence (Alcuin 1863: 19A sqq.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Summing up the main points established in the first book Alcuin focuses on the ten Aristotelian categories and elucidates how predicates which accrue to God should be classified. Firstly, Alcuin states, what is said of God in ‘ <i class="calibre4">ad se</i>’, that is, essential predication, belongs squarely in the category of substance. Of the other nine categories only the category of relation or ‘ <i class="calibre4">ad aliquid</i>’ is directly applicable to talk of God. This is the category of the personal predicates which are predicated of the divine persons in a relative and non-accidental sense. When something is said of God which belongs in one of the remaining eight categories, one should avoid taking the sentence at face value. Statements about God which contain predicates that as applied to creatures belong to categories such as, for example, position or passion should always be subjected to careful interpretation. Accordingly, when in Holy Scripture God is said to regret something this might seem to imply that there is passion in God. But this cannot be literally true since God is not subject to passions. Consequently, the statement must be conceived as figurative speech, and the theologian should strive to elicit an acceptable meaning. In the same way, God is said to be seated in Heaven which seems to imply the category of position; but this cannot be true in the literal sense and, for this reason, the statement is figurative and in need of exposition (Alcuin 1863: 22C sqq.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> As compared to Augustine's treatment in the fifth book of the  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> Alcuin shifted the main point of the discussion in a subtle way. As Alcuin writes, In all these ways Holy Scripture usually talks of God, but there is a difference between what is said properly, what is said figuratively and what is said relatively.  <i class="calibre4">In</i> <i class="calibre4">the proper sense</i> God is said to be one substance, the highest and inexpressible, who always is what He is, with whom nothing is accidental…. God is said to be Father and Son  <b class="calibre3">(p. 158) </b>and Holy Spirit in a relative manner, as we thoroughly inculcated above. But things like position, vestment, being in place and time, or undergoing passions cannot be said of God in the proper sense but only figuratively </p>
<p class="calibre1">[which means] by way of likenesses [to what obtains in the world of creation]. (Alcuin 1863: 22D–23B; Hincmar 1852: 569C) Alcuin's graduation of the ‘literalness’ of predications about God serves to underpin the absolute priority of the unity of substance in God; proper statements about God are only possible when talk is of the divine essence and substance. Predications of the personal properties or relationships are certainly not figurative but they are not on a par with what is said on the basis of God as a unitary substance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upholding this viewpoint Alcuin chose to disregard the equally pertinent and valid consideration that the term ‘substance’ is ill suited to describe the divine being, precisely because God does not receive accidents just as there is no difference between what God is, and that whereby God is what He is. The perception that God is ‘beyond substance’ is something that Alcuin would have learned from Augustine himself in the seventh book of the  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>, but it was certainly also explained in the fourth chapter of Boethius’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">small treatise on the Trinity, which Alcuin probably knew but chose to disregard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strong emphasis on the unity of the divine substance is also present in Alcuin's treatment of divine activity. God's working is exclusively linked to the divine essence or substance and as a cause of creation God is only one (Alcuin 1863: 20C, 24AC). As a matter of course, Alcuin is fully aware that many things and operations are recounted in Scripture as if they originated with or belonged to only one of the divine persons. This is true of the Father's heavenly voice which sounded at the baptism of Jesus and of the assumption of human nature in the Incarnation which is attributed to only the Son. Notwithstanding appearances, Alcuin explains, the biblical testimony does not entail that it is necessary to attribute separate operations to the divine persons. The reason for this is that the heavenly voice as well as the human flesh assumed by Christ was made by the one God, that is, the whole and undivided Trinity (Alcuin 1863: 20D). With this explanation Alcuin appears to sidestep the fundamental issue, i.e. how different manifestations and operations can be ascribed to the single divine persons. However, Alcuin makes up for this in dealing with the divine Word's assumption of human nature in chapter 10 of the third book. Here he adduces one of Augustine's well-known maxims: a work or action may be attributed to a single divine person simply because this work concerns and belongs to only this person (Alcuin 1863: 44CD). This implies that the particularization and specification of the divine person to whom a particular created object or action belongs does not Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> originate on the side of the divine person; instead, it belongs on the side of the created work or action, which as a creature is brought forth by the whole Trinity. In the case of the Incarnation, this entails that Christ's human nature was created so as to concern and belong to only the Son, whereas as a work of creation it depended on all three persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly, the incarnation does not entail that the Son operates alone or in separation from the Father or the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 159) </b>In the  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> Augustine had elaborated a complex comparison between the human soul and its faculties, on the one hand, and, on the other, the unity of essence and Trinity of persons in the divine. This part of Augustine's legacy Alcuin chose to ignore and he did not explain the reason for this omission. Alcuin may have viewed Augustine's depiction of the inner life of the Trinity by way of the analogy with the dynamic interplay of memory, reason, and will in the human soul as simply too sophisticated for the time and as something that could easily lead the more simple-minded to view the divine persons as particular beings and agents. At any rate such a misunderstanding would clearly have gone against Alcuin's obvious wish to emphasize the priority of essential unity and the propriety of essential predication. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Gottschalk's Challenge to the Carolingian Consensus</b> One of the more daring thinkers in the Carolingian period was the monk Gottschalk of Orbais, who for many years lived as an itinerant preacher and scholar. Gottschalk's free life was brought to an abrupt halt when he was charged with false teaching on divine predestination. He was condemned at a synod in Mainz in 848 and, the following year, at the provincial synod at Reims; after a public whipping he was sequestered in the abbey of Hautesville. His heresy consisted of a tenacious defence of Augustine's teaching on election and reprobation against the Pelagians and his condemnation became the start of a protracted conflict among Carolingian divines. Early in the struggle, Gottschalk's leading opponent and scourge, the archbishop Hincmar of Reims, was alerted to another heresy of Gottschalk's and this concerned the Trinity. In an attempt to gain additional support for his campaign Hincmar went to great trouble to publicize Gottschalk's doctrinal indiscretion but on this score he won scant support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprisingly, Gottschalk's contribution to Trinitarian theology appeared, at least to his opponents, to compromise Augustinian orthodoxy. The sources to Gottschalk's theology of the Trinity are relatively few. There exist several small treatises of his which have been transmitted in a single manuscript (Gottschalk 1945: ix sqq.; Tavard 1997: 40). Against Gottschalk Hincmar composed a simply monumental and complex work entitled  <i class="calibre4">De una et</i> <i class="calibre4">non trina deitate</i>. At the beginning of the work Hincmar included a set of notes which Gottschalk had sent to him and which in condensed form presented the main points of the opponent's Trinitarian ‘innovation’ (Hincmar 1852: 475C sqq.; Gottschalk 1945: 20–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> Against these notes Hincmar built up his defence of what he conceived to be Western orthodoxy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From Gottschalk's notes it transpires that the main purpose of his deliberations on the divine Trinity was to underpin the orthodox middle between polytheism or, as he called it, Arianism, on the one hand, and, on the other, the dreaded Sabellianism. In order to achieve this, Gottschalk argued, it is not enough to state that God is one nature and three <b class="calibre3">(p. 160) </b>persons. Because divine nature is not cut off from or existing outside the persons, it is warranted to say that the deity is not only one but also three. This implies, according to Gottschalk, that every single divine person is God in the full sense and, accordingly, endowed with deity as his own proper principle (Gottschalk 1945: 20; Hincmar 1852: 478C). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, divine nature is not only one it is also ‘trine’ ( <i class="calibre4">trina</i>) since it is proper to each of the divine persons (Tavard 1997: 45 sqq.). Accordingly, Gottschalk's emphasis on the less than common expression ‘ <i class="calibre4">trina deitas</i>’ was meant to provide a rationale for viewing the divine persons as substantial beings (Tavard 1997: 67–8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gottschalk took great pains to point out that this did not amount to introducing three substances in God. In order to establish this he distinguished sharply between the words </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘trine’ ( <i class="calibre4">trinus</i>) and ‘triple’ ( <i class="calibre4">triplex</i>); grammatical analysis reveals that the former does not allow of numbering while the latter indicates numerical diversity. Consequently, saying that the divine essence is trine merely implies that the attributes of divine nature, for example, being, holiness, majesty, and truth, pertain not only to divine nature but also to each of the three persons (Jolivet 1977). Equally, Gottschalk was keen to rule out the idea that his theory of the Trinity introduces a quaternity in God, i.e. that the divine nature and the three persons can be counted. Because divine nature is not distinct from the three persons it belongs to each of them in equal measure. As Gottschalk stressed repeatedly, divine nature or deity is naturally one and personally three (Tavard 1997: 65 sqq.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gottschalk's reasoning was undoubtedly based on Boethius’ definition of person as that which is ‘ <i class="calibre4">per se una</i>’, which is not surprising in view of Gottschalk's obvious expertise in and predilection for grammar and logic as well as his conviction that grammatical analysis provides the key to theology (Jolivet 1958). But Hincmar was quick to point out that Boethius’ definition of person cannot be applied to the divine without modifications and, at any rate, it was not the one favoured by Augustine, according to whom relation is what defines the divine persons (Tavard 1997: 68 sqq.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many details in Gottschalk's Trinitarian theology are rather opaque but his main motive was clearly spelled out already in the notes received by Hincmar. According to Gottschalk, it is necessary to affirm that divine nature is trine for the sole reason that divine nature did not assume human nature except in so far as it was the deity of the second person in the Trinity which became incarnate (Gottschalk 1945: 26; Hincmar 1852: 478CD). Because divine operation is inextricably tied to divine nature, Gottschalk argued, and because the divine persons are acting subjects and identifiable as subject terms, the only viable solution is to view the divine essence as both one and trine. If this is not al</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> lowed, Gottschalk thought, there would be no way to avoid Sabellianism and the ensuing heresy of Patripassianism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hincmar of Reims had little difficulty in refuting many of Gottschalk's arguments from tradition or pointing out the inherent dangers of the Boethian definition of person. Moreover, Hincmar was quick to identify and confront the main point of Gottschalk's theory. At the very start of his rebuttal he accused Gottschalk of having parted company with Alcuin</p>
<p class="calibre1">—as well as Augustine—in his analysis of divine agency in God's assumption of human nature. In order to substantiate this claim he saw fit to quote the passage from Alcuin's manual in which the latter explained the assumption of human nature on  <b class="calibre3">(p. 161) </b>the basis of Augustine's maxim (Hincmar 1852: 552C–553B). Moreover, Hincmar retorted that Gottschalk's basic perception entailed the denial of the individuality of the Trinity and, accordingly, it was a short cut to the hateful heresy of tritheism (Hincmar 1852: 553C). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">John Scotus Eriugena and the Legacy of the </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Greeks</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The great Irish scholar and theologian John Scotus Eriugena judiciously avoided public debate on Trinitarian theology. Occasionally Eriugena's interpretation of God's oneness and Trinity has been seen as similar to that of Gottschalk (Cappuyns 1933: 85; Tavard 1997: 78), but the Irishman was rather more daring than the German monk and had more considered reasons for deviating from Alcuin's well-trodden path of Augustinianism. In Eriugena's oeuvre, the Trinity is treated in the monumental  <i class="calibre4">On the Division of Nature</i> and in his exposition of the prologue of St John's Gospel. In his systematic main work Eriugena considers God's Triunity in connection with the generation of the eternal ideas in the <i class="calibre4">Verbum Dei</i> and their realization in the world of creatures through the Holy Spirit. In this context John Scotus adopts the framework and terminology of Platonic causality and the triune God is viewed as both one cause and as three interrelated causes. Accordingly, John Scotus does not hesitate to speak of the divine essence and the divine persons as </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘one essence in three substances’ just as he without further ado depicts the divine principle as ‘three subsisting causes in one essential cause’ (Eriugena 1972: 164–5). Like Gottschalk he also refers to God as ‘the triune cause of all things’ ( <i class="calibre4">trina omnium causa</i>) (Eriugena 1972: 170). The unusual terminology does not imply, however, that Eriugena distanced himself from the Augustinian heritage; he adopted Augustine's psychological explanation of the Trinity and adroitly adapted it to fit his own framework (Eriugena 1972: 174–6; Scheffczyk 1957). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eriugena's approach to and perspective on the Trinity was undoubtedly prompted by his admiration for the theological traditions of the Greek Church to which his knowledge of Greek gave him direct access. This influence is not, however, the only explanation for Eriugena's views on Trinitarian theology. The Irish luminary in Charles the Bald's ‘palace school’ perceived a need to view the divine persons as subjects in their own right and for this he needed to stress their ‘ontological’ reality. This motive transpires lucidly from Eriugena's treatment of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, which at the time had become almost a Shibboleth Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> of western orthodoxy. Against the united front of Carolingian theologians Eriugena did not waver in maintaining that the procession of the Holy Spirit originates solely from the substance that is proper to the Father, and not from the divine essence which is common to all three persons (Eriugena 1972: 200). Accordingly, the Father was the only cause of the Spirit. Eriugena's willingness to accept that the Holy Spirit proceeds ‘through the Son’ (Eriugena 1972: 188–90) was no concession to western  <b class="calibre3">(p. 162) </b>sensibility but another reflection of Greek Orthodox tradition. In order to forestall the severe criticism which his speculative audacity openly invited, Eriugena was keen to stress that the Trinity is a lofty matter which can only be imperfectly conceived of and may be even less perfectly talked about (Eriugena 1972: 200). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Anselm of Canterbury</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The divine Trinity was a subject of topical interest in three of Anselm of Canterbury's major works. The first was  <i class="calibre4">Monologion</i> which was written for the monks in Bec around 1076. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anselm's second treatment of the Trinity is found in the polemical  <i class="calibre4">Letter on the Incarnation of the Word</i> from 1094. Finally, as renowned theologian and English archbishop in exile Anselm became involved in the debate with the Greeks over the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, and his reflections on the subject were set down in the treatise  <i class="calibre4">On the Procession of the Holy Spirit</i> from 1102. Though Anselm's treatments of the Trinity originated under different circumstances and over a period of twenty-five years, they are marked by strong internal consistency and express a clear basic perception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  <i class="calibre4">Monologion</i> is a rational enquiry into the divine being and its salient characteristics in which the legacy from Augustine and his work on the Trinity is apparent throughout (Holopainen 1996). In treating of the Trinity Anselm focuses on the generation of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit as dynamic and interrelated aspects of the inner life of God. In so doing Anselm develops Augustine's psychological analogies whereas he refrains from elucidating the Trinity by way of logical terms and concepts such as ‘ <i class="calibre4">per se</i>’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">and ‘ <i class="calibre4">per aliud</i>’ predications and the categories of substance and relation (Perino 1952; Schmaus 1975). Anselm defends this choice by arguing that God as the supreme and infinite spirit and the highest good is beyond the immediate grasp of the human intellect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently, it is not possible to conceive of the divine as if it were a limited created object just as it is impossible to talk of God in the direct manner in which ordinary created things can be spoken about. This means that man's intellect must follow a more circuitous route and rely on the similitudes and analogies found in the world of creatures when meditating on God and speaking about the divine. As already Augustine had shown, the human soul presents the highest likeness to God in the created world, and for this reason the Trinity is best described in analogy with the interaction between memory, intellect, and love which characterizes the human soul (Anselm 1968: I, chs. 65–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In agreement with this, Anselm is keen to stress that it does not make any important difference which terms are used to signify unity and Trinity in the divine. With him the difference between the Latin and Greek ways of naming nature and persons in God should Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> not be allowed to overshadow the basic agreement in faith and confession. Since words like ‘substance’ and ‘person’ signify independent and separate objects in the world of creatures, it makes little difference whether the divine persons are called ‘persons’ or </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘substances’; what is important is that language does not deceive anybody into thinking <b class="calibre3">(p. 163) </b>of the divine persons as separate or mutually divided (Anselm 1968: I, ch. 78). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equally, it is not decisive whether divine nature is termed ‘essence’ or ‘substance’ as long as it is recognized that God as a substance is not subjected to accidental determinations and that his essence is not a universal nature (Anselm 1968: I, chs. 26–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around 1190 Roscelin of Compiègne, a prominent master of dialectic in the schools of northern France, provoked dismay and confusion by advancing the following consequence, If the three persons in God are only one thing ( <i class="calibre4">res</i>)—and are not three things, each one [existing] separately in itself (as do three angels or three souls) and yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">[existing] in such way that they are wholly the same in will and power—then the Father and the Holy Spirit were incarnate with the Son. (Anselm 1976: 9) This is Anselm's rendering of Roscelin's argument and the sole contemporary source for the dialectician's thought on this point (Mews 1992b). The reception accorded Roscelin's excursion into theology was less than favourable; he was summoned to the council of Soissons in 1191 (or 1192) and was forced to recant. Shortly afterwards he retracted his recantation and reaffirmed his original position. This provoked Anselm to counter in public (Mews 1992a). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anselm does not specify the original context of Roscelin's argument or his precise purpose in advancing it. On the basis of what Anselm indicates, it seems quite unlikely that Roscelin thought or argued along the lines of, for example, Gottschalk so as to target the intricate relationship between the divine essence and the divine persons, on the one hand, and, on the other, divine action in the world of creatures such as the assumption of human nature. It is far more likely that Roscelin aimed at making a logical point. To him it was evident that the proper name of ‘God's Word’ or ‘Son’ point to some thing ( <i class="calibre4">res</i>), since this is what names do. If the object pointed to by this proper name is separate and different from the two other divine persons then the incarnation may be attributed to this subject without further ado. On the contrary, if there is no such separation or division between the divine persons then it is impossible that a noun placed as subject term may designate the second person in the Trinity without at the same time pointing to the remaining two persons. In this latter scenario it will be necessary to attribute the assumption of manhood not only to the Son of God but also to the Father and the Holy Spirit, since they will be pointed to by the subject term. In other words, there are sound logical and theological reasons for accepting that the three divine persons are persons in the ordinary sense of the word, that is to say, that they are three separate things or substances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Anselm this line of reasoning is completely superficial and a patent indication of Roscelin's seriously deficient understanding of the divine. In the first place, Anselm points out that Roscelin is mistaken if he thinks that his consequence is evident. In fact, it Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> rests on an equivocation; the noun ‘thing’ ( <i class="calibre4">res</i>) is ambiguous since it can be used to signify anything which can be said to be ‘something’ ( <i class="calibre4">aliquid</i>). In other words, ‘thing’ like </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘something’ can be regarded on a par with transcendental terms. If, in the context of his argument, Roscelin interprets ‘thing’ as equivalent with ‘substance’, then he is clearly not a genuine Christian, since this entails the existence of three gods. If, on the other hand, he  <b class="calibre3">(p. 164) </b>accepts the distinction between the one nature and the three persons, who are different by way of relations and personal properties, and interprets ‘thing’ as synonymous with ‘person’, then Roscelin's argument is totally uncontroversial (Anselm 1968: II, 11–12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anselm was convinced that Roscelin wished to claim that the three divine persons are three different substances. At the same time Roscelin claimed to maintain God's unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This prompts Anselm to examine the possibility that three separate divine persons may come together so as to make up God's unity. Anselm concludes, as a matter of course, that this is no real possibility since God is not made up of parts. Furthermore, Roscelin's suggestion that God's unity may consist in an agreement in will and power between the three persons is simply folly inasmuch as this would debase the divine unity so as to be only accidental and, for this reason, secondary to the separate persons as substances (Anselm 1968: II, 16 sqq.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the realm of the divine Roscelin's line of reasoning is, according to Anselm, totally inapposite. He has no appreciation of the fact that God is not an object on a par with created objects and that He does not conform to the rules that apply to corporeal reality or to the imagination of man (Anselm 1968: II, 17–18). In accordance with this appraisal, Anselm undertakes to explain the true nature of the divine to Roscelin; for good order he also refers the reader to the fuller treatment found in the  <i class="calibre4">Monologion</i> and the  <i class="calibre4">Proslogion</i> (Anselm 1968: II, 20). Anselm focuses on God's ubiquity, eternity, and omnipotence. These attributes do not allow of multiplication, and the reason for this is that what is without limit cannot be separated from something of the same order—for example, two infinite things must be identical, or one of the two is not infinite (Anselm 1968: II, 22). The same holds true when God is seen in His proper nature as the highest good. If, for the sake of argument, it were assumed that there was more than one God, then the several gods would as the highest good be the same God; otherwise there would be something by which one god was different from another god and, consequently, both could not be the highest good. What is supremely good and perfect is by nature unique (Anselm 1968: II, 22–3). According to Anselm's appraisal, this elementary and necessary demonstration of God's unity is totally destructive of Roscelin's attempt to multiply the divine persons as divine substances. Just how much importance Anselm attached to this line of reasoning transpires from the fact that he could not resist simply repeating the argument towards the end of his treatise (Anselm 1968: II, 33–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stylistically rough composition of Anselm's treatise shows that he found it difficult to argue against an opponent whom he considered to be a theological dilettante. Of course, Anselm felt obliged to repeat the well-known distinctions from Augustine and he explained in very elementary terms and likenesses the nature of the unity of essence and Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> Trinity of persons. To him it was evident that the term ‘person’ cannot mean precisely the same when used of human persons and of divine persons. This is why it is important to focus on the similitude which justifies the use of the term for the divine persons (Anselm 1968: II, 30). As compared to the  <i class="calibre4">Monologion</i> Anselm's reply to Roscelin does not signal a significant shift in doctrine. It is true that in the latter work he saw fit to rely on Augustine's logical models of explanation, and in this respect he was presumably motivated by the circumstance that Roscelin had argued solely in terms of logic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 165) </b>In the late autumn of 1098 Anselm participated in the council at Bari where he debated the procession of the Holy Spirit with the Greek representatives (Gasper 2004). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not known how the Greeks responded to Anselm's arguments in favour of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, but four years later in the  <i class="calibre4">On the Procession of the Holy Spirit</i> Anselm restated his case (Bertola 1986). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The treatise on the procession of the Holy Spirit expands on Anselm's conception of divine simplicity and its implications for the plurality of persons. To Anselm it is incontestable that the Son and the Holy Spirit as divine persons are from the Father and that they have different modes of originating: the Son is generated by the Father and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Since the Father is God and imparts divine nature in full to the two other persons, it is, according to Anselm, of paramount importance to realize that this implies that the Son and the Holy Spirit are ‘God from God’ ( <i class="calibre4">Deus de Deo</i>), and that the Son and the Holy Spirit are one and the same God with the Father (Anselm 1968: II, 182–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As one of their main theological reasons for rejecting the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> the Greeks had argued that the procession of the Holy Spirit from both the Father and the Son entails that the third person would have two causes or principles. According to Anselm this is a patent inversion of the western position. At the very core of the Latin conception lie the absolute simplicity and unity of divine nature which determine the causality in the divine; and from this the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> follows with inexorable logic. In fact, the perfect unity and simplicity of God make it inconceivable that the third person could be from solely the Father (Anselm 1968: II, 205). Arguing for this Anselm demonstrates that the Son and the Holy Spirit cannot be separate from the Father with respect to the divine essence since the supreme simplicity and unity of the divine essence guarantee that generation and procession communicate the single divine being to the Son and the Holy Spirit, respectively. Because the Son is born from the Father as God from God and the Son is the very same divine nature as the Father it follows that the Father and the Son must be the very same principle of the procession of the Holy Spirit. Unless the Son had been split off from the divine essence, there is no manner in which the Son could be isolated or separate with respect to the communication of divine being to the Holy Spirit. This is, however, no real possibility and, as Anselm concludes, the third person in the Trinity cannot be even imagined to proceed from the Father as God from God without proceeding from the Son (Anselm 1968: II, 189). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Theology from Alcuin to Anselm</b> Somebody might claim that the Holy Spirit proceeds from that by which the Father is Father, that is to say, from the Father's relationship to the Son, and not from the Father's divine nature or essence. Anselm is willing to consider this possibility even though he finds it extremely foolish. As he sees it, even on this—unacceptable—premise it would not be possible to undermine the Latin position, since, in this case, it should be answered that the Son is not cut off from the procession of the Holy Spirit inasmuch as the relationship of being a father and the relationship of being a son imply each other and cannot be separated (Anselm 1968: II, 189–90). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anselm's defence of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> vis-à-vis the Greeks built on precisely the same conception of the absolute simplicity and unity of the divine essence which formed the basis <b class="calibre3">(p. 166) </b>for his refutation of Roscelin. Anselm was clearly aware of this and at the end of his treatise he explicitly referred the reader back to his  <i class="calibre4">Letter on the Incarnation of the</i> <i class="calibre4">Word</i>; he even recapitulated his favourite argument concerning the infinite self-identity of the divine essence and the fundamental equality of the divine persons (Anselm 1968: II, 218). With equal justification he could, in fact, have referred to the  <i class="calibre4">Monologion</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anselm's main contribution to the theology of the Trinity lies in his defence and exposition of the divine nature as that which, on the one hand, ensures that the persons are one and the same God and, on the other, sets a limit to their diversity (Anselm 1968: II, 181–</p>
<p class="calibre1">2). His efforts in this respect were of importance for the preservation and development of the legacy from Augustine and the Carolingians and it foreshadowed not only the decree </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘ <i class="calibre4">Damnamus</i>’ promulgated at the fourth Lateran Council in 1215 but also the ‘ <i class="calibre4">Sacrosancta</i> <i class="calibre4">Romana</i>’ passed at the council of Florence in 1442 (Hödl 2002). </p>
