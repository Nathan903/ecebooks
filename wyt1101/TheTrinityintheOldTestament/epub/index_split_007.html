<p class="calibre1">each with his own unique identity. This demands, doctrinally, that, while all actions of God are done as one, yet each person, nonetheless, acts in a manner that is in keeping with who he is. This is theologically important when addressing the Son's mission within the economy of salvation as the incarnate Son (as well as that of the Holy Spirit). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifth, their personal designations as ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ specify both their irreducible identities and their oneness of being. God the Father is distinct from God the Son and yet God the Father is the Father only because he eternally begets God the Son as he who is one in being with him, and God the Son is the Son only because he is eternally begotten of the Father as he who is one in being with the Father. The Father and Son are, then, ontologically and intrinsically related to one and another as the one God. This will be of the utmost significance in subsequent doctrinal development concerning the divine persons being subsistent relations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p408"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> Sixth, in employing the biblical designations of ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ the Council of Nicaea implicitly affirmed that such names are dogmatically authoritative in that they define God's immanent being. Other names or titles attributed to the Father, such as Creator, or to the Son, such as Redeemer, specify actions that are within the economy and as such these names or titles do not intrinsically define their eternal being as do the names ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ (and ‘Holy Spirit’). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, having dogmatically defined the full divinity of the Son, the Council immediately professes that the divine Son ‘for us men and for our salvation came down and became incarnate, became man, suffered and rose on the third day’ (Tanner 1990, slightly altered). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Nicene Creed, thus, intrinsically and doctrinally unites the proclamation of the Son's divinity with his incarnate humanity. Nicaea establishes, as the Council of Chalcedon (ad 451) will confirm, that the Son who is fully divine is the same Son who is fully human. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 389) </b>Having established the foundational dogmatic truths concerning the Son's existence as God and as man, we will now examine a number of theological topics that flow from these truths. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Son: A Subsistent Relation Fully in Act</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the Father and the Son are ontologically related to one another in that the Father is only the Father in relation to the Son and the Son is only the Son in relation to the Father, Aquinas, building upon the Greek Fathers and adding metaphysical depth to Augustine's understanding, conceived the persons of the Trinity as subsistent relations, that is, they subsist or exist as who they are only in relation to one another. In articulating this concept of subsistent relation, I want to offer an active role to the Holy Spirit, something Augustine, Aquinas, and the subsequent tradition did not do, for it bears upon the identity of the Son within the Trinity as well as his activity within the economy of salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Father only subsists eternally as Father by giving himself wholly as Father in the begetting of his Son. Moreover, and significantly, the Father simultaneously spirates or breathes forth the Spirit in the begetting of the Son for it is in the love of the Holy Spirit that the Father begets the Son thus conforming him to be the loving Father of the Son. It is precisely by this begetting of the Son in the love of the Holy Spirit that the Father actualizes his identity as Father. The Son subsists eternally as Son only in relation to the Father and to the Holy Spirit, for his very identity is predicated upon his being begotten of the Father in the love of the Holy Spirit who conforms him to be the loving Son of the Father. Thus, there is within the Trinity a  <i class="calibre4">spirituque</i>, in that the Son is begotten by the Father in the love of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit subsists eternally as the Holy Spirit only in relation to the Father and to the Son, for his identity as the Holy Spirit is predicated upon his coming forth from the Father as the one in whom the Father begets the Son in love and as the one in whom the Son, having been begotten in the love of the Spirit, in turn completely gives himself, in the Spirit of love, to the Father as his Son. This is ultimately the basis of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>. Not only does the Holy Spirit proceed from the Father as the one Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p409"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> in whom the Father begets the Son in love, but the Holy Spirit also proceeds from the Son as the one in whom the Son loves the Father who has begotten him. In proceeding from the Father and the Son the Holy Spirit reciprocally conforms them to love one another in the Spirit of love that he is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here we perceive the dynamic ontological nature of the persons of the Trinity being subsistent relations. Not only do the persons of the Trinity acquire their unique personal identities in relation to one another, but these relations also specify the very act that identifies who each person is. The Father is Father precisely because he is the act which begets the Son in the love of the Spirit. The Father is the act of loving paternity, fatherhood fully in act. The Son is the Son because, being begotten by the Father in the Spirit of <b class="calibre3">(p. 390) </b>love, he is the act of giving himself to the Father as Son in the Spirit of love. The Son is the act of filial love, sonship fully in act. The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as the act by which they give themselves lovingly to one another. The Holy Spirit is love fully in act. While the terms ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Holy Spirit’ are nouns, they are employed to specify the act by which each person is defined. Thus, the persons of the Trinity are not nouns; they subsist as verbs, as acts, and the names which designate them</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—designate the acts by which they subsist in relation to one another. I have emphasized this conception and articulation of the persons of the Trinity as being subsistent relations fully in act because this understanding was not adequately developed or clearly stated within either Augustine or Aquinas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relations, then, among the persons of the Trinity not only specify their singular ontological personal identity, what makes them three distinct subjects, but these relations also specify their ontological unity as the one God. As a man and a woman are mutually defined as husband and wife by their relationship, so this same relationship makes them one married couple. Similarly, the relationships that define the singular identities of the three divine persons are so the very relationships that ontologically constitute their unity. The one God is the persons of the Trinity ontologically subsisting in relationship to one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the above may appear to focus more on the Trinity as such rather than specifically on the Son, it is only in conceiving the Trinity properly that one is able to articulate clearly and accurately the person of the Son, not only within the immanent Trinity, but also his role within the economy of salvation. This will become clear in what follows. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Son as Word and Image</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Son is truly God, how are the New Testament designations ‘Word’ and ‘Image’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Father interpreted and understood? Moreover, do these names likewise bear the same dynamism as that of ‘Son’? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Aquinas, following Augustine, teaches that the two processions within God are by way of intellection (the generation of the Son) and by way of will (the spiration of the Holy Spirit). As the human intellect first conceives within itself an inner word prior to Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> speaking that word, so the Father eternally conceives the Word. Thus, the Word ‘is to be understood by way of an intelligible emanation, that is, of the intelligible word which proceeds from the speaker, yet remains in him’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.27, a.1; see also q.34, a.1). Furthermore, while human inner words do contain the truth known, no one human word embraces the truth of all possible knowledge. In contrast, the Son, being consubstantial with Father, is designated Word in that he does possess and express fully the entire truth of who the Father is. It is precisely because the Word is the full truth of the Father that this Word is designated the Son of the Father for he replicates as Son all the truth that the Father is. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 391) </b>Since the Father is fully in act as Father, the Word that emanates from within him is also fully in act, that is, the Son as Word is the Father's knowledge and truth fully in act</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the fullness of the Father's knowledge of himself and all that is and could be. It is as the dynamic Word of the Father that the Son is then the creative and life-giving bearer of all truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, because the Son, as Word, contains the entire living truth of the Father, all that the Father is, he is the perfect image of the Father. Aquinas states that the term image has to do with similitude and that the greatest similitude is to proceed ‘from another like to it in species’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.35, a.1). Human beings, for example, are of the same image, possessing the greatest similitude, for they belong to the same species. While God is not contained within a species, yet, since the Son is begotten of the Father and consubstantial with him, possessing the entire truth of the Father as Word, he is the perfect image of the Father. However, for the Son to be the image of the Father is not to be static or inert as a statue or portrait is a static and inert image of a king. Rather, the Son is the image of the Father fully in act for the Father is fully in act and so the Son perfectly reflects the fullness of the Father's life and truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Son is designated by these various names because no one name contains the totality of who the Son is. ‘To show that he is of the same nature as the Father, he is called Son; to show that he is co-eternal, he is called Splendour; to show that he is altogether like, he is called Image; to show that he is begotten immaterially, he is called the Word’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q. </p>
<p class="calibre1">34, a.2, ad3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While all of these names are proper to the being of the Son, do they have an inherent relationship to the created order? Again following Augustine, Aquinas teaches that the Word ‘implies relation to creatures. For God by knowing himself, knows every creature’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike human beings who must use multiple words to express multiple truths, ‘God by one act understands himself and all things, his one only Word is expressive not only of the Father, but of all creatures’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.34, a.3). It is precisely because the Word expresses the truth of all creatures that the Father creates through his Word (Gen. 1:3; Jn 1:3, 10; Ps. 33:6; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2). Thus the whole of creation is deemed to be good because it conforms to the truth contained within the Word and so, in some manner, bears the image of the Word (Ps. 19; Rom. 1:19–20). This is especially the case with human beings who are created in the image and likeness of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p411"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> <b class="calibre3">Being Created and Recreated in the Image and </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Likeness of the Son</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On the basis of Gen. 1:27 Aquinas teaches that human beings, as ‘intellectual creatures alone, properly speaking, are made to God's image’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.93, a.2). He further sees this image in that man's ‘intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this, that God understands and loves himself’. This imaging of God is threefold: (1) man's ‘aptitude for understand <b class="calibre3">(p. 392) </b>ing and loving God’; (2) man ‘actually and habitually knows and loves God, though imperfectly’ through ‘conformity of grace’; (3) man ‘knows and loves God perfectly’ in </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the likeness of glory’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.93, a.4). While Aquinas acknowledges that there are traces of God's image in the human body, yet strictly speaking the true image of God lies solely within man's intellect. Only in rational creatures do ‘we find a procession of the word in the intellect, and a procession of the love in the will’ which mirrors ‘an image of the uncreated Trinity’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.93, a.6). Thus, the image of the Trinity ‘is found in the acts of the soul, that is, inasmuch as from the knowledge which we possess, by actual thought we form an internal word; and thence break forth into love’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.93, a.7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Aquinas teaches is insightful, yet I want to argue, in keeping with the Patristic tradition exemplified in Irenaeus ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. V,6,1) and Athanasius of Alexandria ( <i class="calibre4">Contra Gentes</i> 2,2), that human beings are created in the image and likeness of the God in that they are created in the image and likeness of the Son. The Father creates through the Son and, in creating man in his own image, the Father creates him in the likeness of the Son, for the Son is his perfect image and likeness. To be created in the image of the Son means that the Father intended that human beings, like the Son, would be able to know and live the truth and so reflect the Son as Word of the Father. So, as Aquinas stated above, human beings have the natural aptitude for knowing and loving God as well as other human persons and all else that is good, but now this is specifically so because they are modelled after the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this juncture I want to argue, contrary to Augustine and Aquinas, and the received Christian theological tradition, that it is not only man's intellectual ability (his soul) that bears the image of God, but rather the whole of who he is as a human being. The Son is the perfect image of the Father for, as Son, he is fully in act as the Father is fully in act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For human beings to be the image of the Son demands that they be fully in act as well, but human beings are only fully in act when both their souls and bodies are fully in act and not simply their intellects and wills. The human act of intellection requires that the bodily senses and brain as well as the immaterial intellect be in act. Moreover, human beings can only speak the truth and act lovingly upon the truth through bodily spoken words and by bodily human actions—bodily actions of love, justice, courage, etc. Thus, the whole human person, body and soul, is in the likeness of the Son, for only when the whole human person is fully in act does he or she properly reflect the image of the Son who is fully in act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p412"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> Now, in the light of sin which disfigured the image of the Son within human beings by undermining their ability to know and love the truth as does the Son, especially in knowing and loving God, the Father sent his Son into the world as man in order to recreate human beings in his image, that is, in the Son who is his perfect image. Does this imply that only the Son could have become man and as man recreate human beings in his image? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We observed previously that Aquinas held that the Son as Word implies a relationship to creation in that the Father knows himself and all else through the Word. Nonetheless, Aquinas argued that, while it is most fitting for the Son to become man, any one of the three divine persons could have become incarnate ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.5). However, I want to argue, again in keeping with Irenaeus ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. III,23,1 and V,16,1) and Athanasius ( <i class="calibre4">De Incarnatione</i> 13,7 and 9,14.2), that it was right and proper that only the Son could become man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 393) </b>Karl Rahner, in arguing that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, that is, the manner in which the Trinity reveals itself within the economy of salvation is the manner in which it actually exists in itself, gives as his primary example the incarnation of the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In one way this statement [the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity] is a defined doctrine of the faith. Jesus is not simply God in general, but the Son. The second divine person, God's Logos, is man, and only he is man. Hence there is a least  <i class="calibre4">one</i> ‘mission,’  <i class="calibre4">one</i> presence in the world,  <i class="calibre4">one</i> reality of salvation history which is not merely appropriated to some divine person, but which is proper to him. (Rahner 1970: 23)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Long before Rahner articulated his now famous axiom, the Fathers of the Church as well as the Scholastics always argued that God revealed himself to be a Trinity of persons through the specific individual missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit. These missions within the economy provide a window through which the immanent Trinity can be properly discerned. The fact that only the Son could become man is significant, then, not only for the sake of obtaining a proper understanding of the Son within the Trinity and his salvific work within the economy, but also of conceiving and articulating a proper understanding of the Father and the Holy Spirit—both as they too exist within the Trinity and act within the economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas gives as an objection to the premise that any one of the divine persons other than the Son could have become man that such an actuality ‘would tend to confusion of the divine persons’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.5, objection 1). He should have taken this objection more seriously, for this objection is crucial for obtaining not only a proper understanding of the Trinity but also of the Son. If the Father or the Holy Spirit became man, not only would this not be in keeping with who they are as divine persons, but it would undermine the very identity of the Son as Word and Image of the Father. Moreover, it would render unintelligible the fact that the work of redemption was precisely that of recreating human beings in the likeness of the Son. For any person other than the Son to become man would destroy the ontological order within the Trinity, that is, that the Father is Father precisely Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p413"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> because he begets the Son in his Spirit of love as his singular Word of truth and perfect Image. Equally, the work of redemption would not truly reveal the Trinity as the Trinity is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is ultimately how Aquinas argues when he taught that it is ‘more fitting’ for the Son to become man rather than the Father or the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas first argues that the Son, as Word of the Father, possesses an inherent affinity with the created order since as Word he contains, as exemplar, the whole of the created order. Thus, it would only be proper that the one through whom the universe was created and in whom the created order finds its exemplar be the one who restores creation—freeing it from evil and making it new ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.8). ‘The first creation of things was made by the power of God the Father through the Word; hence the second creation ought to have been brought about through the Word, by the power of God the Father, in order that the restoration should correspond to creation’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.8, ad2). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 394) </b>Second, Aquinas provides two further arguments, both pertaining to human beings, as to why it is proper for the Son, specifically as Word of the Father, to become man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Word has ‘a particular agreement with human nature’ in that the Word embraces the fullness of divine Wisdom. Since human beings are perfected through the obtaining of such wisdom, it is only proper and fitting that such wisdom be obtained through the Word incarnate, the fount of all wisdom. Moreover, since sin entered the world through a misconceived desire to obtain knowledge and since this was precipitated through the lies of Satan, ‘it is only fitting that by the Word of true knowledge man might be led back to God, having wandered from God through an inordinate thirst for knowledge’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it would seem more than fitting that the Son, as Word of the Father, should, as man, be the bearer of wisdom and truth since, ontologically within the Trinity, he is the divine person whose very divine identity, who he is as a divine person, is defined as the Word of wisdom and truth. While the Father begets his Son as the Word and Wisdom of truth and while the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth in that the Spirit fosters and confirms the truth of the Word within believers, yet only the Son, as Word, bears the wisdom and truth of the Father that the Spirit will engender and affirm within believers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, Aquinas argues that since the end of human beings is to be adopted children of the Father, so ‘it was fitting that by him who is the natural Son, men should share this likeness of sonship by adoption’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.8). This is the heart of the issue. It would appear that obtaining such sonship through and in the Father or the Holy Spirit would not only be inappropriate but also ontologically impossible given that only the divine Son is ontologically the Son of the Father and thus only he could obtain humankind's adopted sonship. As the Father created man through his Son and in the image of his Son, so the Father recreates man in the image of his Son through the salvific work of his Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given that only the Son is able to become man, how did the Son as man restore human beings to the wisdom and truth of the Father and recreate them in his divine image so that, in him and through the Holy Spirit, they become adopted children of the Father? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p414"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> <b class="calibre3">The Salvific Work of the Son Incarnate</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Father eternally begets his Son in the love of the Spirit, so the Father in time sent his Son into the world and he becomes incarnate, Son of God as man, of the virgin Mary by that same power and love of the Holy Spirit. The Son, in whose image man was first created, assumed his own image so as to restore and elevate that image to his own divine likeness. However, the image that the Son assumed in becoming man was the sin-scarred humanity of the fallen race of Adam. He is a son of Adam born in the likeness of sinful flesh (Lk. 3:38; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21). Only by assuming humankind's fallen humanity could he, within that humanity, recreate it and make it new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In becoming one with humankind, the Son, as the divine Word, revealed as man the truth of his Father as well as providing the wisdom to live an authentic human life. Thus, <b class="calibre3">(p. 395) </b>in accordance with the Council of Chalcedon (ad 451), which professed that the Son of God actually existed as man, the manner in which he taught was as man. To hear the human voice of Jesus was, literally, to hear the human voice of the Son—the word of the Word. Moreover, the actions that Jesus performed, whether they were the routine human actions of eating, walking, sleeping, etc., or the divine actions of healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out demons, or other miracles, all such actions were done by the Son in a human manner. These latter actions are termed theandric actions—divine acts done humanly for the divine Son performed them as man. As the Son revealed his divine identity through his human words, so he equally revealed his divine identity through his human actions. Thus, in the Incarnation, the Son actively interrelated and was personally engaged, on an equal human level, with other human beings and with his environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The singular difference was, for example, that when Jesus touched someone or when someone touched him, who was doing the human touching and who was being humanly touched was none other than the eternal divine Son equal to the Father. What is significant here is that the healing, restoration, and elevation of humankind was accomplished by the divine Son, not in a divine manner, but in a human manner for the Son of God existed and acted as man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From a Trinitarian perspective, it must also be acknowledged that, while the Son as man taught, healed, etc., he did so through the power of the Holy Spirit who dwelt within his humanity. This follows the established Trinitarian paradigm. The Father begets the Son in the love of the Spirit who conforms him to be the loving Son of the Father. Moreover, the Son of the Father is conceived in the womb of Mary through the same Spirit in whom he was eternally begotten. Similarly, at Jesus’ baptism the Father declares, in the descent of the Holy Spirit, that this truly is his Son. The overshadowing of the Holy Spirit manifested that the incarnate Son is indeed the loving Son of the Father on earth and that, as the loving Son existing as man, he will now lovingly, in the Holy Spirit, teach and restore humankind. The interior life of the immanent Trinity is now played out on earth through the visible, historical life of Jesus, the Son of God incarnate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p415"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> Ultimately, it was through his life of obedience to the Father that, as a member of the fallen race of Adam, the Son brought about humankind's salvation. As the Son was eternally the loyal and faithful Son of the Father in the love of the Holy Spirit so, now, as man the Son is the obedient Son, in the love of the Holy Spirit, and in so doing he reverses the disobedience of Adam and his posterity (Rom. 5:12–21). While the Son's whole earthly life was marked by obedience, this obedience finds its culmination in the cross (Phil. 2:8). The cross becomes the definitive revelation that Jesus is truly the faithful and loyal Son of the Father begotten by him in the love of the Spirit (Mk 15:39; Jn 8:28). Moreover, it is in this definitive revelation that the Son also humanly achieved humankind's salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus’ death on the cross contains many facets. First, his sacrificial death was a twofold act of love. It was an act of filial obedient sacrificial love offered to the Father, for, in the love of the Spirit, the Son freely offered his own human life to the Father to atone for and so offset or, literally, counteract, all humankind's ungodly sinful acts. Moreover, it was an act of sacrificial love performed out of love for humankind, for the incarnate Son did, out of love for those who had been created in his own image, what they could not do on <b class="calibre3">(p. 396) </b>their own behalf having been rendered spiritually impotent due to sin. It was this human twofold act of free sacrificial love, rendered in the Spirit, which made the Son's sacrifice meritorious and efficacious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, in offering himself out of love for humankind, the incarnate Son freely offered a sinless, perfect, and holy sacrifice to the Father, one that would fully and adequately express humankind's reparational or atoning love in the face of sin, thus reconciling humankind to the Father. It is in the Son's human blood, suffused with the love and holiness of the Spirit, that this perfect, all-loving, sinless, and all-holy sacrifice established the new and everlasting covenant with the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third, as evident from the above, while it was truly the person of the Son who offered the sacrifice, he did so, in accordance with the truth of the Incarnation, as man. The merit of the sacrifice, which expiated humankind's guilt and condemnation thus reconciling it to the Father, was precisely located in the Son's human love for the Father and for the whole of humankind—again, a love born of the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourth, while Jesus experienced our condemnation on the cross, yet, in the very same act of assuming our condemnation, he simultaneously and equally offered in love his human life to the Father as an atoning sacrifice on humankind's behalf. The Son's loving sacrificial offering of his life to the Father on humankind's behalf transformed the suffering of humankind's condemnation into an act of freeing humankind from such condemnation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifth, on the cross the Son of God put to death humankind's sinful humanity. Because the Son of God lived a pure and holy life of obedience to the Father as a member of the sinful race of Adam, within his own sin-marred humanity, the loving offering of that humanity on the cross brought about its demise. Our sinful human nature was put to death for the Son transformed it into a pure, holy, and loving sacrifice to the Father on behalf of all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> The drama of the cross, then, mirrors the life within the Trinity. The Father eternally begets his Son in the Spirit of love and the Son, in the same Spirit of love, loves the Father. On earth, as man, in the Spirit of love, the Son, by his filial obedience to the Father, offered his human life to the Father on behalf of humankind. As the Father is eternally pleased with his Son so now he is equally pleased with his Son on earth, and as the Father eternally begot the Son in the love of the Spirit so now he exalts his Son, in the Spirit of love, as the risen and glorious Son incarnate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Resurrected Incarnate Son</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The bodily resurrection of Jesus is of the utmost significance both for himself and for the whole of humankind. First, as pertains to Jesus himself, by raising him from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit, the Father confirmed that he was indeed his eternal Son. If the Father had not raised him from the dead, it would have corroborated the accusations levelled against him that he had falsely made himself out to be the Son of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 397) </b>Second, in the resurrection the Father validated and manifested the efficacy of his Son's sacrifice on the cross. Actually, the resurrection is the direct fruit of the cross, and the Father ensured that Jesus, his Son, was the first to experience the inherent worth of his own salvific work. Thus, the Son of God, who had assumed in the Incarnation humankind's fallen nature, the sin-marred image of himself, now, in the resurrection, is the first, through the Holy Spirit, to assume the restored and recreated image of himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Son, who as God is the perfect image of the Father, and in whose image man was first created, now bears the perfect likeness of himself, and so of the Father, as a risen man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Son is now the perfect image of the Perfect Image. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, as the risen Lord and Saviour, the glorious incarnate Son rightly possesses the authority to send forth the new life of the Holy Spirit, the divine endowment of his sacrificial death. Through this Spirit humankind can once more be recreated in the Son's own divine image and likeness. Thus, Jesus became, as the risen incarnate Son, the new Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the father of a new human race (Rom. 5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A New Creation in Christ</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">How, then, do human beings appropriate the saving work of Jesus and so be recreated in his divine image? First, by dying and rising with Christ. The Son of God assumed the fallen nature of Adam, his own sin-marred image, and through his death and resurrection acquired a new glorious humanity, the perfect image of his own image. Through faith and baptism, Christians, likewise, shed their fallen humanity and become a new creation in him sharing in his new risen humanity (Rom. 6:1–11; 2 Cor. 5:17). Humankind's fallen humanity is not only restored in Christ, but it is also elevated to share in the divine risen image—the image that it was to possess from the foundation of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> Second, because Christians are a new creation in Christ, they are freed from sin and its condemnation. As they were in the bondage of Adam's sin, bearing his enslaved image, so now Christians share in the freedom of the children of the new Adam, bearing his unfettered image. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third, more positively, Christians, through the Holy Spirit, are made righteous and holy sharing in the righteousness and holiness of the risen Son. No longer do Christians do the deeds of the flesh after the manner of the old Adam, but they now do the deeds of the Spirit after the manner of the new Adam (Rom. 8). These virtuous deeds of the Spirit are not merely mental deeds, but rather they are done bodily—done by entire Spirit-filled persons. Thus Jesus, as the Son incarnate, performed his holy human salvific deeds through power of the Spirit to the glory of his Father, so now Christians, recreated in the Spirit, reflect his image through their holy deeds and so too glorify the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourth, having been recreated in the likeness of the Son, Christians, as adopted children, share in a new intimacy with the Father after the manner of Jesus, the Son. This transformation once again follows the Trinitarian paradigm and so corroborates the necessity for the Son to be the incarnate means of humankind's salvation. The Father  <b class="calibre3">(p. 398) </b>eternally begets his Son in the Spirit so that, in that Spirit, the Father and Son eternally love one another. Likewise, the Holy Spirit transforms Christians into the likeness of Jesus the Son so that they too can experience the love of the Father through the same Spirit and in turn love the Father in their newly acquired Spirit of sonship. In Christ, through the Spirit, Christians possess a new kind of relationship with the Father, that is, being his adopted children, a relationship that those who are not Christian do not share. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifth, not only do Christians, as his children, possess a unique relationship with the Father, they equally possess, as brothers and sisters in Christ, a unique relationship with one another, a relationship that they do not share with those who are not Christians, for they become one in him through the bond and love of the Spirit. By sharing in the common life of the Spirit, Christians become members of the living body of Christ, the Church, of which he is the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sixth, in the light of becoming a new creation in Christ through the indwelling Spirit, Christians live in anticipation both of Jesus’ return in glory and of their own bodily resurrection. At present Christians and the whole of creation are groaning to share in the fullness of Jesus’ divine Sonship (Rom. 8:18–25). Yet, it is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that dwells within them, who is the guarantee and first down payment assuring Christians that they will indeed assume fully the divine likeness of the risen incarnate Son (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:14 and 4:30). At the coming of the Son of God, bearing his glorious humanity, every Christian will rejoice in the Spirit. This gladness is not simply because of their own resurrection, but in participating and witnessing the supreme event of all history when every knee will bend and every tongue proclaim, to the glory of God the Father, that Jesus, the incarnate Son, is indeed Lord of heaven and earth (Phil. 2:11). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 12 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Christology: The Eternal Son</b> All of the above has been predicated on one truth that may have already become obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This truth finds its origin within the Trinity itself. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit share their one common life because they are all ontologically united to one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians come to share the very life of the Trinity because they are in the Holy Spirit united to Jesus, the Son, and so become children of the Father. This personal relationship with Jesus, the Son, both on earth and in heaven gives Christians access to and allows them to live within the very life of the Trinity itself. This radically makes Christianity distinct from all other religions (excepting Judaism) where the religious founder merely imparts ‘saving’ knowledge that is to be followed by his adherents. Within Christianity, it is the person of the Son, who took on our flesh, who is himself of the utmost importance, for in order to share in the fruit of his redemption—forgiveness of sins and the new life in the Spirit—one must be personally united to him. At the end of time all of the just will be one in Jesus, the incarnate Son, and so share fully in the life of the Holy Spirit and the love of the Father (Eph. 1:10). </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article presents commentaries on Trinitarian pneumatology. It explains that scriptural teachings about the Holy Spirit suggest that a Trinitarian theology of the Spirit faces two primary tasks: an account of the Spirit's mysterious personal being, and of his immediate personal action. It emphasizes that a Trinitarian pneumatology treats primarily the identity of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit's distinctive work in creation and redemption. It discusses the relevant views of Thomas Aquinas who found the identity of the Spirit in his relation of origin to the Father and Son, and John Duns Scotus who found the Spirit's identity in his unique way of originating from the Father. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instructing the Corinthians, St Paul teaches that though the world holds it in contempt, the word of the cross is in reality the supreme wisdom, because it has been revealed by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit alone can teach the wisdom of God, which exceeds beyond measure ‘what eye has seen or ear has heard’, because the Spirit ‘searches everything, even the deep things of God’ (1 Cor. 2:9–10). With the Holy Spirit is bound up the most intimate mystery of God, the interior depths utterly closed to even the highest creaturely wisdom. Yet these secret and hidden recesses of God himself (1 Cor. 2:7) have been opened up to us, by the very Spirit who searches them. ‘We have received … the Spirit which is from God, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God’ (1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2:12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This teaching of the apostle indicates that in our present condition, living between Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">ascension to the Father and his return in glory, the Holy Spirit is the most mysterious of the persons of the Trinity, and yet the one with whom we have the most immediate contact. Only by intimacy with the Holy Spirit are we given access to Jesus the Son, and in the Son to the depths of the Father. Yet the Spirit is self-effacing, even elusive. It is the Holy Spirit who works directly upon us to unite us with Jesus Christ and his Father, but the Spirit does this by teaching us to know who Jesus is, and not to know who he is. Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p421"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> own teaching about the Holy Spirit highlights this intersection of intimacy and mystery, availability and unfathomable depth. Jesus promises his disciples the Holy Spirit as their ever-present comforter and advocate, who will be with them forever once Jesus goes to the Father. The world will not know or receive this promised Spirit, he tells them, but ‘you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you’ (Jn 14:17). Yet the Spirit, Jesus continues, ‘will bear witness to me’, and not to himself (Jn 15:26), ‘he will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you’ (Jn 16:14). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 401) </b>These basic scriptural teachings about the Holy Spirit suggest that a Trinitarian theology of the Spirit faces two primary tasks. We need an account of the Spirit's mysterious personal being, and of his immediate personal action. Differently put, Trinitarian pneumatology has to get a fix on the Spirit's  <i class="calibre4">identity</i>, on who the Spirit is, especially as his own identity distinguishes him from, and relates him to, the Father and the Son. And it will have to grasp the essential features of the Spirit's  <i class="calibre4">work</i>, of his distinctive place in the creation, redemption, and final perfection of all things by the triune God. Here we will focus on the Spirit's identity, limiting our consideration of the Spirit's work to his personal indwelling, promised by Jesus to those whom he has called out of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Identity of the Spirit</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The identity of a person consists in whatever is most necessary for him to be an irreducible individual—in classical terms, a hypostasis. Thus a person's identity is also what distinguishes him from other persons in the most basic way, and  <i class="calibre4">a fortiori</i> from individuals or hypostases which are not persons. What makes for personal identity remains a matter of philosophical dispute. When it comes to the identity of divine persons, however, the intense debates of the fourth century had already led Trinitarian theologians to some very basic conclusions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, it became clear by the end of this period that as the Son and the Holy Spirit are not creatures, but are true God just as the Father is, so also their identities cannot be contingent. The one God is not contingently Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Rather these three persons or hypostases just are the one God, and the one God just is each of these three persons, and all three together (thus, e.g. Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>, V.8.9 (Augustine 1991: 195)). Whatever belongs to the identity of each person therefore belongs necessarily to the one God. The identity of each of the three persons can no more be contingent then can God himself, or the divine essence fully possessed by each person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From this it follows, crucially, that no action of the divine persons in the entire sphere of creation and redemption can be constitutive of the identity of any one of them. Or, as it is sometimes put, no action of the three persons  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>, no action terminating in an effect which is itself not divine but created, can belong to the identity of a divine person. The reason is straightforward. The entire sphere of creation and redemption, as a whole and in all of its parts, is contingent. It is the free action of the triune God, and as such could be other than it is, or could never have existed at all. But who and what the triune God is, the identity of the three as distinct persons and as God, is not contingent, but can be only Page 2 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p422"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> as it actually is. Since the divine persons have their identities necessarily, and the works of the persons  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> are all contingent, no such work can enter into the identity of a divine person, making that person who he unalterably is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ancient distinction between  <i class="calibre4">theologia</i> and  <i class="calibre4">oikonomia</i> enshrines this basic difference between who the triune God is and what the triune God does, between necessary identity and contingent action (see, e.g. St Gregory Nazianzen,  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.18; 31.3  <b class="calibre3">(p. 402)</b> (Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 86, 118); St John of Damascus,  <i class="calibre4">De fide orthodoxa</i> I.2; III.1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(John of Damascus 1958: 166–7, 267–9)). The economy of the triune God, his saving stewardship of his creation, makes  <i class="calibre4">known</i> to us the truths of  <i class="calibre4">theologia</i>, including the unchanging identity of each divine person, but the revealing economy does not make any person to  <i class="calibre4">be</i> the one he necessarily is. In this the identity of the divine persons clearly differs from that of human persons. Human identity is contingent, and as such is shaped, perhaps quite deeply, by free actions. Deciding to prosecute a war against the Confederate states, we are inclined to say, is not simply a free action Abraham Lincoln took (though it is that), but a deed that formed his identity, helping to make him who he was. In Trinitarian pneumatology, by contrast, the work of the Holy Spirit, while it may be the Spirit's way of teaching us who he is, cannot enter into his identity itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, the fourth-century debates brought to light that when it comes to the identity of persons in God, origin and relation must be basic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Son and the Holy Spirit are not creatures, any more than the Father is, the resources for understanding what it is to be the Father, the Son, or the Spirit are limited to what can rightly be said of God, and said in a way which captures the distinction of the persons without making them more than one God. Not only overt personal action, but various other elements which seem important to personal identity among human beings, cannot apply to identity in God. I am a person irreducibly distinct from my father at least in part because my flesh and bones are discrete from his. My body is one, his another, we count them as two, as numerically distinct from one another. But in God there is no matter, so we cannot say one divine person differs from another by being linked to a different chunk of matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With my body goes, we are apt to say, a unique soul, or perhaps a unique subjectivity or stream of conscious events. This soul, subject, or consciousness is different from my father's, and is fundamental to making me a person distinct from him. We rightly count discrete souls, however, not only as multiple persons, but as multiple human beings. But there are not multiple gods, so the identity and distinction of persons in God—for the moment, that of the Holy Spirit in particular—cannot be quite like that of different souls or streams of consciousness. It must somehow consist simply in the origination of one divine person from another, and in the resulting relation of one to another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To creatures belong countless relations that do not involve origination, but in God the two are mutually implicative: not only do specific relations result when one person originates from another, but all relations among the persons are tied to the way in which they originate. With the Father's generation of the Son go two relations, paternity or fatherhood Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p423"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> and filiation or sonship. To be the subject of one of these relations is necessarily to be the term of the other (they are what scholastic theology would later call ‘opposed’ relations; see below). The Father is the subject and the Son the term of paternity, while the Son is the subject and the Father the term of filiation. These relations are basic to the identity of the Father and the Son respectively, that is, to the person who is the subject of each. By the same token they serve to distinguish the Father and the Son irreducibly. Since he is related to the Father by filiation, the Son cannot possess the relation of paternity to the Father, and so he cannot  <i class="calibre4">be</i> the Father. Other relations between the two, such  <b class="calibre3">(p. 403) </b>as their love for one another, not only presuppose the relations and personal distinctions arising directly from the Father's generation of the Son, but are possessed by each in a fashion determined by the basic relations of origin. Thus the Father's love for the Son is irreducibly paternal, and the Son's love for the Father is irreducibly filial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the unique characteristics of the Father, of course, is not only his relationship of paternity to the Son, but the property of having no origin, of being unoriginate (more precisely, in scholastic terms,  <i class="calibre4">innascibilis</i>—not  <i class="calibre4">possibly</i> originate or generated). Similarly a unique mode of origin distinguishes the Son from the Father. The Son exists as generated, or as originated by way of generation. By the time of the Cappadocians and Augustine, the personal identity of the Father and the Son was thought of both in terms of the irreducible relations of one to the other and in terms of the unique mode of origin belonging to each (with the Father's mode of origin precisely that of being from no other). At this stage these two ways of thinking about personal identity in God were used more or less interchangeably. St Gregory Nazianzen influentially says, for example, that ‘ “Father” </p>
<p class="calibre1">… designates the relation and manner of being the Father has with respect to the Son’ ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.16 (Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 84; translation altered)), suggesting that paternity is at the root of the Father's personal identity. At the same time he regularly indicates that being ‘unoriginate’ or ‘without source’ is the fundamental distinguishing characteristic of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 30.19; 31.9 (Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 109, 123)), suggesting that a distinctive mode of origin (that of having none) is at the root of the Father's identity ( <i class="calibre4">cf. Oration</i> 25.16, which combines both ideas). </p>
<p class="calibre1">How may we apply these principles, hard-won in reflection on the  <i class="calibre4">homoousia</i> of the Son with the Father, to the Holy Spirit? One clear scriptural teaching anchors reflection on this question. The Holy Spirit whom Jesus promises to send is, he says, ‘the one who proceeds from the Father’ (Jn 15:26: Æ paq¹ to¤ patq½r ©jpoqe≤etai). The Creed of 381 follows this language closely, describing the Holy Spirit as t½ ©j to¤ patq½r ©jpoqeuÖlemom (Tanner 1990: vol. 1, 24). ‘Proceeding’ or ‘procession’ presumably names a distinct mode of origin, a unique relation arising from origin, or both. If so, grasping this type of origination or this relation will give us what is basic to the identity of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Augustine observes, however, understanding the Spirit's procession, and distinguishing it from the generation of the Son, is no small question ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V.14.15 (Augustine 1991: 199)). The Son is true God because he receives the one divine nature from the Father. If the Holy Spirit is also true God, as the Son is, then he too must receive the divine nature from the Father, as the Son does. No created reality provides us with an ade</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p424"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> quate analogy for the timeless coming forth of the Son and the Holy Spirit from the Father in the innermost depths of God. The best conceptual tool we have, feeble though it is, for grasping the Father's communication of his nature to another divine person is evidently animal (and especially human) generation. As we know, certain kinds of creatures impart their own nature to a new creature, their offspring. This process of generation among creatures fits with the eternal begetting of the Son by the Father, and helps us understand to some extent how God the Son can receive the divine nature from the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Creatures, though, have only a single way of communicating their own nature from one individual to another, namely the form of generation or reproduction which belongs <b class="calibre3">(p. 404) </b>to that nature. When we apply this creaturely analogue to the inner-divine origination of the Son and the Spirit from the Father, generation as we know it from creatures has been pre-empted, as it were, by the person of the Son. Our best creaturely analogy thus leaves us puzzled as to how we should understand the Spirit's procession from the Father, the Spirit's own way of receiving the divine nature. If the Spirit's procession is also an act of generation or begetting by the Father, then, as opponents of the Spirit's divinity in the fourth century derisively observed, the Holy Spirit will be the Son's brother, or perhaps the Father's grandson. Evidently the Spirit's procession must simply be a different kind of origination from the Son's begetting, an irreducibly different way in which the Father imparts his own nature to another. But what would this be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here Trinitarian pneumatology persistently senses the mystery of the Spirit. Theological attempts to search out what exactly distinguishes the Spirit's procession from the Son's generation are, accordingly, sometimes met with considerable apophatic reserve. God is not a creature, and so, unlike creatures, can surely have more than one way to impart his nature to another person. More than this we need not know. This view was common among the Greek Fathers, as John of Damascus explains: ‘We have learned that there is a difference between begetting and procession, but what the manner of this difference is we have not learned at all’ ( <i class="calibre4">De fide orthodoxa</i> I.8 (John of Damascus 1958: 184; cf. 181); <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Gregory Nazianzen,  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 31.8 (Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 122)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The deep things of God are indeed inaccessible to us apart from the gift of the Spirit himself, but at the same time we have received the Spirit ‘who searches everything … that we might understand’ what would otherwise be wholly beyond us (1 Cor. 2:9, 12). Seized by both sides of Paul's teaching on this subject, Trinitarian pneumatology has often been unwilling to halt at a purely negative statement about the distinctive character of the Spirit's procession (that it is not generation). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following some scriptural indications (e.g. Jn 4:10 and Jn 7:37–9; Acts 8:20; Rom. 5:5), St Augustine already proposes that the Holy Spirit comes forth from the Father ‘not in the manner of one born, but in the manner of one given’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V.14.15;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. XV.19.33–6 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Augustine 1991: 199, 421–6)). ‘Being given’, this suggests, is a way of receiving the divine nature discrete from ‘being born’, and thus points to a positive way we might distinguish the Spirit's manner of originating from the Father (procession) from the Son's (generation). If the Spirit is perfect gift from perfect giver, it makes sense to go a bit further, Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p425"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> and think of the Spirit as ‘a certain unutterable communion of the Father and the Son’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V.11.12 (Augustine 1991: 197)), or as the one who originates in God as the sole fully adequate pledge or expression of the love of the Father and the Son for one another, ‘the outpouring of their mutual love’ (Scheeben 1946: 107). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This suggests, moreover, that the Spirit has love as a property marking his personal distinction from the Father and the Son. Originating precisely as the fruit or seal of the love of the Father and the Son for one another, the Spirit in some deep sense seems to be, as person, love, and therefore himself to be, in his very distinction from the two, the mutual love or communion of the Father and the Son (see Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> VI.5.7; XV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">17.27–XV.18.32 (Augustine 1991: 209–10, 418–21)). Augustine's scriptural intuitions here generate much subsequent reflection over how to understand ‘love’ and ‘gift’ as unique <b class="calibre3">(p. 405) </b>characteristics of the Holy Spirit, yet without supposing that the Father and the Son receive the capacity to love and to give from the Spirit. Since both come forth from the unoriginate Father, the Son and the Spirit can have no capacity, as they can have no nature, which they do not receive from the Father (Marshall 2004b). ‘Love’ (and in a different way ‘gift’) must therefore be, in some manner, both common to the three persons <i class="calibre4">and</i> unique to the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding the Spirit as the one who comes forth as gift and love in person gives some purchase on what is distinctive about the Spirit's procession, and to that extent on the Spirit's unique personal identity. The Son cannot originate as the fruit of his own love for the Father, or as the pledge of the Father's love to him; only a third person can originate in this way. And this distinctive feature of the Spirit's identity, that only he originates as gift, helps explain why the Spirit alone, among the persons of the Trinity, is spoken of in Scripture as ‘gift’, just as the Son alone is spoken of as ‘word’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> XV.17.29 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Augustine 1991: 419)). Among the three only he is spoken of as ‘gift’ to  <i class="calibre4">us</i> because to him alone does it personally belong to  <i class="calibre4">be</i> gift. Similarly the Spirit's origination as love helps explain the special association in the New Testament between love in God and the indwelling person of the Spirit (e.g. Rom. 5:5; 1 Jn 4:7–16). Only his eternal origination as gift and love, in other words, is enough to ground his scripturally described temporal mission as gift of the Father and the Son to creatures, and as their love for creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">The</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Filioque</b></i> <b class="calibre3">and the Identity of the Spirit</b> The long and still unresolved conflict about the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, despite its many unhappy consequences, has yielded considerable further insight into the personal identity of the Spirit—</p>
<p class="calibre1">or, at least, into the precise shape of the question and the ramifications of the different answers one might give. The  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> is not, as is often supposed, simply a matter of disagreement between East and West. The Spirit's procession was the subject of intense debate within the medieval West itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At issue in this discussion was not the bare fact of the matter. All in the medieval West were agreed that the addition of ‘and the Son’ to the Creedal confession of the Spirit's procession was correct and legitimate, and thus that the procession of the Holy Spirit Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> from the Father and the Son was authoritative Christian teaching. So St Bonaventure observes, in response to objections from the East, that by adding the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> ‘we have not corrupted [the Creed], rather we have completed it’ ( <i class="calibre4">In I Sent</i>., dist. 11, a.1, q.1, corp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Bonaventure 1882: 212b)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The issue, rather, was whether the Holy Spirit would still be a person distinct from the Son—would still have his unique personal identity—even if he did not proceed from the Son. There are only two possibilities: <b class="calibre3">(p. 406)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(A)</b> If not, then the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> is not only true, but required by faith in the Trinity. To deny the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> would then, at least by implication, be to deny the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(B)</b> If so, then the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, while true, is not necessary for faith in the Trinity, and those who deny the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> (the Christian East, as the medieval West well knew) do not thereby deny the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(To be sure, eastern theology, especially in the last century or so, has often suggested that <i class="calibre4">affirming</i> the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> denies the Trinity, but this claim is not usually based on any clear understanding of what the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> means and entails; see Marshall 2004b.) Reflecting extensively on this question, medieval scholastic theologians clearly saw that relying on the ideas of relation and origin in order to grasp the three distinct persons in God is more difficult than had once been supposed. Both ideas are necessary, but they cannot be used interchangeably. And it makes a great deal of difference which one is truly basic, and has priority over the other (see especially Friedman 2010). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">St Thomas: The Identity of the Spirit Requires Opposed Relations</b> <b class="calibre3">and the</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Filioque</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Aquinas is the most influential advocate of the view that relation has priority over mode of origination in making each of the divine three a unique person, distinct from the other two—in particular the Holy Spirit. His main source for this idea is Augustine, who regularly says that we must distinguish strictly between what is said of God by way of substance and what is said by way of relation; only relation, not substance, makes for personal distinction in God (e.g.  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V.5.6; V.11.12 (Augustine 1991: 192, 197)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas, however, develops the Trinitarian application of the concept of relation well beyond what Augustine had done, arguing that the divine persons are ‘subsistent relations’ (see Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.29, a.4,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.; q.30, a.2,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.; q.39, a.1,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.; Marshall 2007). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aquinas holds, more exactly, that each of the persons in God can have his unique personal identity, and be distinct from the other two, only on account of an ‘opposed’ relation. Relations, as we have seen, are ‘opposed’ when it is impossible for the same individual to possess both of them. Between any two individuals, for example, fatherhood and sonship are opposed. If Albert has the relation of fatherhood to Boniface, then Boniface has the relation of sonship to Albert. Each is thereby the subject of a relation the other cannot Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> possess to him. Albert cannot be son to Boniface, or Boniface father to Albert. Albert and Boniface must, therefore, be distinct individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In just this way, Aquinas argues, the three divine persons are unique individuals, distinct from each other. We know this most clearly by looking at the person of the Father. As the Creed indicates, the Father is the subject of two different relations within the unity of the divine nature: the relation of paternity to the Son, and the relation of spiration (literally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘breathing’) or active procession to the Holy Spirit (see Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.27, <b class="calibre3">(p. 407) </b>a.4, ad3; q.28, a.4,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.). These relations are irreducibly different from one another (or ‘disparate’, as the scholastics liked to say), and indicate different modes of production or emanation, but they are not  <i class="calibre4">opposed</i> to each other. The relation opposed to paternity is not spiration, but filiation; the relation opposed to spiration or active procession is not paternity, but passive procession. Just because the relations are not opposed, one and the same person—the Father—can be the subject of both, and as such the source of both the Son and the Spirit. If merely disparate relations were sufficient to distinguish persons, then the Father, since he is the subject of two different relations, would be two different persons. It is basic to the faith, of course, that the Father is one. And so we know that opposed relations are required to distinguish the divine persons from one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This has important consequences for the way we understand the personal identity of the Holy Spirit. In general, opposed relations can arise in only two ways: from quantity (A is greater than B; B is less than A) or from action (A moves B; B is moved by A). Since there can be no quantitative oppositions among the divine persons, opposed relations in God can only be relations of origin, and on these relations the real distinction of persons depends (see  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i>, Bk. IV, ch. 24, §7 (Thomas Aquinas 1975: 136–7)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus the Son is a person distinct from the Father by having a relation of origin to the Father (filiation), opposed to the Father's originating relation to him (paternity), and the Holy Spirit is a person distinct from the Father by having a different relation of origin to the Father (procession), opposed to the Father's originating relation to him (spiration). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What, though, makes the Holy Spirit a person distinct from  <i class="calibre4">the Son</i>? It cannot simply be that he has a different relationship of origin to the Father than the Son does. Since these two relations are not opposed, they are not enough to bring about a distinction of persons in God. That requires an opposed relationship of the Holy Spirit to the Son, and not only to the Father. Since opposed relations can arise in God only where one person originates from another, either the Holy Spirit must originate from the Son, or the Son must originate from him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The suggestion that the Son in some way originates from the Spirit has found defenders in recent theology, but it has no clear roots in either eastern or western Christian tradition, and raises considerable theological problems of its own. Perhaps the most far-reaching of these is the disharmony it would create between the scriptural pattern of divine redemptive action in the world, where the Father sends the Son and the Father and the Son both send the Holy Spirit, and the pattern of eternal divine processions, about which—if Page 8 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> the Son in any sense originated from the Holy Spirit—the redemptive missions, following a contrary pattern, would fail to teach us (Marshall 2004a; Emery 2007: 360–412). The only alternative is that the Holy Spirit originates from the Son, and not from the Father alone. In other words, the Son, and not the Father alone, must be the term of the relationship of (passive) procession which makes the Holy Spirit a divine person distinct from his source, and the Son, as well as the Father, must be the subject of the opposed relation of spiration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Aquinas’ account, then, a relation of origin to the Son as well as to the Father is constitutive of the personal identity of the Holy Spirit, making him the unique divine person he is. Unless he originates from the Son, and not only from the Father, the Spirit will fail to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 408) </b>be a person distinct from the Son. The  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> is therefore necessary for the personal identity and integrity of the Holy Spirit. Where (opposed) relations take priority over modes of origin in constituting the identity of each divine person, the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> is not only a dogmatic fact or a defensible theological opinion, but is logically necessary if we are to have faith in the Trinity at all. Without it, a binity is the best we could do (for Aquinas’ argument here, see especially  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.36, a.2;  <i class="calibre4">Summa contra Gentiles</i>, Bk. IV, ch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">24; Emery 2007: 269–97). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Duns Scotus: The Identity of the Spirit Requires Diverse Relations,</b> <b class="calibre3">but not the</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Filioque</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">An alternative way of thinking about the personal identity of the Holy Spirit takes the difference between the way the Spirit originates from the Father and the way the Son originates as basic to the Spirit's personal uniqueness. Augustine had already pointed in this direction, with his insistence that the Spirit is a different person from the Son because he comes forth from the Father as one given, rather than as one born ( <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> V.14.15; <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. above). Advocates of this alternative did not fail to note that Augustine supports them, and cannot simply be cited on behalf of opposed relations (see Scotus,  <i class="calibre4">Reportatio</i> I-A, dist. 11, q.2, §24 (John Duns Scotus 2004: 412)). Anselm, Richard of St Victor, and especially Bonaventure make further observations suggesting that mode of origin is most basic to the identity and distinction of the divine persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only in the late thirteenth century, however, does this idea emerge as an explicit alternative to seeing opposed relations as basic, particularly regarding the person of the Holy Spirit. Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, and many after them (especially Franciscans) argue that the Holy Spirit, while he does in fact originate from the Son as well as from the Father, would be just the same divine person even if he originated from the Father alone. The Holy Spirit's origination from the Son therefore has no bearing on his personal identity or his distinction from the Son. His unique way of originating from the Father would suffice to account for his personal identity even if the Son did not share in the act by which the Spirit originates. Thus the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, while true, is not necessary for faith in the Trinity or a coherent Trinitarian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> Every actually existing individual, Scotus observes, must be distinct from all others by the possession of at least one property which no other individual has, and which is basic enough to give the possessor of that property a unique individual identity. When the individual is a being with reason, this ‘formal’ and ‘primary’ property will make the possessor a unique person (see  <i class="calibre4">Ordinatio</i> I, dist. 11, q.2, §43 (John Duns Scotus 1959: 19)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In God, both sides agree, the property constitutive of each person must be both relational and tied to origin. The two different ways in which origination can take place in God, namely generation and spiration, or procession according to intellect and procession according to will, give rise to several distinct or ‘disparate’ relations. Among these are paternity, filiation, and passive spiration (relations unique to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit respectively). All are agreed, moreover, that these relational properties  <i class="calibre4">in</i>   <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">(p. 409)</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">divinis</i>, like the two kinds of procession or origination which give rise to them, must in some way be irreducibly distinct from each other, or else there can be no Trinity—no real distinction of persons in God (though there is much disagreement about how to understand these distinctions among relations and processions in a way that comports with God's transcendence and simplicity). The various relations among the divine persons get their distinctive content or character from the different modes of origin which give rise to them; thus origin by generation gives rise to paternity and filiation, and origin by spiration gives rise to active and passive procession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given these shared assumptions, Scotus argues, the mere possession of the relational property of sonship or filiation suffices to distinguish the Son from all who do not possess this property—in particular from the Father and the Holy Spirit, with whom the Son shares one and the same divine nature, and all that goes with having that nature. Filiation is of course a relation, and the Son, as the subject of filiation, is constituted as a unique person by his possession of this relational property. As it happens filiation is opposed to the relation of paternity, which in God is constitutive of the person of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the fact that filiation is opposed to paternity, while obviously true, is  <i class="calibre4">not</i> what makes the Son a person distinct from the Father. Not the opposition of his filiation to paternity, but simply his possession of a basic (relational) property the Father does not have, makes the Son a unique person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All this applies in a more obvious way to the Son's distinction from the Holy Spirit. As long as filiation, being the Son of this Father, is a relational property no one else possesses (obviously including the Spirit), it is sufficient to make the Son a person distinct from all others. Filiation, moreover, is constitutive of the Son as an individual person, while active procession or spiration, the relation of origin he has with the Holy Spirit, is not. As all parties to the medieval debate recognized, the Son's relation of origin to the Holy Spirit cannot be constitutive of the Son's personal identity, since it is not unique to him. The Father has this same property or characteristic, and the Son has it from the Father. The fact that the Son too eternally brings forth the Holy Spirit does not affect his personal identity. He would be the same unique Son if, contrary to fact, the Holy Spirit did not proceed Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> from him (see Scotus,  <i class="calibre4">Reportatio</i> I-A, dist. 11, q.2, §§38–9, 41 (John Duns Scotus 2004: 416–17)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the relations they possess need only be different in content, and thus diverse, in order to constitute and distinguish the divine persons, the way is clear for seeing the Spirit as a person distinct from the Son apart from any opposed relations between them. While the Holy Spirit in fact exists in an opposed relation to the Son as well as to the Father (passive procession or spiration), this opposition—the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>—is not what makes him the unique person he is. Even though passive spiration is not opposed to filiation, the Holy Spirit's unique possession of this relational property suffices to make him a person distinct from the Son. His personal identity would be unaltered—he would be just the same Spirit—if, contrary to fact, he did not proceed from the Son. Scotus summarizes: If the Holy Spirit did not proceed from the Son, the Son would be distinguished from him in the same way in which he actually is distinct from him, namely by <b class="calibre3">(p. 410) </b>filiation. Thus even if the Holy Spirit did not proceed from him, the Son would still be distinguished from the Spirit by a disparate relation, without relative opposition. ( <i class="calibre4">Reportatio</i> I-A, dist. 11, q.2, §46 (John Duns Scotus 2004: 419; my translation))</p>
<p class="calibre1">To the objection that disparate relations alone cannot suffice to distinguish divine persons, since the Father possesses two such relations (paternity and active spiration) yet is only a single person, Scotus responds by arguing that relations multiply persons in God only when they are identity-constituting. Not all disparate relations in God are. Paternity, for example, constitutes the Father's personal uniqueness, not active spiration. Therefore one person can be the subject of several different relations of origin, though for each such relation there must be a different term. Thus the one Father can be the subject of both paternity and active spiration, but two different persons must terminate these two distinct relations, namely the Son and the Spirit ( <i class="calibre4">cf. Reportatio</i> I-A, dist. 11, q.2, §48 (John Duns Scotus 2004: 419)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ecumenical significance of this position is not lost on Scotus. It allows us to affirm the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, yet not regard ‘the Greeks’ as implicit deniers of the Trinity, despite their (mistaken) rejection of the western teaching on the Spirit's procession. If Aquinas’ position were right, Scotus observes, the ‘today's Greek [Christians] would be heretics, since a denial of the Trinity could obviously be inferred against them’ ( <i class="calibre4">Reportatio</i> I-A, dist. 11, q.2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">§46 (John Duns Scotus 2004: 418–19; my translation)). This is a conclusion we should avoid if we can. Like others after him, Scotus regards ecumenical fruitfulness as one reason to prefer his view that the divine persons are constituted by different modes of emanation and diverse relations to St Thomas's idea that opposed relations, and therefore the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, are necessary for coherent belief in the Trinity. (St Thomas, to be sure, thinks the eastern rejection of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> stems from confusion rather than heresy; see Thomas,  <i class="calibre4">De Potentia</i>, q.10, a.4,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>.; a.5,  <i class="calibre4">resp</i>. and ad14 (Thomas Aquinas 1934: 203–4, 218–19, 228)). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> Important as they are, the theological status of the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, and the quite basic question as to how we should conceive the personal identity of the Holy Spirit, are not the only factors involved in a decision between these two different ways of thinking about the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many other factors will also play a role, including how each view allows us to conceive the personal identity of the Father, the way we understand the applicability of logic and metaphysics to Trinitarian questions, and, as usual with basic theological decisions, which view's ongoing problems we are more willing to accept. Despite occasional claims to the contrary, neither view can claim to be required by normative Catholic doctrine (including the use by the Council of Florence (1442) of the formula, originating with Anselm, that in God ‘all things are one where an opposition of relation does not intervene’ (Tanner 1990: vol. 1, 570–1; translation altered; see Scotus,  <i class="calibre4">Reportatio</i> I-A, dist. 11, q.2, §48 (John Duns 2004: 419)). Which approach to the Trinity, and in particular to the identity of the Spirit, we ought to take remains a matter for theological dispute. In fact only a very fully worked-out Trinitarian theology, of a sort rarely seen for the last hundred years or more, could really constitute an adequate answer to this basic theological question. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 411) 3. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Indwelling Spirit</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Following numerous scriptural pointers, Christian theology has long tended to see a basic pattern in the saving work of the Trinity. Only the Holy Spirit, invisibly dwelling within the faithful through baptism, can lead human beings to the knowledge and love of the incarnate Son, just as the incarnate Son alone can lead us to the knowledge and love of the Father who is the generous source of all (e.g. in addition to the Johannine passages mentioned at the outset, Rom. 8:9–17, 26–30; 1 Cor. 12:3–6, 12–13; Gal. 4:4–7; Eph. 1:13–14). </p>
<p class="calibre1">St Irenaeus already makes this plain: ‘[T]hose who bear the Spirit of God are led to the Word, that is to the Son, while the Son presents [them] to the Father, and the Father furnishes incorruptibility’ ( <i class="calibre4">Demonstration</i> 7 (Irenaeus 1997: 44)). The pattern of the Trinity's temporal action thus reverses the pattern of the non-temporal origination of the persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Son originates eternally from the Father, and the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son (or, bracketing the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, from the Father  <i class="calibre4">of</i> the Son). When the Spirit comes in time, sent by the Father and the Son, he makes us those who ‘bear’ him, and so shows us the way back to the Father—that is, he shows us Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to his indwelling, or ‘invisible mission’, the Spirit also has a visible mission, wherein certain perceptible signs uniquely indicate his temporal presence. Of these the most obvious scriptural cases are the baptism of Jesus, where the Spirit descends and rests upon Jesus ‘in bodily form like a dove’ when he rises up from the waters of the Jordan (Lk. 3:22;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Matt. 3:16), and the day of Pentecost, when the Spirit, poured out by the exalted Jesus from the Father, descends upon the apostles in tongues of fire ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Acts 2:3–</p>
<p class="calibre1">4). While these signs publicly manifest the Spirit in his personal distinction from the Father and the Son, and so are indispensable to our knowledge of the Spirit's personal uniqueness (note the regular iconographic depiction of the Spirit as a bird in flight), they are nonetheless transitory. These signs are, moreover, exterior not only to us, but to the Spirit himself. In this they differ fundamentally from the humanity of Jesus in its relation Page 12 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p432"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> to the person of the Son. The union of the eternal Son with his humanity is contingent, but once accomplished is irreversible, and, as it were, interior to the person of the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit is not the dove or the tongue of fire, though they point to him, but God the Son <i class="calibre4">is</i> the human being Jesus; he has made Mary's human nature his own, and not simply a pointer to himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The deepest acquaintance we have with the person of the Spirit comes not through these visible signs, but through the Spirit's personal indwelling, which, though invisible, is immediate and aims to be permanent. By being closer to us than we are to ourselves ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">Confessions</i> III.6.11) the Spirit first of all leads us to Jesus Christ rather than teaching us about himself, yet this intimate indwelling is also, if indirectly, the chief way he instructs us concerning who he is. A frequently cited remark of Gregory Nazianzen regarding the gradual revelation of the Trinity makes just this point. While the old covenant chiefly manifested the Father, and the new covenant the Son, ‘at the present time’, St Gregory argues, ‘the Spirit resides amongst us, giving us a clearer manifestation of himself than before’ ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 31.26 (Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 137)). The  <b class="calibre3">(p. 412) </b>Son's most intimate relation with a creature, his personal union with the fruit of the Virgin's womb, is external to us. The Holy Spirit's most intimate relation with a creature, by contrast, is interior to us—or more precisely, interior to the human being Jesus, who sends the promised Advocate and Comforter by giving us a share in his own full possession of the Spirit. This indwelling of the Spirit is not the greatest possible unity of a divine person with a creature, namely the personal or hypostatic union in virtue of which the human being Jesus just is God the eternal Son, and conversely. The faithful are not the same person as the Spirit who by grace indwells them, but the Spirit's indwelling joins creatures to him in the closest way there can be short of this hypostatic union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Holy Spirit's indwelling is fully personal. The Spirit brings about in us an intimacy with himself which, while inseparable from that which we enjoy with the Son and the Father, is unique to the Spirit himself. More than simply the agent of our union with the Son and the Father, the Spirit impresses his own personal character upon us, so that we rejoice, with Jesus, in him ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Lk. 10:21). In sanctifying grace he gives himself to be enjoyed by us as our own possession. At the same time the Spirit himself takes possession of us, making us the temple in which he dwells: ‘You are not your own’ (1 Cor. 6:19;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 3:16 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.43, a.3). In the theological terms traditionally used to make this point, there is a ‘proper’ relation of the Spirit to the justified in grace, and not only an </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘appropriated’ relation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This has been a controversial claim, especially in modern Catholic theology, since it may seem to fall afoul of the important principle that with respect to creatures, ‘the works of the Trinity are undivided’ ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> I.5.8 (Augustine 1991: 70)). But there need be no conflict here. Just as the one action of all three persons brings about a relation of the Son to human nature which is unique or proper to him, namely hypostatic union ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.3, a.4), so also the one action of the three, the Father and the Son as sending and the Spirit as being sent, brings about the ‘proper’ indwelling of the Spirit, configuring us to the one sent in his personal uniqueness. ‘As each individ</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p433"></a><b class="calibre3">The Deep Things of God: Trinitarian Pneumatology</b> ual person possesses the divine nature in a particular way, so each can also possess a created nature in his own personal way, and to that extent exclusively’ (Scheeben 1946: 166; translation altered; cf. Thomas Aquinas, ST I, q.42, a.6, ad3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Love—more exactly  <i class="calibre4">caritas</i>, the perfection of self-donation—is the chief personal characteristic the Holy Spirit impresses upon us by dwelling within us. The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son eternally as love in person, the fruit and seal of the Father's infinite donation of himself to the Son, infinitely returned by the Son. By coming to dwell personally in us, being shed abroad in our hearts (Rom. 5:5;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 8:9–17), the Holy Spirit makes us also into selfless lovers of God, temples of charity. Or more precisely, his indwelling begins this reformation of the rational creature now, and perfects it in eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, the love with which we love God is simply the fullest possible creaturely share in the love with which the Father and the Son love one another from before the foundation of the world—the person of the Holy Spirit himself. In this way Trinitarian pneumatology understands the prayer of Jesus to be verified in the very being of Christians: ‘that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them’ (Jn 17:26). </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines the relationship between the Trinity and creation, which belongs to the broader dogmatic framework of God's interaction with the world. It outlines some traditional and contemporary views of the human being as an image of God and discusses the analogical relationships between the triune God and creation. It explores the problem of avoiding anthropomorphism and examines contemporary theologies that seek to affirm ontological links between the Trinity and created realities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, creation, God, human being, anthropomorphism, contemporary theologies The relationship between the Trinity and creation belongs to the broader dogmatic framework of God's interaction with the world. The following discussion focuses on theological anthropology, leaving out other important issues regarding the broader framework, for instance, the nature of revelation, divine attributes, and theological ontology. First, some traditional views of the human being as an image of God are outlined. Then the analogical relationships between the triune God and creation are discussed, focusing on the problem of avoiding anthropomorphism. In the third section some contemporary accounts are evaluated from the perspective of Trinitarian anthropology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Image and Likeness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The creation of human beings to the ‘image and likeness’ (Gen. 1:26) of God has, since patristic times, prompted theological discussion on the relationship between God and human beings. Although sin has, according to Catholic doctrine, deformed the divine likeness of humans, Christian anthropology states that the basic theological definition of human being as an image of God has not been completely destroyed by sin. Even when it is maintained that the divine image in us is lost due to sin, the authors normally also presume that some other level or aspect of this ‘being an image’ is preserved ( <i class="calibre4">Gaudium et</i> <i class="calibre4">spes</i> no. 22; Crouzel 1980). Therefore, created human beings continue to reflect aspects of their Creator and they continue to have the dignity of being a person. But this doctrine Page 1 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p436"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> does not necessarily imply that the image of God in the human being is recognized as a Trinitarian image. Some theologians, most notably Augustine (1991), develop a psychological Trinitarian imagery, whereas others, for instance, the authors of  <i class="calibre4">The Catechism of</i> <i class="calibre4">the Catholic Church</i> (§§356–68, 370), discuss the normative doctrine of image without Trinitarian differentiation, noting that ‘in no way is God a man's image’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 415) </b>Eastern theology in particular attempts to define the relationship between God and created human nature through employing a consistent distinction between image and likeness. In terms of this distinction, our being an image reflects our human nature, whereas the attribute of likeness refers to a category of perfection which is accomplished by grace or other supernatural reality. This distinction is present already in Irenaeus, Clemens of Alexandria, and Origen. In Greek theology it is often connected with the dynamics of deification, in which the likeness to God grows gradually in the process of salvation. In Christian initiation and subsequent progress of Christian life, human nature as image is thus complemented with the increasing presence of divine likeness. The goal of salvific process, theosis or deification, thus comprises the Christian's being as both image and perfect likeness. Likeness does not mean, however, identity with God (Crouzel 1980; Saarinen 2002; Christensen and Wittung 2007). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although western theology sometimes employs the distinction between image and likeness ( <i class="calibre4">similitudo</i>) and can affirm the ideal of theosis, it does not normally focus on this distinction as a major theme of Christian progress and salvation. This historical observation has provoked debate regarding the different relationship between God and creation in eastern and western theology. It has been suggested that while the eastern theology operates with the concept of Platonic participation in God, the western theology prefers to speak of God's interaction with the world in terms of efficient causality (Hallonsten 2007: 286). This might, however, be an oversimplification, as the individual Church Fathers in East and West apply the ideas of causation and participation in different and complementary ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time it is heuristically fruitful to treat the eastern and western discussions separately. The western discussion normally presupposes a fundamental difference between God and creation; this fundamental difference is not overcome by means of participation and Christian progress, but the concept of analogy as well as elaborate linguistic reflections are needed in order to formulate God's interaction with creation. Although the final goal and fulfilment of this interaction may also in the West be conceived as a participation in God, the elaboration of this fundamental difference employs technical vocabularies which stem from the western institutions of rational learning and education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine's discussion of the so-called psychological Trinity in books VIII–XV of his  <i class="calibre4">De</i> <i class="calibre4">Trinitate</i> (1991) exemplifies this intellectual tendency of western theology. As it is treated in more detail elsewhere in this volume, we outline it only in so far as it is relevant for our theme. Because this discussion also appears, in a somewhat abridged and modified fashion, in Peter Lombard's  <i class="calibre4">Sentences</i> (Peter Lombard 1971: Bk. 1, dist. 3, ch. 2), for centuries it had a formative significance for the Latin reflection on Christian anthropology. In Page 2 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> Book VIII, Augustine establishes an ontological link between God and human self with the concepts of goodness and truth. The highest level of human inner self, the mind ( <i class="calibre4">mens</i>), contains an image of the Trinity. When the human mind knows itself and loves itself, a triad of mind, self-knowledge and self-love emerges in which the three constituents are coequal, mutually related but unconfused. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 416) </b>This triad does not refer to the different faculties of the human soul in its totality, but the mind also contains lower cognitive and affective functions. Augustine further teaches that when the mind does not consider itself, but another, it becomes memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Likewise, the concepts of understanding and will are so called with reference to another (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> X.11.18). Given this, there are two Trinitarian images in the human mind: while the mind as created and the natural image of God remembers, understands, and loves itself, the final and perfect image of God consists in the mind's remembering, understanding, and loving another, namely God. The emergence of this final image is a lifelong process of grace working in humans. When Augustine describes this final perfection he refers to Gen. 1:26 and 1 Jn 3:2: ‘We shall be like him because we shall see him as he is’ (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> XIV.12.15 and XIV.19.25). After this conclusion, however, Augustine warns in Book XV that the mental image of the Trinity remains enigmatic and mysterious; its dissimilarity and unlikeness to the original should also be remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine's elaboration of the psychological Trinity reveals an intellectual striving for theological understanding. God is fundamentally different from creation, but a thorough analysis of the inner structure of the human mind reveals Trinitarian structures. The end result of this analysis is not, however, radically different from Greek theology, as Augustine also sees the perfection to consist in a participation in God and in increasing likeness to God. In this process of growing participation, the mental image turns away from itself and begins to remember, understand, and love God. On the one hand, Augustine conceives this process as knowing, recognizing, and seeing, either from a mirror or face to face. But it is also a process of restoration, growing conformity to God, and receiving of divine gifts. The intellectual emphasis does not rule out the ontological process but rather supports and illuminates it. The emerging ‘super-image’ is likeness to the Trinitarian God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the mental image cannot be used for the closer explanation of Trinitarian persons, Augustine's psychological Trinity in many ways focuses on the primacy of persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As memory and mind, the first person is the source of everything else; as knowledge and understanding, the second person is born from the first; as love, the third person connects the first with the second, enabling coherent external action. As the three instances are not faculties but simply represent the mind in its different activities, the essence or nature of the mind is not to be discussed apart from its three representations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relationship between essence and persons was discussed in the fourth Lateran Council (1215) in which Joachim de Fiore's view was condemned. This condemnation formulates some classical principles regarding the similarity between the Creator and creation, reiterating the cautions expressed by Augustine in Book XV of  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>. Joachim op</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p438"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> posed Peter Lombard's view, according to which the divine essence neither generates nor is generated nor proceeds, being thus distinct from all three persons. For Joachim, Lombard's view adds a fourth agent into divinity. The council confirmed Peter Lombard's teaching, concluding that the divine nature is not a fourth agent but  <b class="calibre3">(p. 417) </b>the three persons together and each one of them separately (Tanner and Alberigo 1990: 231–2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This decision is important already in itself, since it contributes to the alleged western development in which the unity of divine nature in some sense precedes the Trinitarian persons (Hennessy 2007). For our topic, the condemnation of Joachim is also significant for other reasons. Joachim had argued that the ecumenical prayer of Jesus in Jn 17:22, ‘that they may be one, as we are one’, denies the postulate of additional essence. If the Father and the Son are one in the same sense as the faithful are one, then the unity at stake here is one among persons. It cannot be understood ‘in the sense of a single reality which is common to all’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The council, however, decided that Jn 17:22 should not be read in this manner. The faithful constitute ‘a union of love in grace’, whereas the Father and the Son form ‘a unity of identity in nature’. In this manner the analogy from God to created reality is no strict correspondence: the divine unity of persons is significantly different from the ecclesiastical unity in the created reality. To point this out, the council formulates its famous hermeneutical rule: ‘For between creator and creature there can be noted no likeness ( <i class="calibre4">similitudo</i>) so great that a greater dissimilarity ( <i class="calibre4">dissimilitudo</i>) cannot be seen between them’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The decisions of 1215 have been contested from various angles. Martin Luther, for instance, claimed that one should affirm the sentence ‘the essence generates’ in order to avoid the problematic separation of essence from persons (Helmer 1999: 107–113). Although the condemnation does not address Augustine's psychological Trinity, it can also be argued that the hermeneutical rule weakens Augustine's argument in  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i>. A third angle concerns the general relationship between God and creation. If even Trinitarian analogies stated in a biblical text need to be read with a view to the dissimilarity rather than likeness, then most attempts to argue that a created structure reflects Trinitarian realities are to be regarded with suspicion. At the same time, the likeness between Creator and created reason postulated in the decisions of 1215 remains a real analogy, as Benedict XVI emphasizes in his recent Regensburg lecture (Benedict XVI: 2006). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Council of Florence (1441) continued to emphasize the priority of divine essence, saying that in God and divine persons ‘everything is one where the difference of a relation does not prevent this’ (Tanner and Alberigo 1990: 570–1). Given this unity, the possibility to establish created Trinitarian analogies on the basis of divine persons becomes more difficult. Medieval Trinitarian theology is characterized by the scholastic attempts to formulate specific rules of Trinitarian speech. These rules often focus on the differences between Trinitarian speech and ordinary, Aristotelian syllogistics (Kärkkäinen 2007). The uniqueness of the Trinity is thus emphasized, while analogies with creation are downgraded. The nature of Trinitarian language and its ability to shed light on the divine mystery has, however, remained a vital discussion topic of western dogmatics. In contempo</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p439"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> rary discussions this has again become a topic of interest between eastern and western Trinitarian theologians. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 418) Avoiding Anthropomorphism: Trinitarian </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Language and the Created World</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The theological relationship between the Trinity and created, anthropological reality has often been discussed as a problem of language and semantics: what do we mean when we speak of the Trinity? Philosophical theories of language offer points of comparison when this problem is addressed. A traditional way of constructing a theory of language is to state that words and sentences have their proper or literal meanings. Literal meanings express correspondences to the external objects of the world. In theology, as well as in many other abstract contexts, this concrete view of language easily leads to anthropomorphisms and other failures to grasp ideas which are not represented as concrete objects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One strategy of alleviating the problem of anthropomorphism consists in making a distinction between the proper and improper, that is, metaphorical or analogical, use of words and expressions. With the help of this distinction it could be claimed, for instance, that theological sentences are to be read as metaphors: although their terms and descriptions bear certain resemblance to the ordinary meanings, they should not be read in their proper literal sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another theory of language claims that our ordinary language does not primarily consist of correspondences between words and objects, but of rules and usages which guide our communication. Medieval Trinitarian theology sometimes employs a fairly consistent rule theory of language in which the internal ‘rules of faith’ define the way to construct orthodox Trinitarian sentences. The danger or poverty of this approach consists in the lack of external relevance of rule-based sentences. If their terms and descriptions do not have anything in common with ordinary language, no analogy with the created realm illuminates our understanding. A consistent rule theory of doctrine may thus degenerate into an idiosyncratic language-game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The agreed statement of the International Commission for Anglican-Orthodox Theological Dialogue,  <i class="calibre4">The Church of the Triune God</i> (2008), pays detailed attention to the nature of Trinitarian language and its relationship to anthropological realities. The statement acknowledges that ‘analogies, metaphors and symbols are among the common tools of theology’. At the same time the statement distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate uses of metaphors, especially when they aim at illustrating divine reality. According to the statement, the risk of dogmatic misunderstanding is smaller when God is compared to an inanimate object (rock) or to an animal (flock of birds). Symbols taken from human activities, on the other hand, carry a greater risk of mediating a mistaken insight into God's life. The provisional character of metaphors should always be remembered (International Commission for Anglican-Orthodox Theological Dialogue 2008: §§34, 35, 38). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p440"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> To avoid misunderstandings, the statement distinguishes between illustrative metaphors and iconic language. Trinitarian language is not metaphorical: ‘When God is called Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Christian theology is not using illustrative metaphor’. <b class="calibre3">(p. 419)</b> Although these terms are borrowed from human life, they do not convey the image of natural parenthood. Arius falsely took ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ as anthropological metaphors and misunderstood them, teaching, for instance, that a son must be younger than his father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In our times, these terms have been understood as gender-specific language which supports patriarchal structures in a problematic manner. The Church Fathers, however, ‘deny that the earthly meaning of fatherhood, or any gender-specific language, has any application to God’ (International Commission for Anglican-Orthodox Theological Dialogue 2008: </p>
<p class="calibre1">§§39, 40). This is because these terms are no illustrative metaphors and thus do not have their foundation in the ordinary meanings of what it is to be human. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, the significant matter in these terms is ‘the ontological derivation of the Three Persons and the total personal mutuality thus designated’. The names of the three persons are iconic because ‘they are transparent to the reality of God’. Iconic language is not rooted in human experience; it is given by revelation as it is expressed in the Bible and ecclesial tradition. Iconic language ‘is not based on the distinction between subject and object, like analogies and metaphors’. Instead, it is ‘based on the fact that theology can attain its fullness only within the ecclesial body’. The names of the three divine persons </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘properly express their personal identity and cannot be changed’. How these words are understood is controlled by ‘theology and worship alike’ (International Commission for Anglican-Orthodox Theological Dialogue 2008: §§36, 39, 41). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This ambitious outline of Trinitarian language, which employs many insights of John of Pergamon, the Orthodox co-chair of the dialogue (Zizioulas 1997 and 2007), is critical of the philosophical solutions described above. The statement argues consistently that the names of the Trinitarian persons cannot be understood as anthropological metaphors. At the same time the criticism also pertains to the options of correspondence theory and rule theory of language. Rule theory is not iconic, for it does not claim anything with regard to divine transparency. A simple correspondence theory would be even more Arian than the metaphorical view of Trinitarian language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘iconic language’ described in the statement probably does not aim to be a theory of language at all: it is only applied to the three divine names which function as pictures or icons in particular doctrinal sentences. As icon the personal name does not allow for a distinction between subject and object, but the divine identity is ‘expressed’ or mediated through the use of the name. The iconic name may preserve some aspects of correspondence, because it ‘expresses’ something, as well as some aspects of a rule of faith, in so far as its usage is safeguarded by ecclesial theology and liturgical language. In this manner the iconic name enables participation in divine reality through being itself a non-experiential channel of transparency. The iconic word mediates without distinguishing between the name and its divine reference, which remains a mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p441"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> Another ecumenical document,  <i class="calibre4">Confessing the One Faith</i> (1991), drafted by the Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches, does call ‘Father’ a symbol and even a metaphor. The name ‘Father’ is a distinctive term which cannot be replaced and which does not attribute maleness to God. But Jesus did use some of the characteristics of human fatherhood in speaking of God, the document maintains (Faith and Order Commission 1991: §§49–52). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 420) </b>Western theology probably finds it less difficult to state that ‘Father’ and ‘Son’ are metaphors or symbols in the sense that, in addition to being divine names, they also express some likeness by means of ordinary language. The western understanding of theological analogy proceeds from the assumption that ‘a greater dissimilarity’ is always also presupposed; thus the fundamental difference between the Creator and creature is safeguarded and the claim of metaphorical likeness is relatively unproblematic. In the eastern understanding of ‘likeness’, however, a grace-based progress towards divinity is already presupposed. Theological analogies based on anthropological likeness may therefore become regarded with suspicion. The person of the Father, for instance, is not theologically transparent by means of natural likeness to human fathers, but through the iconic representation of the personal name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the eastern understanding of iconic language may thus differ from the Latin doctrine of analogy, the western approaches also aim at safeguarding the mystery of Trinitarian persons in God's revelation to the world. Eberhard Jüngel's elaboration of metaphorical language in his  <i class="calibre4">God as the Mystery of the World</i> (1986) offers a prominent example of such an approach. Jüngel follows the more recent understandings of metaphor which do not consider metaphors as simply improper or decorative use of language. Instead, metaphors exemplify the semantically expansive uses of language: when we want to speak about new phenomena, for instance, technological innovations or new ideologies, we apply our traditional concepts to cover new areas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jüngel sometimes calls theological language a ‘catachrestic’ speech (Jüngel 1986: 401): catachresis is a misapplication of a word, but in this case the misuse is intended and the speaker has no other adequate options. Through the expansion of traditional semantics theology can capture something of its transcendent object. Metaphor and catachresis thus do not express an improper meaning, but they reach out beyond the old literal meaning. At the same time Jüngel wants to follow Karl Barth (Barth 1946: 82–92) and that line of Protestant theology which is critical of ‘analogy of being’ and wants to replace it with an ‘analogy of faith’. Protestant reservations regarding the analogy of being have often been similar to the criticism of ‘illustrative metaphor’ in  <i class="calibre4">The Church of the Triune God</i>: the analogical illustrations of theological truth by means of anthropological and other worldly relationships may distort the Christian concept of God. Many versions of the analogy of faith are, therefore, closer to a rule theory of language than to a correspondence theory. Jüngel, however, does not want to give up the idea of correspondence ( <i class="calibre4">Entsprechung</i>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> For Jüngel, theology is centred on God's coming into the world. Analogies should not be designed to describe everything about God, but they can to an extent illustrate the event of divine coming. Jüngel calls this theological strategy the ‘analogy of advent’ (Jüngel 1986: 389–91, 402–4). This analogy says that ‘x's coming to a corresponds to how b is related to c’. In this analogy, x stands for God's activity and a stands for the object of God's coming. For instance, we can say that the kingdom of heaven (x), coming into the world (a), is like treasure (b) hidden in the field (c). The figure of treasure hidden in the field can give meaning to the coming of God's kingdom: it resembles the event of discovering a hidden treasure. At the same time the treasure hidden in the field, in itself, says  <b class="calibre3">(p. 421)</b> nothing of the Christian God. There is no  <i class="calibre4">a priori</i> ontological resemblance, but the figure of the analogy of advent equips the human being to speak about God in ways which require semantic expansion. The analogy of advent is in this sense a linguistic tool, a sort of necessary metaphor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Trinitarian theology it is important to see that ‘coming’ is a one-way relation in which God comes to the world, not vice versa. The analogy does not provide a view to divine immanence; one may also say that no such semantic ascent is presupposed in which the worldly phenomenon becomes a metaphor for heavenly things. Both sides of the analogy are limited to the created realm: the illustration depicts a worldly phenomenon  <i class="calibre4">per se</i>, while the object of this illustration depicts God's coming to the world in the economy of salvation. God is thus the mystery of the  <i class="calibre4">world</i>, because the analogy of advent takes its explanatory force from the worldly phenomena. God also remains the  <i class="calibre4">mystery</i> of the world, because the analogy does not reveal ‘x’, the unknown agent behind the event of coming. The analogy reveals the event, not the mystery behind it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinitarian theology has a central importance for Jüngel's analogy of advent. The crucifixion of Jesus is a deeply Trinitarian event because the Father then reveals himself in distinction and even ‘absolute opposition’ to the Son, as Webster points out (Webster 1986: 72). At the same time, this distinction formulates a unity of life and death. The bond of love, the Spirit, is needed not only to connect the ends of this distinction, but to show how God is love and how the unity of life and death is, finally, in favour of life. Jüngel does not, however, present an account of the immanent Trinity, for he basically aims at showing how the event of crucifixion reveals the coming of God to us and for us in its Trinitarian totality. The crucified Christ is for Jüngel nothing less than a trace or vestige of the Trinity ( <i class="calibre4">vestigium Trinitatis</i>; Jüngel 1986: 470–505). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The event of the crucifixion finds a broader application in how God ‘comes’ in three persons. The Father is the absolute origin. As Son, God comes to God through the history of incarnation. As Holy Spirit, God's being remains in coming from God to God as bond of love (Jüngel 1986: 522–34). Although these three modes of coming are in some sense immanent to God, Jüngel wants to say that God's Trinitarian immanence can only be grasped through God's coming to the world in Jesus Christ, in particular through the cross. The analogy of advent prevents a semantical ascent from earthly to heavenly; but it affirms a sort of expansive and explanatory descent: divine coming or descent gives meaning to the theological language which, in turn, can illustrate this descent in its dif</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p443"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> ferentiated unity. Anthropology thus needs to be seen in the light of this theological perspective revealed in the advent of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jüngel's account shows how human language can both reveal and conceal the divine mystery in western thought. Without denying the theological adequacy of analogy and metaphor it manages to avoid the anthropomorphic exaggerations of ontological similarity in speaking about the Trinity. Jüngel also takes a definite stance in the broader discussion on the relationship between the immanent and the economic Trinity. This relationship is in some ways similar to the Greek distinction between ‘theology’ and ‘economy’ in which economy pertains to the imperfect phenomenal world. Thomas Aquinas distinguishes between God's immanent and transient activity (Thomas Aquinas 1888–1906:  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q. </p>
<p class="calibre1">27, a.1 and a.5). In the West it has been common to think that while God's immanent ( <i class="calibre4">ad</i> <i class="calibre4">intra</i>) actions pertain to one person, God's activities in creation ( <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>) are common to all three persons. In contemporary theology, the discussion has centred on Karl Rahner's thesis (Rahner 1967: 328) according to which ‘the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jüngel affirms Rahner's thesis and considers that it opens a new way of establishing the doctrine of the Trinity as a theology of the crucifixion (Jüngel 1986: 507). Although Jüngel does not proceed from anthropology, his analogy of advent thus builds upon the ‘economy’, that is, the worldly realities on which our language is fundamentally dependent. In the analogy of advent, God's reality is expressed in terms of ‘coming’. This coming is fundamentally an aspect of God's work  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>; at the same time it also reveals something of God's inner differentiation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rahner's thesis has its problems, as its straightforward application may lead to a reduction of Trinitarian immanence towards the economy of salvation (Kasper 1982: 215). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the thesis succeeds in defending the unity of the Trinitarian God, it also needs to be further elaborated with a view of how the individual divine persons are constituted in divine immanence (Pannenberg 1988: 355–64). For our topic, the most relevant aspect of Rahner's thesis concerns the anthropological elaboration of the economy of salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When contemporary theologians affirm the identity of immanent and economic Trinity, they often ascribe Trinitarian structures to human institutions instead of merely stating that God's work  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> is indivisible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Anthropology in the Context of Society, Church, and Religions</b> In contemporary theology it is common to combine Trinitarian theology with the analysis of society, Church, and even different religions. While other chapters of this book deal more extensively with these issues, we need to discuss briefly the anthropological foundations of these aspects of Trinitarian theology and their relationship to the doctrine of analogy. We will focus on three examples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> In his  <i class="calibre4">Trinity and Society</i> (1988) Leonardo Boff uses Trinitarian theology for the purpose of reforming and liberating human society. He emphasizes the role of divine persons and their mutual interpenetration ( <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i>). For Boff, this perichoresis establishes a strongly inclusive communion in which ‘each Person receives everything from others and at the same time gives everything to others’. Boff affirms Rahner's thesis which for him also manifests the inclusive sharing in our history (Boff 1988: 147, 214–15). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Human beings ‘find the roots of their being in the superabundance of life, love and communion that comes from the Father, is filtered through the Son and poured out in the Holy Spirit’. Calling God the Father includes for Boff also calling God the Mother; in this sense the first person is inclusive. Also the Son has a feminine dimension. Being the <b class="calibre3">(p. 423) </b>Son means opposition to slavery: in this sense the second person expresses freedom and liberation from oppressive structures. Being the Son entails both obedience to the Father and resistance which may provoke conflict. Through the Son human beings are liberated from the slavery of sin and they are given back the freedom of sons and daughters of God. The Holy Spirit is the ‘driving force of integral liberation’: the Spirit transforms the old world and leads it to a new creation. The Spirit is at work when the poor become conscious of their oppression, organize their forces, and denounce those who keep them in chains (Boff 1988: 168–71, 181–3, 208). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boff also applies Trinitarian structures to historical time, saying that, in history, one can detect a simultaneity of the ages of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The age of the Father means that a heavenly ‘Father-Mother’ makes up eternal goodness in governing the world. The age of the Son means the liberation of humanity from powers of oppression to a new life. The age of the Holy Spirit continues and interiorizes this new life in individuals and social movements. The course of history thus reflects and unfolds the inclusive communion of the divine persons (Boff 1988: 228–30). In this manner a comprehensive analogy between the Trinity and the history of human society emerges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boff's view is vulnerable to criticism because its use of anthropological analogy is so strong and concrete. Proceeding from the created nature of being a son or being a parent, he draws conclusions regarding what it means to be a divine person. The danger of anthropomorphism is thus apparent. While it is obvious that Boff's strategy may downgrade Trinitarian theology to become a means towards some political end, one also needs to see that the western tradition of using analogies allows for a great variety of superficial correspondences between God and creation. It is theoretically possible to claim an analogy while also maintaining that ‘a greater dissimilarity’ needs to be presupposed. A more restricted and rigorous use of correspondence, of which Jüngel's analogy of advent is an example, counteracts this superficial tendency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fundamental issue of Trinitarian anthropology concerns the analogy between Trinitarian communion and a larger group of human persons, such as the society or the Church. Is it theologically legitimate to see Trinitarian features in a group of humans, given that the classical doctrine of ‘image and likeness’ focuses on the nature of an individual human Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> person? If yes, then a sort of ‘theological social anthropology’ could emerge. Boff's theology exemplifies, however, the risks of such an approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In today's doctrinal documents it is common to compare the Trinitarian communion and the Church; this strategy is used in  <i class="calibre4">Unitatis redintegratio</i> (ch. 1, no. 2) which is quoted in <i class="calibre4">The Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> (§813). This language is rooted in many biblical passages, for instance, Jn 17:21–2, Eph. 1:18–22 and 4:4–6. While one can thus present analogies between the Trinity and the Church, one also needs to think about the criteria of legitimate analogies. For instance, a straightforward argument claiming that the Church can be pluralistic because the divine communion also consists of a plurality of persons violates the central tenet of unity present in the biblical passages and other normative theological texts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miroslav Volf's book  <i class="calibre4">After Our Likeness: The Church as the Image of Trinity</i> (1998) is one of many contemporary attempts to formulate an ecclesiology based on a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 424) </b>theologically adequate use of Trinitarian language. In Volf's view, the western preference for psychological analogies derives from the primacy of essence, while the eastern primacy of persons favours social analogies (Volf 1998: 200). Our discussion of Augustine's psychological Trinity has yielded a slightly different result, but later medieval development in the West may also offer support to Volf's view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Volf sees the potential problems of psychological and social ideals and discusses Immanuel Kant's view, according to which ‘absolutely nothing can be acquired for practical life from the doctrine of Trinity’ (Volf 1998: 198; Kant 1964: 50). His own view differs from Kant, since he believes that the ‘this-worldly character of God's self-revelation makes it possible to convert Trinitarian ideas into ecclesiological ideas’. But Volf also wants to define clear limits to the use of analogy, emphasizing that in addition to postulating analogies one needs to know ‘how the church is to correspond concretely to the divine communion’ in its historical reality (Volf 1998: 199–200). This means many different things which need to be discussed in detail. The leadership of the Church, for instance, must occur as a collegial exercise of office. The various gifts of Christians in the Church likewise correspond to the divine multiplicity. In these ‘trinitarianizations’ of the Church structure Volf recommends an understanding of catholicity as ‘differentiated unity’ which is sufficient to counteract the dangers of pluralism (Volf 1998: 218, 262–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Volf affirms a correspondence between the Trinity and the Church, but he also sees the great variety of analogical options which this affirmation implies. It is therefore not sufficient merely to state the existence of a given correspondence, but its dynamics needs to be worked out in detail. In comparing Volf with Boff one also needs to pay attention to their different points of departure: while analogies between the Trinity and the Church are widely accepted and can be biblically grounded, the postulate of an analogy between the Trinity and society involves several difficulties and risks. Although both the Church and the society are created realities, they reveal—and conceal—the mystery of their Creator in different fashion. The postulate of an anthropological analogy between the Trinity Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p446"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> and a group of human persons may thus yield very different theologies which need to be judged differently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark Heim's study  <i class="calibre4">The Depth of the Riches: A Trinitarian Theology of Religious Ends</i> (2001) elevates the doctrine of analogy to a new level. Heim wants to interpret the plurality of religions with the help of Trinitarian considerations. In Christian theology, the Trinity is ‘a non-reductive religious ultimate’. It functions ‘like a musical polyphony, a simultaneous, non-excluding harmony of difference that constitutes one unique reality’. Because human interaction with the triune God can take different forms, and because some of these forms are present in other religions, it is impossible simply ‘to believe in the Trinity instead of the distinctive claims of all other religions’ (Heim 2001: 167). In other words, the riches and the depth (Rom. 11:33) of the triune God contain some aspects present in the truth-claims of other religions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heim does not, however, advocate open-ended pluralism. While Heim emphasizes that the different religious ends are genuinely different, he also maintains that the Trinitarian concept of the Christian God involves an overflow of meanings. Heim  <b class="calibre3">(p. 425) </b>argues with the help of anthropology, claiming that two persons can meet each other in three fundamentally different ways. First, in terms of an impersonal and universally valid encounter. Second, I can become acquainted with you so that your distinctive personality comes into focus. Third, we can meet in order to share the same experience. These three ways of encounter express a correspondence to the Trinitarian persons; in this manner the Christian doctrine of God contains the overflow of meanings based on the different personal modes of encounter. At the same time Heim claims that these three ways of personal contact are important channels of divine encounter in other religions. The relational anthropology of human encounter thus connects Trinitarian Christianity with other religions. Often the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘relation with God can be tuned or concentrated in one of these channels, with distinctive religious results’ (Heim 2001: 184–5). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heim is not claiming that all religions reflect a Trinitarian God or that all religions promote similar ends. He wants to show that the different ends of different religions in their particular ways contain aspects which are also present in the ‘depth of the riches’ of the Trinitarian mystery. This bold strategy opens a new field of discussion regarding the relationship between the Trinity and theological anthropology, in particular since the analogy is built upon the different modes of interpersonal encounter. The fruitfulness of this approach depends on the general evaluation of other religions. If they are considered to resemble the secular ideals and ideologies of human society, then Heim's approach faces problems of anthropomorphism similar to Boff's account. But if other religions are seen as containing some seeds of divine truth and goodness, then the relevant point of comparison is the Church and its correspondence with the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We saw that in Augustine's Trinitarian theology truth and goodness establish the ontological links between the Trinity and created realities. Heim also emphasizes God's goodness and the religious search for truth, stating that one religious tradition cannot claim a monopoly on these basic constituents of all creation (Heim 2001: 30–1, 295–6). If he is right, Page 12 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p447"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, Creation, and Christian Anthropology</b> then the analogy between the Trinity and all religions resembles Augustine's psychological analogy as well as the correspondence between the Trinity and the Church. Obviously, Heim's bold proposal of an interreligious social anthropology needs careful discussion before it can be properly evaluated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout this chapter I have focused on the nature of analogy between the Trinity and creation. This strategy is proper in western Christianity in which a fundamental difference between God and creation is assumed. But it may not be applied to the eastern view of participation in the same manner, since this view maintains that the human likeness to God increases in the process of grace and deification. In this process, the subject and object of human-divine correspondence do not remain separated by the fundamental difference but they are themselves relative to the broader salvific process. The postulate of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘iconic language’ may avoid some difficulties related to this phenomenon, if we assume that the iconic word can provide a short cut to the divine name and mystery. Western doctrines of analogy, however, normally presuppose a fundamental difference between the triune God and creation. To bridge this difference, linguistic analogies and  <b class="calibre3">(p. 426)</b> metaphors are employed. At the same time, they necessarily remain imperfect and one-dimensional portrayals of the divine mystery. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article analyzes the interrelation among the doctrine of Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments. It explains that the Trinity, the Church and the Sacraments are inseparably linked in Christian faith because the Church sees her faith in her sacramental practice, which in turn is based on Trinitarian faith. It argues that the theology of the Church requires first not an account of its visible structures but an account of how humans, through the missions of Christ and the Holy Spirit, come to share in the relationships of the divine Persons. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The most explicitly Trinitarian text of the New Testament has a sacramental—ecclesial content: ‘Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’ (Matt. 28:19). In the name of the Trinity, nations are being made a community through baptism. This is a community that shares in divine life by adoption. The members of the Church are the adopted sons of the Father, thanks to the missions of the Son and of the Spirit: But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, ‘Abba, Father!’ Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. (Gal. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments are inseparably linked in Christian faith. The Church sees her faith in her sacramental practice, which in turn is based on Trinitarian faith. St Irenaeus ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.180) explains that the rule of faith is organized around the confession of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and ‘for this reason the baptism of our regeneration takes place through these three articles, granting us regeneration unto God the Father through His Son by the Holy Spirit’ (Irenaeus 1997: 44). St Basil of Caesarea, in his treatise  <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.374–5), relates our faith and salvation to our baptism and our liturgical proclamation of the glory of the Trinity: <b class="calibre3">(p. 429)</b> Whence is it that we are Christians? Through our faith, would be the universal answer. And in what way are we saved? Plainly because we were regenerated through the grace given in our baptism. How else could we be? And after recognising that this salvation is established through the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, shall we fling away ‘that form of doctrine’ which we received? … For myself, I pray that with this confession I may depart hence to the Lord, and them I charge to preserve the faith secure until the day of Christ, and to keep the Spirit undivided from the Father and the Son, preserving, both in the confession of faith and in the doxology [literally: ‘in the proclamation of the glory’], the doctrine taught them at their baptism. ( <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i> X.26; Basil of Caesarea 1983: 17) As Gregory of Nazianzus wrote a few years later ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.380): ‘Were the Spirit not to be worshipped, how could he deify me through baptism? If he is to be worshipped, why not adored? And if to be adored, how can he fail to be God? One links with the other, a truly golden chain of salvation’ ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 31.28; Gregory of Nazianzus 2002: 139). Generally speaking, the action of the divine Persons in our life indicates their divinity: ‘To sanctify men is the proper work of God, for Leviticus (22:32) says: “I am the Lord who sanctifies you”. It is, of course, the Holy Spirit who sanctifies, as the Apostle says: “You are washed, you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God” (1 Cor. 6:11)’ (Thomas Aquinas 1957: ch. 17, 108). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinitarian faith, baptism, and membership in the Church go together, as one can notice in the Creeds. Some summaries of faith appeared quite naturally in the early Church (the movement towards formulation is under way in the New Testament) because of the necessity to explain faith to persons interested or hostile. The various elements of the early formulas then led to the Trinitarian structure of Creeds such as the ‘Symbol of the Apostles’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">or the Creed of Nicaea (Kelly 1972). Especially in the context of baptism, the profession of faith expresses a double move: the individual goes to the Church, and faith comes from the Church to the believer. This dynamic interconnection is the object of a wide ecumenical agreement, and includes other sacraments: ‘In baptism a profession of faith is given according to the Trinitarian content of the faith of the community  <i class="calibre4">(regula fidei)</i> which is at the same time recognized by the community. The profession of faith occurs also in those churches which do not formally use the words of the Nicene Creed when baptismal confession uses other formulas authorized by the Church. Here, likewise, baptismal confession joins the faith of the baptized to the common faith of the Church through the Page 2 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> ages. The same faith is also expressed in the eucharistic liturgy by the confession of creeds’ (Faith and Order 1991: §15, 5). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Boris Bobrinskoy says about the connection Trinity—Church—Sacraments is therefore true not only of the Orthodox: ‘In the Orthodox understanding, it is not possible to comprehend the nature of liturgical action without constant reference to the Trinitarian mystery into which worship introduces the Christian. All worship is an ecclesial, and personal, celebration addressed to the Father, through Christ, in the Holy Spirit’ (Bobrinskoy 2008: 52). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 430) The Holy Spirit and the Body of Christ</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus Christ came to give life to his disciples. The gift of the life of the Head makes the community become the Body of Christ, and this can happen only through the sending of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The understanding of the relationship between the divine persons is a key to the understanding of the Church. More precisely: is there an order in the Trinity, and is that order reflected in the actions of the Son and the Holy Spirit in the ‘economy’, that is, in this world? Two examples illustrate such a connection. Some contemporary Orthodox theologians accuse both Catholics and Protestants of separating the action of the Holy Spirit from the action of Christ, by suggesting that the Holy Spirit can be present outside of the Body of Christ (Phidas 1993). In a ‘Notification’ on the interreligious theology of the Belgian Jesuit Jacques Dupuis, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith affirmed that ‘The Church's faith teaches that the Holy Spirit, working after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is always the Spirit of Christ sent by the Father, who works in a salvific way in Christians as well as non-Christians’ (Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith 2001, §5). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The theological views on the Trinity have therefore an immediate impact on the understanding of what the Church is, above all in ecumenical and interreligious questions. It is crucial to assess such a question in a non-polemical way. In the western Christianity, the influence of the controversies of the sixteenth century is a somehow hidden factor in this context, because the implicit ecclesiology of many theologians still presupposes views similar to that of St Robert Bellarmine. In order to react against what he perceived as a Calvinist insistence on the invisible aspect of the Church and a parallel underestimation of her visible aspect, the Jesuit Doctor tried to coin a minimal definition of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His main purpose was to provide a way of recognizing who does belong to the Church and who does not: ‘For anyone to be called in some sense a part of the true Church, of which the Scriptures speak, we do not think that any internal virtue is required, but only an external profession of faith and communication of the Sacraments, which can be perceived by the senses themselves. For the Church is an assembly of men, as visible and palpable as the assembly of the Roman people, or the Kingdom of France, or the Republic of the Venetians’ (Bellarmine 1857: 75). Writing before the polemical context of the Counter Reformation, Aquinas had a widely different view on the Church: ‘We must say that if we Page 3 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p453"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> take the whole time of the world in general, Christ is the Head of all human beings, but diversely’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.8, a.3). To say that Christ is ‘the Head of all human beings’ means that, in different ways, all human beings are members of the Church: for him, to be a member of the Church means to receive salvation. Christ the Head builds his Body (the Church) by offering the salvific grace to all human beings, although some do not accept it and are ‘members of the Church’ only in the sense that they are called to become members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Catholic Counter-Reformation theology seems outdated in an ecumenical age, some of its popular presuppositions are present within ecumenical views. An explicit rejection of the patristic-medieval ecclesiology (of which I took Aquinas as an  <b class="calibre3">(p. 431) </b>example) for the sake of dialogue can unwittingly hide Bellarminian views: ‘In recent decades, there has been a shift away from the patristic and scholastic custom of giving the word </p>
<p class="calibre1">“church” such a wide meaning that it included all who are being saved. The more restricted use of the term does not seek to deny the insights which the earlier usage conveyed, but rather to better serve the Church of today, with its keen awareness of the values inherent in other religions and in the world at large and its effort to work together with these others in order to realize more fully God's Kingdom’ (Henn 1997: 146). In this seemingly necessary view of dialogue with other religions, a Bellarminian definition of the Church is implicitly assumed as the only possible ecclesiology: ‘Church’ means a well-identified visible group and cannot mean anything else, although it did in the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same question has a more Christological form in Jacques Dupuis’ theology of religions. He suggests in careful terms a hypothesis about the role of the incarnation in the salvific work of the Son: ‘Admittedly, in the mystery of Jesus-the-Christ, the Word cannot be separated from the flesh it has assumed. But, inseparable as the divine Word and Jesus’ human existence may be, they nevertheless remain distinct. While, then, the human action of the Logos ensarkos is the universal sacrament of God's saving action, it does not exhaust the action of the Logos. A distinct action of the Logos asarkos endures—not, to be sure, as constituting a distinct economy of salvation, parallel to that realized in the flesh of Christ, but as the expression of God's superabundant graciousness and absolute freedom’ (Dupuis 1997: 299). Here again, Aquinas had a different view: ‘To give grace or the Holy Spirit belongs to Christ as He is God, authoritatively; but instrumentally it belongs also to Him as man, inasmuch as His manhood is the instrument of His Godhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And hence by the power of the Godhead His actions were beneficial, i.e. by causing grace in us’ ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.8, a.1, ad1). For Thomas, the assumed humanity cannot be an obstacle to the Son's granting of grace. Both positions want to take into account the Christological definition of Chalcedon, in a particular way that ‘at no point was the difference between the natures taken away through the union, but rather the property of both natures is preserved and comes together into a single person’ (Council of Chalcedon (451), in Tanner 1990: vol. 1, *86). Certainly the human nature of Christ implies a limitation, but is it such that the Son would have to act in part as if he would not have assumed that nature? It seems that Dupuis replies yes, and Thomas no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p454"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> In other words, the question raised by ‘the patristic and scholastic custom’ to—especially</p>
<p class="calibre1">—our theories of interreligious dialogue is: does the Incarnation limit the action of the Son of God in such a way that He would be able to build his Body within only part of humanity? For the other human beings, the Holy Spirit—or the Son, but not as incarnate—</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have a salvific role more or less distinct from the one of the incarnate Son. If the Son needs to put his Incarnation aside in order to take seriously all of us, then was the incarnation a divine mistake? If the Holy Spirit acts outside the Body of Christ, is it true that ‘When the Counsellor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me’ (Jn 15:26), or that ‘He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you’ (Jn 16:14)? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 432) </b>In broader terms, the understanding of the relationship between the action of the Holy Spirit and the Body of Christ leads—more or less consciously—to different ecclesiologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ninth General Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC) issued an ecclesiological Statement with explicit Trinitarian and sacramental content: Our common belonging to Christ through baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit enables and calls churches to walk together, even when they are in disagreement. We affirm that there is one baptism, just as there is one body and one Spirit, one hope of our calling, one Lord, one faith, one God and Father of us all. (World Council of Churches 2006: §III.9, 115) The Holy Spirit helps our discernment in cases of differences: Some differences express God's grace and goodness; they must be discerned in God's grace through the Holy Spirit. Other differences divide the Church; these must be overcome through the Spirit's gifts of faith, hope, and love. (World Council of Churches 2006: §II.5, 114) The relationship between each member church of the WCC and the one Church confessed in the Creed is also mentioned: ‘Each church is the Church catholic and not simply a part of it. Each church is the Church catholic, but not the whole of it. Each church fulfils its catholicity when it is in communion with the other churches’ (World Council of Churches 2006: §II.6, 114). But the question of the relationship between the action of the incarnate Son and the action of the Holy Spirit in the context of Church membership is not developed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the WCC, that question has been raised by the Orthodox members of the World Council of Churches, taking into consideration Orthodox and Protestant views: Within the two basic ecclesiological starting points there is in fact a certain range of views on the relation of the Church to the churches. This existing range invites us to pose to one another the following questions. To the Orthodox: ‘Is there space for other churches in Orthodox ecclesiology? How would this space and its limits be described?’ To the churches within the tradition of the Reformation: ‘How does Page 5 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p455"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> your church understand, maintain and express your belonging to the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church?’ (‘Final Report of the Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC’ 2003: §16, 7) The possibility for other churches to have a space in Orthodox ecclesiology depends on (1) the impossibility for the Holy Spirit to act outside of the Body of Christ; (2) a tendency to identify the Body of Christ and the Orthodox Church. The parallel question is asked by the Orthodox to the Protestants, in terms that could be rephrased to become: you disagree with our ‘exclusive’ ecclesiology, but then, what does ‘Church unity’ mean in your broad understanding of the Church? Some space might be opened in relation to the exclusiveness because of the Orthodox insistence on the  <i class="calibre4">lex orandi, lex credendi</i> principle. The 7th Canon of the first Council of Constantinople (accepted in the East) does not require the baptism of all heretics who become Orthodox, but of some only: <b class="calibre3">(p. 433)</b> Those who embrace orthodoxy and join the number of those who are being saved from the heretics, we receive in the following regular and customary manner: Arians, Macedonians, Sabbatians, Novatians … These we receive when they hand in statements and anathematise every heresy … They are first sealed or anointed with holy chrism on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth and ears. As we seal them we say: ‘Seal of the gift of the holy Spirit’. But Eunomians …, Montanists …, Sabellians … On the first day we make Christians of them, on the second catechumens, on the third we exorcise them … and then we baptise them’. (Tanner 1990: vol. 1, </p>
<p class="calibre1">*35). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a matter of fact, most Orthodox churches affirm that the Church is the Orthodox Church, that sacraments are administered only in the Church, and that some non- Orthodox Christians do not have to be baptized again, if they become Orthodox. The Great Orthodox theologian Georges Florovsky commented on that practice: ‘Nobody would dare to receive a Moslem into the Church without baptism “by economy”. Why should we receive non-Orthodox by a more lenient way, if they were really just like “heathen men”?’ (Florovsky 1950: 150–60). He interprets this situation with an explicit reference to the Catholic Church, in a partial anticipation of Vatican II: ‘The Church of Rome would not recognise any separated Christian body as a “church”, but does regard the separated as Christians—they are somehow and really related to and connected with the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are degrees of Church membership’ (Florovsky 1950: 160; see also Arjakovsky 2006: 276). Nevertheless, Florovsky had a strong view on the unity between divine action and the Church:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The work of the Spirit in believers is precisely their incorporation into Christ, their baptism into one body … By the Spirit Christians are united with Christ, are united in Him, are constituted into His Body.  <i class="calibre4">One body</i>, that of Christ … The incarnation is being completed in the Church. And, in a certain sense, the Church is Christ Himself, in His all-embracing plenitude. (Florovsky 1972: 63–4) Page 6 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> Even if baptism is considered to be valid only in the case of the ones who become Orthodox (as in Phidas 1993), it would still mean that some divine action happens outside the recognized boundaries of the Orthodox Church. Archbishop Chrysostomos of Cyprus used the argument of mixed weddings in a similar way, when he received the Commission of dialogue between Orthodox and Catholics, 18 October 2009: if the Orthodox Church accepts common prayer during mixed weddings, it means that the non-Orthodox member of the couple can be part in an Orthodox liturgy (non-published text, personal witness of the author of this contribution). To be part in an Orthodox liturgy means some sharing in the Church's life. The challenge is then to explain how some spiritual membership is related to the visible Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Catholic Church, one of the main tasks of Vatican II was to understand how baptized non-Catholics were members of the Church. The solution found in the Constitution <i class="calibre4">Lumen Gentium</i> (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church) of that Council is the famous  <i class="calibre4">subsistit in</i>: This is the unique church of Christ, which in the Creed we profess to be one, holy, catholic and apostolic. After his resurrection our saviour gave the church to Peter to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 434) </b>feed …, and to him and the other apostles he committed the church to be governed and spread …, and he set it up for all time as the pillar and foundation of the truth…. This church, set up and organized in this world as a society, subsists in the catholic church, governed by the successor of Peter and the bishops in communion with him, although outside its structure many elements of sanctification and of truth are to be found which, as proper gifts to the church of Christ, impel towards catholic unity. ( <i class="calibre4">Lumen Gentium</i> §8, in Tanner 1990: vol. 2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">*854)</p>
<p class="calibre1">This teaching has been reasserted and explained by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2007 (see Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith 2007). Although this seems to be a purely ecclesiological question, it involves a theology of the Trinity, since </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the Church appears as “a people made one by the unity of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit” ( <i class="calibre4">Lumen Gentium</i> §2; in Tanner 1990: vol. 2, *851). The unity of the Church implies that the actions of Christ and of the Spirit are ‘co-ordinated’: Christ is the Head of this body…. In order that we may be continually renewed in him …, he gave us a share in his Spirit, who is one and the same in head and members. This Spirit gives life, unity and movement to the whole body, so that the fathers of the church could compare his task to that which is exercised by the life-principle, the soul, in the human body’. ( <i class="calibre4">Lumen Gentium</i> §7; in Tanner 1990: vol. 2, </p>
<p class="calibre1">*853–4)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is possible in such a perspective to say that the Holy Spirit acts without the boundaries of the Catholic Church (understood in ‘Bellarminian’ terms), while asserting at the same time that what is outside these boundaries is somehow within, because of the unifying action of the Holy Spirit: Page 7 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> The separated churches and communities as such, though we believe them to be deficient in some respects, have by no means been deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation. For the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation whose efficacy comes from that fullness of grace and truth which has been entrusted to the catholic church. (Council Vatican II, Decree  <i class="calibre4">Unitatis Redintegratio</i> on ecumenism, §3; in Tanner 1990: *910) Not too surprisingly, such texts lead to different interpretations, insisting rather on ‘the </p>
<p class="calibre1">“others” are within the Church’ or on ‘the Holy Spirit also acts elsewhere’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A solution to the ‘without but within’ question has been proposed by Swiss cardinal Charles Journet and his ‘principle of coextensivity’ of body and soul (Morerod 2008: 96–</p>
<p class="calibre1">103). Taking the Holy Spirit as the soul of the Church, Journet explains that wherever the Spirit acts and is received, the body of the Church at least starts being present: ‘Where appears something of the soul of the Church, there appears something of the body of the Church’ (Journet 2000: 1557). This is the case even when people do not realize (or do not realize yet) that they are acting under the motion of the Holy Spirit. Such people have at least an implicit desire, an initial love of God, and ‘tend, without even noticing it, to exteriorise their desire…. It will be possible to speak, about these just, of an invisible membership in the visible Church’ (Journet 2000: 1558). They would be, in an incomplete way, members of the Church, because the action of the Holy Spirit builds the Body of Christ: the impact of the Spirit produces an effect in the life of the persons, and in this sense the Church is already  <b class="calibre3">(p. 435) </b>visible. But since this is not conscious, such a membership is both visible (in itself) and invisible (to the persons involved). This is only one first step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Journet, in the case of people who do not know that they are replying to the Holy Spirit, ‘the Church can exist, not of course in its normal and completed state, but in a rudimentary or, rather, abnormal and restricted state’ (Journet 1960: 118). The good already received, the initial love of God—because it is love—asks for more. If the initial membership would become explicit—through the confession of faith and the reception of the sacraments—then these persons ‘would be like a rose-tree kept for a long time in an unsuitable climate which, suddenly transplanted to a sunny region, can show of what it is capable and blossom to the full’ (Journet 1960: 124). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides the ‘within but without’ question, the Catholic teaching expressed in the expression ‘ <i class="calibre4">subsistit in</i>’ raises an ecumenical question sharply summarized by the German Protestant theologian Eberhard Jüngel: ‘Why must the Church of Jesus Christ subsist in this world in a precise way [ <i class="calibre4">ausgerechnet</i>]?’ (Jüngel 2001: 60). Debates about this question usually focus on ministry or ecclesial structures, and this is useful, because the sacraments must be identified in a rather precise way. But it would be good to add to the studies on ‘structures’ some consideration about the relationship between the action of the Holy Spirit and the action of the incarnate Son edifying his Body. In other words, one of the most delicate ecclesiological questions is also and perhaps above all a question of Trinitarian theology. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> <b class="calibre3">Communion of the Trinity and Communion of </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">the Church</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The origin of the unity of the Church is commonly placed in the communion of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a clear example of this in the Decree on Ecumenism of the second Vatican Council: This is the sacred mystery of the unity of the church, in Christ and through Christ, while the action of the Holy Spirit produces a variety of gifts. It is a mystery that finds its highest model and source in the unity of the persons of the Trinity: the unity of the one God, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. (Council Vatican II, Decree  <i class="calibre4">Unitatis Redintegratio</i> §2; in Tanner 1990: *909) The parallel between a human community and the Trinity is used to speak of different types of human communion:</p>
<p class="calibre1">God is love and in Himself He lives a mystery of personal loving communion. Creating the human race in His own image and continually keeping it in being, God inscribed in the humanity of man and woman the vocation, and thus the capability and responsibility, of love and communion. Love is therefore the fundamental and innate vocation of every human being. (John Paul II 1981 (§11): 3) The comparison between the unity of the Trinity and the unity of the Church (or another human community) may be approached from both ends of the comparison. If we  <b class="calibre3">(p. 436)</b> approach it from the Church's end, we run the risk (although this is not the aim of texts such as we have just quoted) of promoting an unconscious tritheism. St Augustine was well aware of the danger:</p>
<p class="calibre1">They do not seem to me to offer a probable opinion, who believe that, with regard to human nature, a trinity of the image of God in three persons can be so found, so as to be completed in the marriage of the man and woman with their offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> XII.5; Augustine 1963: 346)</p>
<p class="calibre1">He explains that the theologian ‘may not take with him to the highest things that which he loathes in the lowest things’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> XII.5; Augustine 1963: 347). ‘We ought, therefore, not to understand man as made to the image of the exalted Trinity, that is, to the image of God, in such a way that the same image is understood to be in three human beings’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> XII.7; Augustine 1963: 351). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the risk involved in the approach that speaks of God starting with this world, we should try to see not only the Trinity from our experience of the Church, but also the Church from the perspective of the Trinity: this is actually the correct order, although it is not the first one in the order of our discovery. St Thomas Aquinas does exactly that, if one considers the consequences of what he says about divine love and divine knowledge: ‘The Father with the same love, which is the Holy Spirit, loves himself, the Son, the Holy Spirit and all creatures. Even so by the same Word, which is the Son, he utters himself, the Son, Page 9 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p459"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> the Holy Spirit and all creatures’ ( <i class="calibre4">De Potentia</i>, q.9, a.9, ad13; Thomas Aquinas 1934: 163). What is the relation of the Father to the Church? The Father sees the Son with the Church (his Body), the  <i class="calibre4">Christus totus</i>. See, for instance, Augustine's  <i class="calibre4">Enarrationes in</i> <i class="calibre4">Psalmos</i> 74.4: ‘totus Christus, caput, et corpus’ (Augustine 1956: 1027). The same teaching is found in Aquinas: ‘totus Christus, idest ecclesia et caput ejus’ (Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">Commentary on Psalm 3</i>, no. 5; Thomas Aquinas 1813: 157). And the Spirit, common love of the Father and the Son, unites the Church to the Father and the Son, and the members are united among them ‘through the operation of the Holy Spirit, who unites the Church together, and communicates the goods of one member to another’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.68, a.9, ad2). The communication of the goods is the work of charity, which ‘can be in us neither naturally, nor through acquisition by the natural powers, but by the infusion of the Holy Spirit, Who is the love of the Father and the Son, and the participation of Whom in us is created charity’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> II-II, q.24, a.2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such a view is in no way surprising if one considers that for Aquinas Church membership is conferred by grace. And sanctifying grace, participation in divine life, comes from the Head of the Body (Christ) through the Holy Spirit. Grace and Church membership are by nature Trinitarian. Emery summarizes this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adoptive sonship makes human beings kin to the Word from within the oneness which he has with the Father…. Brought about by assimilation to the Son, the oneness of the Church is thus seen as a participation in the oneness of the Trinity…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ‘participation’ in which filial adoption consists is a divinization or deification, for Thomas conceives grace as precisely an ‘assimilation’ or ‘participation in the divine nature’, a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 437) </b>new creation which God alone can bring about. By affiliating human beings to the Son, adoptive Sonship affiliates them to his divine Sonship of the Father. Grace is thus a ‘participation of the divine nature’…. This rebirth is brought about by the gift of the Holy Spirit …. From this gift, rooted in the eternal filiation of the Son of God, the whole Christian life is projected. (Emery 2007: 207–8)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words: ‘I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me’ (Jn 17:22–</p>
<p class="calibre1">3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Christ and the Holy Spirit in the Sacraments</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Baptism is the most explicitly ‘Trinitarian’ sacrament, already in the New Testament itself (Matt. 28:19), but all sacraments provide good opportunities to look at the relationship between the actions of the divine Persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ministers of the sacraments are not always saints. And even when they are, they still cannot give grace—divinization—thanks to their own moral standards. Sacraments exist only because Christ acts in them through his ministers, and this happens thanks to the ac</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p460"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> tion in the ministers of the Holy Spirit who first descended on Christ and then was sent by him to his disciples. This is what St Augustine summarizes: Although many ministers, be they righteous or unrighteous, should baptize, the virtue of baptism would be attributed to Him alone on whom the dove descended, and of whom it was said, ‘This is He that baptizes with the Holy Spirit’? Peter may baptize, but this is He [Christ] that baptizes ( <i class="calibre4">Petrus baptizet, hic est qui baptizat</i>); Paul may baptize, yet this is He that baptizes; Judas may baptize, still this is He that baptizes. ( <i class="calibre4">Tractatus in Johannis Evangelium</i> VI.7; Augustine 1954: 57) This teaching was widely accepted by different Christian denominations, such as the Church of England:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness [of the ministers], nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men. (Article XXVI in  <i class="calibre4">The Book of Common Prayer</i> 1815: 401)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sacraments do not exist without the Holy Spirit: ‘The water of Baptism does not cause any spiritual effect by reason of the water, but by reason of the power of the Holy Spirit, which power is in the water’ (Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.73, a.1, ad2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relationship between the roles of the incarnate Son and of the Holy Spirit in the Eucharist has been a matter of ecumenical debate. In the western Christianity, the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 438)</b> accent has been put on the words of institution of Jesus Christ, using elements of 1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">11:23–5, Matt. 26:26–9, Mk 14:22–5, and Lk. 22:14–20. In the eastern Christianity, the accent has been put on the invocation of the Holy Spirit. It is clear to most theologians that both elements should be somehow present, together with some human action. What will probably be remembered as the most important twentieth-century ecumenical document on the sacraments— <i class="calibre4">Baptism, Eucharist, Ministry</i> (known as  <i class="calibre4">BEM</i>, Faith and Order document 1982)—showed in a balanced way the Trinitarian dimension of the Eucharistic celebration: The Spirit makes the crucified and risen Christ really present to us in the eucharistic meal, fulfilling the promise contained in the words of institution. The presence of Christ is clearly the centre of the eucharist, and the promise contained in the words of institution is therefore fundamental to the celebration. Yet it is the Father who is the primary origin and final fulfilment of the eucharistic event. The incarnate Son of God by and in whom it is accomplished is its living centre. The Holy Spirit is the immeasurable strength of love which makes it possible and continues to make it effective. The bond between the eucharistic celebration and the mystery of the Triune God reveals the role of the Holy Spirit as that of the One who makes the historical words of Jesus present and alive. Being assured by Jesus’ promise in the words of institution that it will be answered, the Church prays to the Father for the gift of the Holy Spirit in order that the eucharistic Page 11 of 15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p461"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity, the Church, and the Sacraments</b> event may be a reality: the real presence of the crucified and risen Christ giving his life for all humanity. ( <i class="calibre4">BEM</i> 1982: part on the Eucharist, §14) The balanced character of  <i class="calibre4">BEM</i>'s summary is useful, as even some misunderstandings in the reception show. The Lutheran Church of the Netherlands officially replied to that part of  <i class="calibre4">BEM</i>:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our main objection is to §14. In it the Holy Spirit's office is elevated to that of a mediating agent; as being someone necessary for the ‘realis presentia Christi’ and the fulfilment of the ‘promise in the words of institution’…. In the outline of the liturgy also the Holy Spirit is a ‘conditio sine qua non’. In our view, however, the sacrament is governed neither by the ministry nor the Spirit, but solely by the word. (Thurian 1988: 21)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The importance of the reply of a Church that has a limited number of theologians (the Lutherans are a small minority in Holland) should not be overestimated, but it shows the lasting impact of different historical accents on different aspects of Trinitarian theology in the theology of the sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">BEM</i> actually provides a synthesis of the action and presence of God in the Church and in the sacraments:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> the Father is the primary origin and final fulfilment; <b class="calibre3">(2)</b> the presence of Christ is the centre: this applies in a specific way to the Eucharist, but also to any sacrament, and to the Church as Body of Christ; <b class="calibre3">(3)</b> the Holy Spirit makes the presence of the crucified and risen Christ possible and effective. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 439) </b>The sacrament of confirmation is historically complex. Aquinas himself mentions </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘contemporary’ questions about its institution ( <i class="calibre4">ST</i> III, q.72, a.1, ad1). The Reformers did not count it as a sacrament strictly speaking. Contemporary research, when it tries to understand confirmation as a sacrament, provides interesting hints about the action of the Holy Spirit in Christian life:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We must be empowered by the Spirit for this maturation in the faith, for this living out of our baptismal vows. Insofar as it is a sacramental rite, confirmation reminds us that, here as elsewhere, our acts are never simply ours independently of God's acts for us. We must seek comfort and succour from the Spirit in the difficult effort to be what baptism has already made us. (Tanner 2006: 89) Confirmation can show the link between the ‘immanent’ and the ‘economical’ roles of the Holy Spirit: ‘The Spirit is the one who binds us to Christ just as the Spirit joins Father and Son by bonds of affection. But the Spirit is also the one who brings to fruition or completion what the Father starts and the Son takes up’ (Tanner 2006: 90). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This article examines the relation between Trinity and salvation. It analyzes the issue of Christian life as an existence in the Trinity through a close reading of selected biblical texts that touch directly on our relationship with the Father, the Son, and/or the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The analysis indicates that the doctrine of the Trinity has everything to do with the topic of salvation and with the way of life that Christians are summoned to. It argues that faith and the sacraments bring about real transformation through the indwelling of the Spirit and adoptive sonship in the Son, so that Christians already live in the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinity, salvation, Christian life, biblical texts, sacraments, indwelling of the Spirit Therefore since we are made lovers of God by the Holy Spirit, and every beloved is in the lover as such, by the Holy Spirit necessarily the Father and the Son dwell in us also (Jn 14:23; 1 Jn 3:24)…. Therefore, by the Holy Spirit not only is God in us, but we are also in God (1 Jn 4:13, 16). </p>
