<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b> <b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When faced with the topic, ‘Christian life as an existence in the Trinity’, it is difficult to know where to begin. Given the eruption of attempts in recent decades to relate the doctrine of the Trinity to all facets of human life and endeavour, the potential field for exploration is immensely broad. Karl Barth's praiseworthy determination to make the reality of the Trinitarian God the centre of his exposition of the Christian faith has provoked an impressive response in the generations of scholars and theologians who followed him—</p>
<p class="calibre1">though it is doubtful that he would have been pleased with many of their claims and conclusions. Karl Rahner's call to make Christian faith and life truly Trinitarian has found an Page 1 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p466"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> enthusiastic response from authors determined to ensure that all discussion of Christian life bear a Trinitarian shape (Grentz 2004: 33–71; Letham 2004). </p>
<p class="calibre1">But one wonders—when surveying these efforts—if many of them have not become unmoored from the very reality they so ardently labour to apply. Caught up in the enthusiasm to make the Trinity applicable and relevant to any and every aspect of Christian life, they sometimes too readily select and appropriate one aspect of  <b class="calibre3">(p. 443) </b>Trinitarian doctrine to the detriment of others, thus diminishing or deforming the doctrine of the Trinity itself (Johnson 2007: 332). Moreover, some Christian theologians have uncritically accepted caricatures of patristic or medieval Trinitarian theology, and readily make use of these caricatures to build up their own accounts (Ayres 2004: 384). Sometimes it is the entire patristic era that comes under fire for its presumed Hellenistic-substantialist deformation of the biblical revelation (Alston 2004), but more commonly it is the line of western Trinitarian thought running from Augustine through Aquinas to the present that receives the sharpest critique. Trinitarian scholarship in the past decade has persuasively argued that the commonly-held assumptions about western and eastern Trinitarian theologies are seriously flawed, and that a reassessment of how the history of Trinitarian theology is typically understood and taught is needed (Barnes 2004; Ayres 2004: 384–435). Judging that much Trinitarian speculation has lost its moorings in the Scripture and is prone to overstatement, Alister McGrath makes a plea for ‘a trinitarian modesty’ (McGrath 2006: 26, 32). Similarly, Lewis Ayres commends a return to the ‘great austerity’ practised in the fourth century when describing the divine persons or making use of Trinitarian analogies (Ayres 2004: 418). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Efforts to make the Trinitarian God of revelation central to all Christian faith and practice are to be applauded. And it would seem entirely fitting that Christian thinkers ‘search and enquire carefully’ into how Christian life in this age may more fully reflect the Trinitarian God whose life we have come to share. Augustine himself would approve (in principle) on the basis of ‘faith seeking understanding’. But great care must be taken to ensure that we don’t distort the revelation of the Trinitarian God in the very efforts to appropriate and apply that doctrine. Deeply aware of the inherent limitations of human words and created analogies, Trinitarian theology should seek to articulate and engage the full revelation of Father, Son, and Spirit, firmly grounded in the Scriptures that reveal this triune God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Convinced of this, I will address the topic of ‘Christian life as an existence in the Trinity’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">by means of a close reading of selected biblical texts—coming principally from Paul and John—that touch directly on our relationship with the Father, the Son, and/or the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This reading, however, makes no pretence to be pre-theological or pre-dogmatic. Any attempt to display the work of the ‘economic Trinity’ is the end-result of a process that has already taken in and meditated upon the biblical texts, and come to an understanding (even preliminary) about the ‘immanent Trinity’ (God in himself,  <i class="calibre4">in se</i>). Gilles Emery makes this point with great clarity:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the economic Trinity is no less speculative than that of the immanent Trinity. The revelation of the Trinity by its works is admittedly first in the or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p467"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> der of our discovery of the mystery. But the doctrine of the economic Trinity is not only the starting point of a theological reflection: it is rather the last fruit of a reflection founded in the speculative reading of the documents of revelation, when doctrinal speculative principles are applied to the agency of the persons as taught by Scriptures…. In this way Trinitarian theology moves from Scripture to Scripture (Emery 2006: 294). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 444) </b>By moving from ‘Scripture to Scripture’ I hope to draw out some of the implications for ‘Christian life as an existence in the Trinity’ that pertain to our destiny as creatures who live by participation in the one divine life of the Father, Son, and Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before moving to an investigation of the biblical texts, some mention should be made about the relationship between the primary terms of the title, ‘Trinity’ and ‘salvation’. It is quite common to hear the claim that the early Church debates over the Trinity and the Incarnation were largely detached from the central issue of Christian salvation. On this account, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed and the Chalcedonian Definition had little correlation to soteriology as such. This view is normally buttressed by the further assertion that the early Church councils simply did not dogmatize any doctrine of salvation, and so left this topic ‘undefined’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is true that the early Church offered no defined theory of the atonement (how exactly Christ saved us). But to conclude from this that the debates over the full divinity and full humanity of the Son (and the full divinity of the Spirit) were only tangential to an understanding of salvation is profoundly mistaken. These debates were heated and prolonged precisely because the issue of salvation was seen to be at stake (Young 1991: 80). For those engaged in these debates, if Jesus was not truly and fully God, then we are not saved. If he did not assume our full humanity, then our humanity has not been fully redeemed. If the Spirit of God is not fully divine then we are not brought into real participation with the divine life—and our salvation is endangered. This inherent connection between Trinity and salvation also marks the approach of Thomas Aquinas, who states that the principle reason why knowledge of the divine persons is necessary ‘is to give us a true notion of the salvation of mankind, a salvation accomplished by the Son who became flesh and by the gift of the Holy Spirit’ (Thomas Aquinas,  <i class="calibre4">ST</i> I, q.32, a.1, ad3). The doctrine of the Trinity, then, has everything to do with the topic of salvation and with the way of life that Christians are summoned to. Given that I cannot hope to address even a fraction of the ways in which the Trinity relates to salvation, I will limit myself to consider how Christian salvation includes and is ordered to ‘life in the Trinity’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">The Biblical Witness to Life in the Trinity</b> <b class="calibre3">Matthew 28:19–20 and Christian Baptism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The obvious biblical starting point is the section that closes Matthew's gospel: ‘Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p468"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age’ (Matt. 28:19–20, NRSV). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This text was not only decisive in the early Church for ensuring that the Christian understanding of God would be Trinitarian, it also confirmed that incorporation into the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 445)</b> Christian community was to be in terms of the Father, Son, and Spirit. In this text the three persons are governed, as it were, by one instance of the word, ‘name’. There are not three names, but one name—and that one name is ‘the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit’. It is as if the one name of God has been expanded to include the three persons without losing its oneness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Christ's final commission in Matthew, all nations are to be evangelized and discipled—the inclusion of the Gentiles is quite clear in this context. And a key part of this process is their baptism into the one name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Matthew does not develop here what it means to be baptized into the three persons. Yet it is clear that disciples of Christ—Jew and Gentile alike—are to live their lives ‘within’ the Trinity in some sense. Becoming a Christian is marked by inclusion through baptism into the Father, Son, and Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Paul, Acts, and 1 Peter new features of Christian baptism are displayed, tied more directly to the work of the Son and the Spirit. For Paul, to be baptized into Christ (Gal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3:27) means that we are spiritually joined to Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4). We pass through the process of dying and rising spiritually with Christ in order ‘to walk in newness of life’. For its part, Acts testifies with special emphasis to the gift of the Spirit given in baptism (Acts 1:5; 2:38). Christ is the one who baptizes, not with water only, but with the Holy Spirit—this is the distinctive mark of Christian baptism. Paul too speaks of being baptized ‘in one Spirit’ and ‘made to drink of one Spirit’ (1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">12:13). Peter explicitly ties baptism to our salvation: ‘And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ’ (1 Pet. 3:21). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What these witnesses make clear is that Christian baptism—joined with repentance, faith, and confession—into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit is not merely a cultic formula and rite but a genuine transformation through living contact with God himself. Christians experience ‘salvation’ through the saving work of the Father, Son, and Spirit, dying and rising with Christ and receiving the dynamic presence of the Spirit within. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Witness of Paul</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is clear that for Paul (and here I am including all the Pauline letters) the Christian life can be understood only in terms of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Sometimes he accents the work of just one person (Father, Son, or Spirit), at other times he includes all three. But he is never far from presenting salvation and the Christian life as a participation in God (Father, Son, and Spirit). The doxology that closes 2 Corinthians demonstrates the distinct yet united activity of the three persons in the Christian community: ‘The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p469"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> you’ (2 Cor. 13:14). A brief line from Ephesians shows that access to God has a distinctively Trinitarian shape: ‘For through him [Christ] both of us [Jew and Gentile] have access in one Spirit to the Father’ (Eph. 2:18). This highly compressed sentence shows the distinctive yet united work of the three persons. It is through the work of Christ, <b class="calibre3">(p. 446)</b> redeeming and uniting both Jew and Gentile in his one body, and in the Spirit who sanctifies and empowers us, that we now have access to the presence of God the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning to Paul's treatment of the Holy Spirit, it is plain that Christian salvation includes the effective indwelling of the Spirit in the believer. Paul makes use of the term ‘pour out’—commonly found to express the gift of the Spirit (Acts 2:17–18, 33; 10:45; 22:20; Titus 3:5–6)—to state how the love of God has been imparted to us through the personal gift of the Spirit: ‘God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us’ (Rom. 5:5). The giver is given along with the gift. The bodily location of this indwelling is underlined in 1 Corinthians when Paul argues for the importance of holiness and purity in Christian practice: Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? … </p>
<p class="calibre1">For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple…. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? (1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3:16–17; 6:19)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul's statement of mutual indwelling is quite striking. It is the Spirit who comes to dwell </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘in us’, but at the same time we also come to live ‘in the Spirit’: ‘But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you’ (Rom. 8:9; see also Eph. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2:22). For Paul, the life and activity of the Christian community is so clearly located ‘in the Spirit’ that he can warn the Thessalonians not to ‘quench the Spirit’ (1 Thess. 5:19), and can exhort the Ephesians not to ‘grieve the Holy Spirit of God’ through destructive patterns of speech (Eph. 4:30). Since the Spirit of God lives in them (and they live ‘in the Spirit’), offences against one another ‘grieve’ the Spirit of God and diminish the Spirit's governing influence among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is equally clear that, for Paul, the Christian life (and its final end) is defined in terms of the person of Christ, the Son. The Father's purpose in creating and redeeming the human race was so that we might be conformed to the Son himself: ‘For those whom he [the Father] foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brethren’ (Rom. 8:29, RSV). The Son is not just the one who ‘saves’ us from our enemies or who is the model that we follow—he is also the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘image’ to which we are to be conformed. In a similar vein Paul writes to the Corinthians that they ‘are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another’ (2 Cor. 3:18). What Paul means by this becomes clearer in his personal statement of adherence to Christ when addressing the Galatians: ‘It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me’ (Gal. 2:20). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p470"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> Once again we encounter here the language of mutual indwelling, this time in reference to the person of the Son. Paul can claim that Christ lives ‘in him’, but also that we—on the far side of baptism—should consider ourselves ‘dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus’ (Rom. 6:11), and that ‘there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus’ (Rom. 8:1). He goes so far as to say that ‘if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come’ (2 Cor. 5:17, RSV). From these texts we can see that, for Paul, indwelling grounds ethics. It is because Christ <b class="calibre3">(p. 447) </b>has come to live in us (and we in Christ)—and because the Spirit has come to dwell in us (and we in the Spirit)—that we are called and enabled to live a peaceful, holy life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not only ethics that are grounded by the indwelling of God, but also mission. Paul consistently speaks of his ministry in terms of the power of the Spirit (Rom. 15:8–9; 1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2:4) and a sharing in the sufferings of Christ. In a text admittedly difficult to untangle, Paul presents his apostolic ministry as a kind of participation in the suffering and dying and rising of Christ:</p>
<p class="calibre1">[we are] always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies. For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be made visible in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you. (2 Cor. 4:10–12) It would not be too bold to see in this an application by Paul of baptism into Christ's death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4), now applied to the work of ministry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In two final texts under consideration, Paul brings all three persons into view together and displays their distinct yet united work. Recounting to the Christians in Rome the new life in the Spirit that Christians have attained, he writes: For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’ it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ—if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. (Rom. 8:14–17) The Spirit now living within us is a spirit of ‘sonship’ (adoption)—it witnesses within us that we have now become the sons and daughters of the Father. But this is not without reference to Christ, the true Son. We are ‘joint heirs’ with him and share in his sonship—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and are called to conform ourselves to his suffering. The climax of this work of the Spirit is the cry (and prayer) produced within us, ‘Abba, Father’. For Paul, the hope in which ‘we were saved’ (Rom. 8:24) includes at its centre our adoption through the Spirit as the children of the Father, as joint heirs with Christ the Son, enabling us to call upon the Father freely in respectful yet intimate terms, destined for conformity to Christ and the full redemption of our bodies in the resurrection (Rom. 8:22–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p471"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> In Ephesians 3, the doxology that closes the chapter offers prayer directly to the Father, asking that the Spirit may strengthen our ‘inner being’ with power, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts, yielding a knowledge of the love of Christ that surpasses all knowledge: For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith … and </p>
<p class="calibre1">[that you may] know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. (Eph. 3:14–17a, 19) <b class="calibre3">(p. 448) </b>In this prayer, the three persons are both the means and the end. It is the Father working through the Spirit that produces the full ‘dwelling’ of Christ in us. And the goal: to be ‘filled with the fullness of God’. Here in short is the Christian doctrine of deification. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Paul's prayer makes plain is that this call to be filled with God himself possesses a clear Trinitarian shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Witness of John</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For John's account of ‘Christian life as an existence in the Trinity’, we will look primarily at selections from the Final Discourse (Jn 14–17), and then examine a few key texts from the First Letter of John. Given that the selections directly pertaining to the Trinity are interwoven into the whole fabric of the Final Discourse, I will attempt to explain them with an eye to their wider context (though without being able to do full justice either to the selections themselves or the wider context). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Philip's question to Jesus, ‘Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied’ (Jn 14:8), provides the opening for Jesus’ description of his relationship to the Father: Jesus said to him, ‘Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, “Show us the Father?” Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves’. (Jn 14:9–11) The central truth present here is the mutual indwelling of Jesus and the Father. Each is </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘in’ the other in such a way that when we ‘see’ Jesus we are also seeing the Father. Plainly for John to ‘see’ Jesus is not just a matter of natural human vision—it is to see him with eyes of faith, and to recognize him as the very Word and Son of God made flesh. But we should note the place of ‘works’ in this recognition. Jesus seems to be saying to Philip that Jesus’ own testimony to this mutual indwelling should suffice, but he recognizes that it may not be enough to convince Philip and the others. The works Jesus does provide the added testimony that should bring conviction. The result of the Father dwelling in Jesus is that he will do divine works that testify to their mutual interrelationship and indwelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p472"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> This will be significant for human participation in the Trinity as well—it is through the works we do and the fruit we bear that we demonstrate our ‘existence in the Trinity’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Discourse proceeds, Jesus astonishingly expands his statement on mutual indwelling to include the disciples themselves: ‘On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you…. If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him’ (Jn 14:20, 23). The natural implication of this chain of relationships—‘I am in the Father, you in me, I in you’—is that the disciples are also ‘in’ the Father as a consequence of being ‘in’ the Son. The corollary of this is then made explicit in v. 23, where Jesus says that by virtue of the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 449) </b>disciple loving him and keeping his word, both the Father and the Son will come and make their home in that disciple. Once again, the statement on mutual indwelling is striking—but now the disciples are brought fully within this mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the Spirit is not mentioned explicitly here, the disciples have already been told in the same discourse that the Spirit would be given to dwell within them: ‘And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you for ever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you’ (Jn 14:16–17). It is this Spirit who, through this abiding presence, ‘will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you’ (Jn 14:26). It is not unreasonable to conclude that it is precisely through this gift of the abiding Spirit that the Father and Son will come to make their home in the disciples. Though not stated explicitly here, confirmation that the indwelling Spirit is directly related to the indwelling of the Father and Son comes from 1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">John: ‘And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given us’ (1 Jn 3:24); ‘By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit’ (1 Jn 4:13). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What John 14 yields is a remarkable picture of the mutual indwelling of the Father, Son, and Spirit with the disciples of Christ. In answer to the question, ‘show us the Father’, Jesus unveils a revelation, not just of ‘seeing’ the Father, but of a vital and mutual indwelling relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. All this comes in a context concerned with loving the Son, with keeping the commandments, and with doing the works of the Father. It is not just sheer relationship that is announced here, but a new way of living human life (commandments and works) marked by the three persons dwelling in the disciples (and the disciples in them). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What does John 15 add to this picture? First, that abiding in Christ (the branches in the vine) is intended for a fruitfulness pleasing to the Father (Jn 15:2–8). The image of Christ as the vine is rich with Old Testament echoes. In short, John is showing Jesus here to be the true vine, the true Israel, in whom all the promises to Abraham are fulfilled (see Isaiah 5). The abiding of the disciples in Jesus is not just for their personal delight alone—it is intended by the Father to yield a harvest for the kingdom of God manifest in the works of love (and once again 1 John confirms that the works of fraternal love are to mark the Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p473"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> one who truly abides in God). Second, Jesus calls the disciples his ‘friends’, for he now will include them in his counsels and his work (Jn 15:15). Divine friendship marked by participation in the work and counsel of the Son himself is one important consequence of the ‘abiding’ that John speaks of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In John 17 the statement of mutual indwelling reaches a kind of crescendo. The specific qualities of unity and love are now added to the earlier testimony to mutual indwelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus prays:</p>
<p class="calibre1">That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me … I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me  <b class="calibre3">(p. 450) </b>and loved them even as you loved me … I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them. (Jn 17:21, 23, 26) The mutual indwelling and unity are ordered to witness, ‘so that the world may believe’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the unity of the disciples with the Son and with each other, the love of the Father for the Son and the disciples is made manifest—and this love is the primary witness to those outside this fellowship of mutual love, inviting them to enter it and find life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opening verses of 1 John reformulate the mutual indwelling by speaking of the fellowship (or communion) of the Father and Son that the disciples are called to enter: ‘That which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ’ (1 Jn 1:3). Just what this fellowship (κοινωνία) implies bears further investigation, but at the very least for 1 John it includes adherence to the truth of what has been revealed about the Son and a life of mutual love in the Christian community: And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. (1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jn 4:14–16)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The link between salvation and mutual indwelling (or abiding) is particularly evident here. The end result of Jesus’ work as the ‘saviour of the world’ is that ‘God abides’ in us, and we ‘in God’. Because God is love, the end or goal of salvation is that by loving we </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘abide in God’ and God ‘abides in us’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3. </b> <b class="calibre3">Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> What does this brief survey of some of the main biblical texts enable and allow us to say about ‘Christian life as an existence in the Trinity’? The most basic conclusion is that Christian salvation entails a mutual indwelling of the believer (and the believing community) and the Triune God. Christian existence begins with baptism in the name of the Fa</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p474"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> ther, Son, and Spirit—and this includes a participation in the death and resurrection of Christ and the gift of the indwelling Spirit. In Paul and John we find striking statements of how we are ‘in God’, ‘in Christ’, and ‘in the Spirit’, and even more remarkable, how the Father, Son, and Spirit live in us, dwell in us, and make their home in us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These assertions of mutual indwelling, however, are not mostly concerned with states of prayer and contemplation (though these are obviously not to be excluded), but are found in contexts where the concern is rather with unity in the body, the love of the brothers and sisters, and the witness of the truth of the Gospel to the world. In other  <b class="calibre3">(p. 451)</b> words, it is ‘normal’ Christian life and practice—ethics, corporate worship, and mission—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is governed and informed by the mutual indwelling of the Trinitarian persons and the disciples. This is a crucial insight for correcting the view that the biblical texts we have examined on indwelling really concern only higher states of prayer and mysticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather,  <i class="calibre4">everything</i> in the Christian life, if it is truly Christian, is characterized by the dwelling of God in us and our abiding in God. The whole of the Christian life is premised on the Father and Son making their home in us through the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To specify further, the Christian disciple is made capable of, and called to pursue, transformation into the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29).  <i class="calibre4">Because</i> God has come to dwell in us effectively, we can and must become like Christ, living and acting in imitation of him. In this case the Trinity serves less as an abstract model or principle, and much more as an interpersonal life that we actually participate in, so that we may be changed and may act in a way befitting to God himself. Jesus’ demand that ‘you must be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect’ (Matt. 5:48) is a counsel of despair unless there is a ‘power at work within us’ (Eph. 3:20) enabling us to live in imitation of the Father. Marked by a transformed mind (Rom. 12:1) and a love that is willing to go to death (Jn 15:13), Christian life in the Trinity also entails a share in advancing the kingdom of God through the Gospel, in all the various ways that this can occur. Living in the Trinity is not a holiday from the tasks of the kingdom, but is a commission to be co-workers in the reconciling work of the Father through the Son and in the Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is debate over what mutual indwelling implies and entails. Just what does John mean when he says that ‘our κοινωνία is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ’ (1 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jn 1:3), or what does Paul understand when he prays for the ‘joimymýa of the Holy Spirit’ (2 Cor. 13:13)? John Webster eschews the term ‘communion’ for joimymýa because ‘the communication [of God's absolute life] does not mean that creatures participate in the life proper to the Holy Trinity, for then God would be not only the giver of life  <i class="calibre4">to</i> creatures but also the receiver of life  <i class="calibre4">from</i> creatures; and so his life would no longer be absolute’. Instead he prefers the term ‘fellowship’ to describe this reality because it communicates intimacy while still upholding the unbridgeable gap between God and creatures: ‘Fellowship indicates the mutuality of grace, not of shared being’ (Webster 2006: 150). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert Letham, to the contrary, believes that ‘fellowship’ is too weak a term to describe the divine indwelling witnessed to in the biblical texts: Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p475"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> We are called to partake of what God is. This is more than mere fellowship. Fellowship entails intimate interaction, but no participation in the nature of the one with whom such interaction takes place. Peter's language [2 Pet. 1:4] means that this goes far beyond external relations. There is an actual participation in the divine nature. (Letham 2004: 469) In a similar vein, Avery Dulles maintains that ‘fellowship in the Trinity, then, makes the Church much more than a society of friends, in the ordinary sense of the word. It is also a participation in the communion of the divine persons’ (Dulles 2006: 74). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Webster is certainly justified in his desire to rule out any sense of ‘shared being’ between God and the creature, such that God becomes dependent on creatures for his  <b class="calibre3">(p. 452) </b>being and happiness—or that we somehow ‘become God’ by nature in a pantheistic sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But do the terms ‘communion’ and ‘participation’ necessarily entail the kind of breach of the creator–creature divide that Webster is rightly wary of? It is noteworthy that the common terms for ‘participation’ and ‘sharing’ are variously employed in the New Testament itself to depict the creature's relationship to the Triune God (Keating 2004: 148–50). And the testimony of Paul and John—as we have seen—speaks in the strongest language about the real indwelling of God (Father, Son, and Spirit) in the believer (and the believer in God). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Fathers of the Church laboured in the effort to join together these two paradoxical truths: that the persons of the Triune God genuinely come to dwell effectively in us, such that we can speak of communion, participation, and even deification, but that at the same time the creator-creature divide must be sharply maintained, and that none of this produces any change in God himself. Rather, human participation and deification through the effective indwelling of the divine persons is a fruit of the love of God who has fitted us (in creation and by means of redemption) for this very share in his own life. The classic formulation, found throughout the Christian tradition, is that we come to share in the divine life (and so are deified), not by nature, but by grace. Athanasius speaks in these terms: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wherefore [the Word] is very God, existing one in essence with the very Father; while other beings, to whom he said, “I said you are gods” (Ps. 82:6), had this grace from the Father, only by participation of the Word, through the Spirit’ (Athanasius,  <i class="calibre4">Contra Arianos</i> I.9; Athanasius 1994: 311). Augustine draws this conclusion with even greater contrast: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It is evident, then, as he has called men gods, that they are deified by his grace, not born of his substance…. If we have been made sons of God, we have also been made gods: but this is the effect of grace adopting, not of nature generating’ (Augustine,  <i class="calibre4">Enarrationes in</i> <i class="calibre4">Psalmos</i> 49.2; Russell 2004: 331). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian life as an existence in the Trinity does not remove us from the sphere of being and remaining creatures. Our glorification (Rom. 8:29) is not a metaphysical promotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ours is a ‘participation’ in the divine nature, but this participation is dependent on the utter difference between Creator and creature remaining intact. We remain the human beings we are, sharing in the divine life of the Father, Son, and Spirit as creaturely sons and daughters. This leads, finally, to the conclusion that it is  <i class="calibre4">human</i> life in this material, tem</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p476"></a><b class="calibre3">Trinity and Salvation: Christian Life as an Existence in the Trinity</b> poral world that is governed and empowered by the indwelling with the Father, Son, and Spirit. It is not a life apart from our human existence, or leading us to a plane of existence beyond that of our creaturely calling. It is precisely our human life, now redeemed in Christ, with all its created limitations that is to be infused with and ‘lived in’ by the Father and the Son through the Spirit making their home in us. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article considers the doctrine of the Trinity in relation to liturgy and preaching. It discusses Basil the Great's Trinitarian doxology and shows how doxologies, preaching, and hymnody developed to foster Christians' worship in accordance with the Trinitarian and mediatorial patterns found in the New Testament. It explains that Basil's work helped to solidify the full Trinitarianism that would receive conciliar statement in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 and suggests that the most significant liturgical legacy of Basil's treatise was the continuance throughout corporate Christian worship of both types of address to God: the coordinate address to all three persons of the Trinity in high doxological moments and the mediatorial formulation of particular praise and prayer. </p>

<p class="calibre1">DETAILED theological reflection on worship or liturgy, on the one hand, and the doctrine and reality of the Trinity, on the other, reaches back at least as far as the treatise of St Basil of Caesarea,  <i class="calibre4">On the Holy Spirit</i>, which was composed  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.373 during perhaps the third generation of the Arian controversies. Bishop Basil was accused by Arianizers of innovation when he concluded his church's prayers with a ‘co-ordinated’ doxology in terms of an address to the Father ‘with’ ( <i class="calibre4">meta</i>) the Son ‘together with’ ( <i class="calibre4">sun</i>) the Holy Spirit. Part of his reply consisted in citing examples from his predecessors of similar usage but also, and more importantly for our purposes, in demonstrating the propriety of addressing worship to the second and third persons on account of their divine status as proven by delicate exegesis from Scripture. Basil also needed to show that the more usual practice of concluding praise and prayer to the Father ‘through’ ( <i class="calibre4">dia</i>) Christ ‘in’ ( <i class="calibre4">en</i>) the Spirit did not entail any subordination of the latter two. Basil's work, together with that of the two Cappadocian Gregories, helped to solidify the full Trinitarianism that would receive conciliar statement in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381. The most significant ‘liturgical’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">legacy of Basil's treatise was the continuance throughout corporate Christian worship of <i class="calibre4">both</i> types of address to God: the co-ordinate address to all three persons of the Trinity in Page 1 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p479"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> high doxological moments, and the ‘mediatorial’ formulation of particular praise and prayer. Basil's underlying ‘systematic’ achievement was to justify the two types by making the one appropriate to God ‘contemplated in himself’, where the three persons are </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘co-inherent’, and the other appropriate to that same God when considered in his ‘economy’ where the three persons ‘co-operate’ for the sake of the creatures: all good gifts originate with the Father and reach us through the Son in the Spirit; correspondingly, thanks and petition arise in the Spirit and are transported by the Son to the Father as the ultimate source and goal of salvation.1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 458) The Lesser and the Greater Doxologies</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We already find in Basil testimony to a strictly conjunctive form of doxology. Anecdotally, he recounts having heard from ‘a certain Mesopotamian, a man experienced both in language and accurate knowledge’, that in the formulation of doxology ‘the grammatical rules of their language force them to use their equivalent of the conjunction “and” ’—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is matched by other Syrian evidence. Basil continues: ‘What about the entire West, almost from Illyrium to the boundaries of the empire? Does it not prefer this word?’ ( <i class="calibre4">On</i> <i class="calibre4">the Holy Spirit</i>, 74). It may indeed be from Syria that the Greek and Latin churches acquired what became known as ‘the lesser gloria’ (‘lesser’ only on account of its brevity), familiar in English as ‘Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.’2</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lesser gloria (‘ <i class="calibre4">Doxa to patri …</i> ’; ‘ <i class="calibre4">Gloria patri …</i> ’) is characteristically used in worship to conclude the recitation of the Psalms. The practice is found not only in the offices of the ‘liturgical’ churches but also in churches of the Reformed tradition. To match the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘metrical psalms’, typically Trinitarian doxologies were composed according to the rhythms of the vernacular poetic versions of the biblical texts. Perhaps the most enduring metrical doxology in English is Thomas Ken's:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Praise him, all creatures here below; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Praise him above, ye heavenly host; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The theological import of this usage is that the whole history of salvation and the entire life and destiny of the worshippers is enfolded in the reality of the Triune God. A similar effect is often achieved by the ‘psalm prayers’ or ‘psalter collects’ appended to the liturgical recitation. A fine and quite intricate example is that formulated by Dionysius the Netherlandish Carthusian in the fifteenth century for Psalm 33, reflecting as it does a traditional Trinitarian interpretation of verse 6: O Christ, Word of the Eternal Father, by whom the heavens were made: enlighten us with the gift of thy Spirit and stablish us in good works, that we may be justified through faith in the Trinity and through working that which is pleasing to thee, and may, together with the people thou hast chosen for thine inheritance, be Page 2 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p480"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> glorified for ever; who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. Amen.3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 459) </b>Another example of a short Trinitarian doxology appended to a liturgical feature is the Orthodox expansion of the Lord's Prayer itself: ‘For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, the Father's, the Son's, and the Holy Spirit's.’4 A concise Trinitarian invocation is used to begin the eucharistic service in the Orthodox churches (imitated by some others in recent liturgical revisions): ‘Blessed be the kingdom of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit now and for ever and unto the ages of ages.’ In many churches, the solemn blessing of departing worshippers at the conclusion of the liturgy is pronounced as from the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">East and West share the so-called ‘greater gloria’ or  <i class="calibre4">Gloria in excelsis</i>, which serves as the climax of Byzantine matins and finds a place in the eucharistic rites of the West.5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dating from the fourth century and bearing perhaps marks of Trinitarian controversies, the hymn is developed from the angelic chorus at the birth of Christ (Lk. 2:13–14). Directed principally towards the Father, the address shifts to ‘the only-begotten Son’, with the Holy Spirit finally being mentioned in fully Trinitarian form: Glory to God in the highest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and peace to his people on earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord God, heavenly King, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almighty God and Father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we worship you, we give you thanks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we praise you for your glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of the Father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord God, Lamb of God, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you take away the sin of the world:</p>
<p class="calibre1">have mercy on us; </p>
<p class="calibre1">you are seated at the right hand of the Father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">receive our prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For you alone are the Holy One, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you alone are the Lord, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you alone are the Most High, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus Christ, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with the Holy Spirit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the glory of God the Father. Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar manoeuvres occur in the canticle  <i class="calibre4">Te Deum laudamus</i>, which is traditionally attributed to St Ambrose of Milan (here cited in the English form familiar from the  <i class="calibre4">Book of</i> <i class="calibre4">Common Prayer</i>):</p>
<p class="calibre1">We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Baptism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Admission into the worshipping company takes place by way of baptism. According to Matt. 28:16–20, the baptism of disciples from among the nations is to be administered ‘in the name of Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’. Against the Arianizers, Athanasius and the Cappadocians advanced the threefold profession of faith at baptism, arguing that salvation was at stake, since none but the Triune God could save.6 The minister's pronouncement of the threefold name constituted, in later terminology, the ‘form’ of the sacrament: ‘N., I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’ (in the Latin West); ‘The servant of God, N., is baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’ (in the Greek East). Together with the ‘performative act’ of applying the water, it functions—in the terminology of twentieth-century linguistic philosophy—as a ‘performative word’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The performative Trinitarian word occurs again in the administration of penance, which may be seen as a renewal of baptism. At baptism, the questions put to the candidate and/</p>
<p class="calibre1">or the recitation of the creed had set the scene in the history of salvation: Do you believe in God the Father? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and born of the Virgin Mary. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He ascended into heaven, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p482"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> the holy catholic Church, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the communion of saints, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the forgiveness of sins, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the resurrection of the body, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the life everlasting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So also in the sacrament of penance, the prologue to the absolution in the Catholic rite recalls the purpose and operation of the Triune God:</p>
<p class="calibre1">God the Father of mercies through the death and resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins. Through the ministry of the Church may God give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Provided the ‘conjunctive’ banner is held firmly aloft, there is no threat to the Trinity in the ‘mediatorial’ pattern of worship, or indeed in the highlighting of one divine person at particular points of the liturgy, so that now a patrological, now a Christological, now a pneumatological accent may be encountered.7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Mediatorial Pattern of Worship as Grounded in the New Testament</b> The mediatorial pattern, in fact, predominates in the New Testament. It is epitomized in Eph. 2:18: ‘through him [Christ] we both [Jewish and Gentile Christians] have access in one Spirit to the Father’. The passage develops into a picture of the Church as itself what might be considered a trinitarianly structured temple (Eph. 2:19–22). In the following chapter, the writer voices both a prayer of petition and an ascription of glory such as can be construed along Trinitarian lines (Eph. 3:14–21). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most characteristically, the Letter to the Hebrews presents Christ as the great high priest: his earthly mission has been accomplished, and now he is seated at the right hand <b class="calibre3">(p. 462) </b>of the Father, from whom as Son and Word he had his origin (Heb. 1:1–14; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2). There Christ ‘makes intercession’ for his followers, and it is ‘through’ Christ that we are able to ‘draw near’ to God (Heb. 7:25; 10:19–22; 13:15;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Rom. 8:34). The New Testament epistles show our worship as thus offered to God not only on account of what Christ has already done but also by his present mediation, linguistically signified by the preposition ‘through’ with the genitive case: ‘ <i class="calibre4">dia tou Christou</i>’ (Rom. 1:8; 16:27; 2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cor. 1:20; 1 Pet. 2:5). Behind that pattern may stand a word of Jesus during his ministry: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them’ (Matt. 18:19–20). </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are, however, places in the New Testament where Christ is mentioned as the recipient of worship, in close proximity to the Father. Particularly significant is what is proba</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p483"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> bly a pre-Pauline hymn cited in Phil. 2:5–11, at whose conclusion the application to Christ of the name or title ‘Lord’ is strikingly brought into connection with Isa. 45:18–25: Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Phil. 2:9–11)8</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the book of Revelation, Christ figures as ‘the Lamb’ on the throne of heaven with God, to whom songs of praise are addressed (6:6–14; 7:9–12; 21:22; 22:1–5). In the fourth century, the worship of Christ is advanced by Athanasius and the Cappadocians as witness to his divinity, for otherwise Christians would (unthinkably!) be guilty of idolatry.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit figures most clearly as teaching, inspiring, helping or enabling prayer, as for instance in Romans 8:</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we cry ‘Abba! Father!’ it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God…. (vv. 15–16)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. (vv. 26–7) Or take again 1 Cor. 2:9–13, which has implications also for apostolic preaching and teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only in two possible cases in the New Testament is worship addressed to the Holy Spirit more or less by name. At Phil. 3:3, it is possible to take  <i class="calibre4">hoi Pneumati Theou latreuontes</i> as </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘who worship the Spirit of God’, since in Greek the object of the verb  <i class="calibre4">latreuein</i> is expressed in the dative case, and that is how St Augustine interpreted the text in  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> I.13; but the context, where the Apostle is making a contrast with ‘the flesh’, favours construing a dative of instrument: ‘those who worship by the Spirit of God’. The other passage is 1 Cor. 6:19–20: <b class="calibre3">(p. 463)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You are not your own; you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">St Augustine's Latin text reads ‘ <i class="calibre4">glorificate ergo Deum in corpore vestro</i>’, where the Latin allows ‘in your body’ to be taken as adjectival to God: glorify ‘(the) God (which is) in your body’; but the Greek— <i class="calibre4">doxasate de ton Theon en tôi sômati humôn</i>—will in fact support only an adverbial sense of instrument or location: glorify God ‘with your body’ or ‘in your body’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most complex case of a possibly Trinitarian doxology in the New Testament occurs at the end of the eleventh chapter of the Letter to the Romans, particularly as interpreted Page 6 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p484"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> along the line of the western tradition from Augustine onwards. Having earlier in the epistle established the universal solidarity of Gentiles with Jews in sin and guilt and the inclusion of both in salvation through Christ, the Apostle in chapters 9–11 again surveys their relationship in the eyes of God and in history, finally inferring that ‘God has concluded all men in unbelief, in order that he might have mercy upon all’. This resolution prompts the Apostle to an outburst of praise, which St Thomas Aquinas, for instance, interprets in Trinitarian fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgements and how unsearchable his ways! ‘For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?’ [Isa. 40:13]. ‘Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?’ [Job 41:11]. For from him and through him and in him are all things. To him be glory unto the ages of ages. Amen. (Rom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">11:33–6)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Apostle, says Thomas, ‘exclaims his admiration of the divine excellence’ in all the mentioned respects. Particularly interesting for our subject is the commentator's exposition of the three Pauline prepositions—‘ <i class="calibre4">ex</i>’, ‘ <i class="calibre4">per</i>’, and ‘ <i class="calibre4">in</i>’—that relate ‘all things’ (except sin) to God:</p>
<p class="calibre1">All things are  <i class="calibre4">from</i> him, i.e., God as from the first operating power. All things are <i class="calibre4">through</i> him, inasmuch as he makes all things through his wisdom. All things are <i class="calibre4">in</i> him as kept in his goodness which preserves them ( <i class="calibre4">in bonitate conservante</i>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now these three things, namely, power, wisdom and goodness, are common to the three persons [of the Godhead]. Hence, the statement that ‘from him and through him and in him are all things’ can be applied to each of the three persons. Nevertheless, the power, which involves the notion of principle, is appropriated to the Father, who is the principle of the entire Godhead; wisdom to the Son, who proceeds as Word, which is nothing else than wisdom begotten; goodness is appropriated to the Holy Spirit, who proceeds as love, whose object is goodness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, by appropriation we can say:  <i class="calibre4">from him</i>, namely from the Father, <i class="calibre4">through him</i>, namely through the Son,  <i class="calibre4">in him</i>, namely in the Holy Spirit, are all things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus when Thomas moves with Paul to the ascription of worship (both ‘honour’ and ‘glory’), he envisages the sovereign and all-sufficient Triune God: When he [the Apostle] says,  <i class="calibre4">To him be honour and glory forever</i>, he allows God's dignity, which consists in the two things previously mentioned. For from the fact that all  <b class="calibre3">(p. 464) </b>things are from Him and through Him and in Him, honour and reverence and subjection are owed Him by every creature: ‘If I am a father, where is my honour?’ (Mal. 1:6). But from the fact that He has not received either counsel or gifts from anyone, glory is owed Him; just as on the contrary it is said of man: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘If then you received it, why do you boast as though it were not a gift?’ (1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p485"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> 4:7). And because this is proper to God, it says in Isaiah (42:8): ‘I am the Lord; my glory I give to no other.’10</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Unto the ages of ages’ is interpreted by Thomas as referring either to the unpassing nature of God's glory or to God's eternity as—‘though one and simple in itself’—‘containing’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">all ages. And ‘Amen’ means ‘May it be so’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Glory to God in Himself</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside the greater and the lesser glorias, the boldest textual moves made by the Christian liturgy in pushing through the mediatorial pattern to ‘contemplate God as he is in himself’ occur on Trinity Sunday, which in the West came into its own as a distinct feast between the tenth and the fourteenth centuries. After following the sequence of Christ's birth, baptism, earthly ministry, passion, death, resurrection, and ascension, and the pentecostal gift of the Holy Spirit, the traditional yearly calendar thus culminated theologically in the feast of the Holy Trinity. The story of salvation is there gathered up in the worshippers’ closest access to the very mystery of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the Missal of Paul VI provides two opening prayers for choice on the Sunday after Pentecost:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us pray [to the one God, Father, Son and Spirit, that our lives may bear witness to our faith]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father, you sent your Word to bring us truth, and your Spirit to make us holy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through them we come to know the mystery of your life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Help us to worship you, one God in three Persons, by proclaiming and living our faith in you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alternatively:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us pray [to our God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God, we praise you:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Father all-powerful; Christ Lord and Saviour; Spirit of love. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 465) </b>You reveal yourself in the depths of our being, drawing us to share in your life and your love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One God, three Persons, </p>
<p class="calibre1">be near to the people formed in your image, </p>
<p class="calibre1">close to the world your love brings to life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We ask you this, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one God, true and living, for ever and ever. Amen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p486"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> And the preface of the eucharistic prayer for the feast of the Holy Trinity accents the divine glory: Father, all powerful and ever-living God, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we do well always and everywhere to give you thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We joyfully proclaim our faith</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the mystery of your Godhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You have revealed your glory</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the glory also of your Son</p>
<p class="calibre1">and of the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p class="calibre1">three Persons equal in majesty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">undivided in splendour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet one Lord, one God, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ever to be adored in your everlasting glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, with all the choirs of angels in heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">we proclaim your glory</p>
<p class="calibre1">and join in their unending hymn of praise:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holy, holy, holy …</p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditionally, Trinity Sunday was a standard occasion for reciting in the office the so-called Athanasian Creed, the  <i class="calibre4">Quicunque vult</i> of the Book of Common Prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Eastern Orthodox traditions, the ‘contemplation’ of God comes to visual exercise in the icons of the Trinity, where the three heavenly visitors to Abraham and Sarah are ‘reworked’ into a ‘representation’ of the Trinity. The most celebrated example of such an ‘insight into God’ is the icon by Andrei Rublev, where ‘inverse perspective’ draws the contemplative viewer into a scene that lacks for nothing in significant postures, gestures, colours, and compositional ‘rhythm’ as a ‘window’ into the interrelated Trinity.11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Prosopological Accentuation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As already hinted: within the general Trinitarian pattern, the accent may fall now on one person of the Trinity, now on another, now on a third, as the moments of the liturgy unfold. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 466) </b>Corresponding to ‘the Word made flesh’, it is appropriate that a Christological emphasis mark both the reading of the Scriptures and holy communion. It is in the reading from the Gospels that the churches have most acutely sensed the presence of Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Byzantine commentators take the ‘Little Entry’ of the priest with the gospel-book to represent the entrance of Christ upon the world at his incarnation. Lights, incense, and kisses are the Gospel's ceremonial accompaniment. The reading of the Gospel is traditionally preceded in many rites by the singing of Alleluia. At the announcement of the Gospel, the characteristically terse acclamation of the Roman people is ‘Gloria tibi, Domine’; and at its conclusion, ‘Laus tibi, Christe’. The West Syrian greeting is the same as recurs in the eucharistic anaphora: ‘Blessed is he who came and is to come’, with the addition ‘Praise be to him who sent him for our salvation’.12 Coming to the moment of communion, the Page 9 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p487"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> Byzantine rite hails the sacramental Christ in the ‘ <i class="calibre4">Ta hagia tois hagiois</i>’: ‘One is Holy. One is the Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father.’ In the Roman rite, Christ is addressed as the ‘Agnus Dei’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If, given the unique location of Jesus in salvation history, the Christological accent may be considered, in liturgical terms, as ‘anamnetic’, the pneumatological accent is appropriately ‘epicletic’: the Holy Spirit is ‘called upon’ to enable faith and prayer. Coming after the proclamation of the Gospel, the creedal confession—itself Trinitarian in structure—is a rehearsal of the faith that was first professed at baptism; and ‘the prayers of the faithful’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">seek for progress in the Christian life by those who already believe, and the extension of God's saving purpose among all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great eucharistic prayer or ‘anaphora’ is offered up principally to the Father, as the classical ‘prefaces’ make clear. The patrological accent corresponds to the sacrifice whereby Christ ‘through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God’ (Heb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">9:14). As the prayer continues, commemoration is made of all Christ's work, and the Holy Spirit is invoked to bring the fruits of that work to bear. In one way or another, the closing doxology brings co-ordinate praise to the Trinity, such as was presaged already in the Sanctus, where the thrice-holy of Isa. 6:3 and Rev. 4:8 resounds with Trinitarian intent. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Trinitarian Preaching</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The second Vatican Council, in its Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, restated what had always been in principle true: the homily is ‘part of the liturgy itself’ ( <i class="calibre4">pars ipsius</i> <i class="calibre4">liturgiae</i>).13 Historically, Protestant churches have sometimes confronted the opposite </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘prob <b class="calibre3">(p. 467) </b>lem’ to what was there being corrected among Catholics: how to find a liturgy into which the all-important sermon could be fitted.14</p>
<p class="calibre1">In his modern classic,  <i class="calibre4">The Apostolic Preaching and its Developments</i>, C. H. Dodd reconstructed from the summary speeches in Acts and from stereotyped passages in the New Testament epistles a ‘kerygma’ that was clearly proto-Trinitarian in content and shape: God's prophecies of old are fulfilled, and the new age is inaugurated by the coming of Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was born of the seed of David. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He died according to the Scriptures, to deliver us out of the present evil age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was buried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He rose on the third day according to the Scriptures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is exalted at the right hand of God, as Son of God and Lord of quick and dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He will come again as Judge and Saviour of men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, ‘the  <i class="calibre4">kerygma</i> always closes with an appeal for repentance, the offer of forgiveness and of the Holy Spirit, and the promise of “salvation,” that is, of “the life of the age to come,” to those who [by baptism] enter the elect community’ (Acts 2:38–9; 3:19, 25–</p>
<p class="calibre1">6).15</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p488"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> The ‘developments’ can be found, as the second century progressed, in the ‘rule of faith’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">or ‘canon of truth’ to which Irenaeus and Tertullian bore witness.16</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matching the Trinitarian content of the Christian message, the act, event, and result of preaching may appropriately be considered in Trinitarian terms, and the liturgical dimension is not far to seek.17</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the perennial need for the proclamation of the Gospel both within and beyond the Christian community, we may take our hints from St Paul's Letter to the Romans. Immediately after the opening salutation, the Apostle speaks of such preaching in liturgical terms:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thank ( <i class="calibre4">eucharistô</i>) my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son ( <i class="calibre4">hô latreuô en tôi pneumati mou en tôi euangeliô tou huiou</i> <i class="calibre4">autou</i>), that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers ( <i class="calibre4">pantote epi tôn</i> <i class="calibre4">proseuchôn mou</i>)…. I am eager to preach the gospel ( <i class="calibre4">euangelisasthai</i>) to you also who are in Rome. (Rom. 1:8–15)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 468) </b>And then in chapter 15, he speaks of ‘the grace given me by God to be a minister ( <i class="calibre4">leitourgos</i>) of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God ( <i class="calibre4">hierourgountos to euangelion tou theou</i>), so that the offering ( <i class="calibre4">prosphora</i>) of the Gentiles may be acceptable ( <i class="calibre4">euprosdektos</i>), sanctified ( <i class="calibre4">hêgiasmenê</i>) by the Holy Spirit’: ‘I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit … I know that when I come to you I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ’ (vv. 15–29).18 There we find preaching paradigmatically displayed as the ‘anamnesis’ of Christ, under the ‘epiclesis’ of the Holy Spirit, an </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘anaphora’ to the Father in its own expression and in the fruit that it bears among those who respond in faith; and so it has properly remained in the practice of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that the already evangelized needed exhortation to live by the Gospel comes to light in the intervening chapters, and the goal is again set in Trinitarian and liturgical terms. In Rom. 15:5–6, the Apostle prays thus for the Roman congregation: May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to be of one mind among yourselves, according to the will of Christ Jesus, that you may with one heart and one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, steadfastness ( <i class="calibre4">hupomonê</i>) is often mentioned in a pneumatic context, almost as though it were a gift of the Spirit (Rom. 5:1–5; 8:23–7; 2 Cor. 6:1–10; 12:12; 1 Thess. 1:2–</p>
<p class="calibre1">7); and encouragement ( <i class="calibre4">paraklêsis</i>;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 1 Cor. 14:3, 31; Phil. 2:1) suggests the Paraclete (Jn 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7); so that the Holy Spirit may appropriately be considered the divine source to which Paul looks in asking on behalf of the Romans that, as obedient followers of Christ, they be of one mind ( <i class="calibre4">to auto phronein</i>), one heart or will ( <i class="calibre4">homothu</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p489"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Liturgy and Preaching</b> <i class="calibre4">madon</i>), and one mouth or voice ( <i class="calibre4">en heni stomati</i>), in their glorification of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hymnody</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It has recently been argued that the generally weak Trinitarianism of much modern English Protestant theology was due to a shift in the use of the ‘rule of faith’ from ‘invocation’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">to ‘assent’.19 Rather than being the ‘name’ of the divine reality encountered in the economy of salvation, ‘Father, Son, and Holy Spirit’ became a ‘doctrine’ needing  <b class="calibre3">(p. 469) </b>speculative proof in regard to the inner constitution of the Godhead and thereby forfeited practical interest, betokened in the legacy of John Locke's  <i class="calibre4">The Reasonableness of Christianity</i> (1695). The contrasts should not be overplayed that Jason Vickers draws between early Christian and post-Reformational usage, or between liturgical invocation and intellectual assent, or indeed between the ‘economic’ and the ‘immanent’ Trinity. On the positive side, Vickers pays appropriate tribute to the hymnody of Charles Wesley as a vehicle of preserving the Trinitarian experience in the believing and worshipping community. That Wesley was well aware of the dogmatic issues at stake is clear from the fact that he structured his 1767 collection  <i class="calibre4">Hymns on the Trinity</i> according to the treatise of William Jones of Nayland,  <i class="calibre4">The Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity, proved by above an hundred short and</i> <i class="calibre4">clear arguments, expressed in terms of the Holy Scripture</i> (1756), which was written precisely to combat resurgent Arianism and emergent Unitarianism. The four main sections in the arrangement of 136 Wesleyan hymn-texts are headed ‘The Divinity of Christ’, ‘The Divinity of the Holy Ghost’, ‘The Plurality and Trinity of Persons’, ‘The Trinity in Unity’.20</p>
<p class="calibre1">A single example of a Trinitarian hymn by Charles Wesley must suffice: included in the definitive  <i class="calibre4">Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People called Methodists</i> of 1780, this hymn kept its place—admittedly abbreviated as here—in successive British Methodist hymnals throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: Father of everlasting grace, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy goodness and thy truth we praise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goodness and thy truth we prove; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thou hast, in honour of thy Son, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gift unspeakable sent down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit of life, and power, and love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Send us the Spirit of thy Son, </p>
<p class="calibre1">To make the depths of Godhead known, </p>
<p class="calibre1">To make us share the life divine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Send him the sprinkled blood to apply, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Send him our souls to sanctify, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And show and seal us ever thine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So shall we pray, and never cease, </p>
<p class="calibre1">So shall we thankfully confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy wisdom, truth, and power, and love; </p>

<p class="calibre1">And bless and praise thee evermore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And serve thee as thy hosts above:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 470) </b>Till, added to that heavenly choir, </p>
<p class="calibre1">We raise our songs of triumph higher, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And praise thee in a bolder strain, </p>

<p class="calibre1">And sing, with all our friends in light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thy everlasting love to man.21</p>
<p class="calibre1">That Wesleyan hymn seems to match what the Benedictine theologian and liturgist Cipriano Vagaggini calls a ‘way of communion between God and humankind’ that can be described in the following circulatory fashion: Every good gift comes to us from the Father, through the medium of Jesus Christ his incarnate Son, in the presence of the Holy Spirit; and likewise, it is in the presence of the Holy Spirit, through the medium of Jesus Christ the incarnate Son, that everything must return to the Father and be reunited to its end, the most blessed Trinity. This is the Christological-Trinitarian activity of the sacred history of salvation, the plan of God in the world. The whole structure of the liturgy presupposes this activity, without which the liturgy would be incomprehensible.22</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE images of the Trinity in the Christian visual arts are begotten by the expressive dynamic of the life of faith, or, more precisely, by the free and creative encounter of the needs of the prayerful and meditative heart, on the one hand, and the exigencies of the mind which is faithful to Scripture, the liturgy, and doctrine, on the other. These images make up a rich and varied ensemble, where the best mingles with the not so good, both from a spiritual and an aesthetic perspective, but where often abound an instructive and moving confidence and hope in God. These images can draw their compositional schemes or motifs from Babylonian, Egyptian, Hellenistic, Jewish, or Celtic art, but their subject and essential inspiration come from the Old Testament passages which the Church Fathers interpreted as prefigurations of the mystery of the Triunity of God and from the New Testament theophanies, from the normative formulations of the ecumenical councils and the treatises of the Fathers and later theologians, and from the liturgy, the Creed, prayer, devotion, and mysticism. Their creation and diffusion in the West, beginning with the ninth century and even more the twelfth century (Bœspflug and Zaluska 1994), was encouraged by the appearance of the votive Mass and later the Feast of the Trinity (Cabrol 1931; Klaus, dissertation, 1938; Browe 1950; Close 2000 and 2002), with the steady increase in chapels, churches, and monasteries dedicated to the Trinity (of which there were 287 in England: Bound 1914) and also with the explosive phenomenon of vi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p496"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> sions of the Trinity in the West beginning around 1100 (Bœspflug 1993; 1997b; 1998a and 1998b; 2002a and 2002b; Close 2009). But in order properly to understand this iconographic usage, we have to bear in mind what Trinitarian faith means, in relation to the image, to its context, and to its own inner logic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 473) Faith in the Trinity and its Iconic Consequences</b> Christians believe in the eternal existence of a single God. Jews and Muslims do the same, and hold, like Christians, that God is a perfect, absolutely spiritual, and radically transcendent being. They affirm together that God's transcendence makes it impossible for him to have any resembling representation: the Eternal, as such, has neither appearance nor outline, and offers no foothold for any kind of imitation or  <i class="calibre4">mimesis</i>. The most one can make of him are symbols and indirect signs (like a hand coming from the sky), which have no mimetic pretensions, but which conventionally designate his word, action, and presence. Such is the doctrine of God common to the three Abrahamic monotheisms, with its consequences for the visual arts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But faith in the Incarnation of the Word of God in Jesus, affirmed to be ‘true God and true man’ at the Council of Nicaea (325) and Chalcedon (451), led Christianity to define itself as a Trinitarian monotheism and to affirm that God is One in Three. The Trinity is the mystery of a single God in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, recognized as distinct within the unity of one nature, essence, or substance. This mystery cannot be encompassed by reason, for it is only known by revelation. In the Old Covenant God began by revealing himself as a centre of initiatives, a centre including a certain plurality (Griffiths 1996: ch. 11). The use of the plural (‘Let us make man in our own image’: Gen. 1:26) would be interpreted by Christians as a veiled revelation of the Triunity of God, whence the images of the Trinity creating humanity and creating the universe. Other episodes in the sacred history lent themselves to this interpretation, especially the hospitality of Abraham, when the patriarch saw three visitors approaching, and, when he received them, addressed them as a single interlocutor (Gen. 18). From this passage come, among others, the eastern icons of the Trinity, including the one by Rublev, and a very rich family of western narrative images. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This still veiled Triunity of God would be revealed in the New Covenant. When he was baptized in the Jordan, ‘immediately, coming up from the water, he [Jesus] saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” ’ (Mk 1:9–10). The story is told in a highly scenic way. Trinitarian doctrine therefore results from, among other sources, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘vision’ of which Jesus was the first recipient, a vision to which John the Baptist acceded ( <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Jn 1:32), then the apostles, other Christians (who participate by faith and the sacraments), and also potentially, much later, those who share in it by the mode of art, thanks to museums and books of art. Christian faith and with it the culture inspired by Christianity thus has a structural orientation toward the appropriation of a vision (Tavard 1981), Page 2 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p497"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> such as that of the theophany of baptism, or again that which is displayed in the prologue of John's Gospel: ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God’ (Jn 1:1), which was pictured many times without ever achieving a single </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘formulaic’ mode of composition (Bœspflug and Zaluska 1995 and 2004). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 474) </b>Trinitarian faith has its first attestation in the conclusion of Matthew's Gospel: </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Go, and make disciples of all nations, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit’ (Matt. 28:19). But the dogma of the Trinity was only articulated slowly, under the duress of controversies and through a tremendous work of reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tertullian's  <i class="calibre4">Against Praxeas</i> is the first treatise on the Trinity. It would be followed, in the East, by the writings of Basil of Caesarea, notably in his  <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i> (363–4), and of Gregory of Nazianzus (around 380) in his  <i class="calibre4">Theological Discourses</i>, and in the West by those of Novatian ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.250), Hilary of Poitiers (356–60), Faustinus (a priest of the Luciferian sect, around 380), and of Augustine of Hippo (399–419). </p>
<p class="calibre1">None of these treatises raises the question of whether the doctrine of the Trinity can be expressed in images. But Irenaeus of Lyons ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.180–5), in whom one already finds an exposition of Trinitarian faith, provided a turn of phrase which became for artists an illuminating motto: ‘The Father is the invisible of the Son, and the Son is the visible of the Father’ ( <i class="calibre4">Haer</i>. IV,6,6; Irenaeus 1965: 450). This phrase did not originally have images in mind, but intended simply to say that, on the one hand, as the Son rendered visible by the Incarnation, Jesus Christ reveals the Father (who is not incarnate and therefore remains invisible), and on the other hand that the visibility of Jesus Christ does not reveal all of himself, nor of the Father. A rule appears to have been set for the domain of art, which was never formulated nor officially promulgated but which would be observed over many centuries, namely that of the Christomorphism of the representation of God: God could be painted, but only God made man, that is, as the ‘Christ-God’ (an iconographic term, used to designate a figure of God in the form of Christ, just as the term is ‘Father-God’ when God is painted with the appearance of an old man). Not to respect this rule, and to imagine, for instance, the figure of God the Father as an old man, or the Trinity as three men, each of them with a distinct appearance (‘Non-Christomorphic triandric Trinities’, which vary the ages of the three persons), is to suppose that the revelation of God in Christ was imperfect and needed to be completed by other figures. Now, precisely: ‘the visible of the Father is the Son’. One could even add: ‘the Son is the visible of the Trinity’. Erwin Panofsky has explained at some length the significance for the history of Christian art of this element of theology, which implies that, in art, every image of Christ should be seen as an image of God and indeed as an image of the Trinity (Panofsky 1938). </p>
<p class="calibre1">One can nonetheless discern that the histories of the artistic representation of Christ (the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Christ-God’), of God the Father (the ‘Father-God’), of the Holy Spirit, and of the Trinity itself are at the same time distinct and related. Christian churches, beyond all denominational differences, affirm the legitimacy of images of God made man in Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Images of Christ as God, or if one prefers of the ‘Christ-God’, have been numerous. The divinity of Christ is not emphasized in the art of the catacombs, but begins to be so in Constantinian art, especially in the apse mosaics. This is the image of the Christ-Page 3 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p498"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> God,  <i class="calibre4">Pantocrator</i>, which will be at the centre of the iconoclastic controversy in Byzantium and which will be given a solemn legitimation at the second Council of Nicaea in 787. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth, apart from a few outbreaks of iconophobia (Claudius of Turin,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.820–5), it was hardly ever questioned until the Reformation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 475) </b>The third person of the Trinity has never had any iconic independence from the other two. The symbol under which the Spirit is manifested at Jesus’ baptism, the dove, rapidly became his accredited and almost exclusive symbol. The only exceptions to this generalization are the many triandric Trinities, representing the three persons as three men, and some images of the Holy Spirit by himself, pictured as a young man, which were condemned in an eighteenth-century papal document (Bœspflug 1984). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The images of God the Father as a figure deliberately distinct from that of Christ, after some sporadic appearances in paleo-Christian art, began their career only in the twelfth century, hesitantly at first until the Renaissance, when they became legion and triumphed (for example, with Michelangelo and Raphael), to the point of precipitating the end of the rule of Christomorphism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">History of the Trinity in Art</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding images of the Trinity, the historical outline is more complex because the subject is more contentious. One can distinguish five great periods in the history of the theme of the Christian God (thus of God and of the Trinity), or rather four plus one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> From the death of Jesus until the middle of the third century, Christianity propagated itself and spread its message without concerning itself with making images which could serve the liturgy or preaching. One can call this a phase of rigorous abstinence or of resolute aniconism. Belief in images of Christ which were miraculously painted in his lifetime, by the direct impression of his face on a cloth (the veil of Veronica, the Mandylion, the Holy Face of Edessa, the Holy Shroud), rests on ancient legends which historians cannot take up while remaining faithful to their own methods. The first Christian images are connected with funeral practices and are met especially in two kinds of art, the mural paintings of the catacombs and the reliefs of sarcophagi. Here the desire to paint Christ as God seems absent. Christ appears as a hardly individualized philosopher or wonder-worker, not as the Son of God of the Creed. The desire to produce images of the Trinity is non-existent. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> The iconic history of the Christian God only really begins with the Edict of Milan (313), the conversion of Constantine, and the end of persecution, when Christianity ceased to be an illegal religion and, with legality and the financial backing of the Emperor, could definitively come out from underground. The first images of Christ as God are no earlier than the fourth century of the Christian era. A good example is the mosaic of Santa Pudenziana in Rome, from around 400. The period of ‘the history of God in images’ which begins then is characterized by the  <i class="calibre4">indirect evocation</i> of the Trinitarian mystery. It extends from the fourth to the eighth century. There is a striking gap between the verbal and the plastic expression of the dogma. The Trinity is Page 4 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p499"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> the object of an immense labour of intellectual elucidation while at the same time, in art, it is seldom evoked and practically never represented. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 476) </b>This historical observation, which holds for the first eight centuries, requires a distinction of ‘images of the Trinity’ from ‘Trinitarian images’, a distinction which intersects with the one theologians establish between what Karl Rahner called the ‘economic Trinity’ and the ‘immanent Trinity’. ‘Images of the Trinity’ take the latter as their main subject or motif. These figurations are detached or detachable from biblical illustration, whereas ‘Trinitarian images’ are narrative images which take a page of sacred history as their main subject and set it in its Trinitarian dimension. ‘Trinitarian images’ illustrate those theophanies which the Fathers of the Church had taken in a Trinitarian sense. For the Old Testament, the hospitality of Abraham is the key story. Until the fourth century, most of the Fathers, both East and West, had interpreted this episode and the other Old Covenant theophanies Christologically, as a sign of the Incarnation and a manifestation of the Word, here escorted by two angels, to prepare the human race for his Incarnation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose and Augustine were among the first to take it as a prefiguration of the mystery of the Trinity which would be revealed in the New Testament. The mosaic of Saint Maria Major in Rome,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.432–40, still hesitates between the two interpretations: the higher register, privileging one of the visitors of Abraham, offers a Christological reading of the episode, while the lower register, which stresses the equality of the Three, makes a Trinitarian reading. By contrast, this hesitation is absent from the mosaic of San Vitale in Ravenna (an ‘orthodox’ church built after the reconquest of the town from the Arian Goths, between 532 and 547), which establishes no hierarchy among the Three. This Old Covenant subject remains rare until the ninth century, even after the Trinitarian interpretation had won through. It later spawned a very rich artistic posterity, up to our own times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Images taken from the New Testament were largely inspired by the baptism of Christ in the Jordan. Until the middle of the sixth century, representations of this episode were content to depict, in addition to Jesus and the Baptist, the Dove (without specifying that this was a metaphor); the voice of the Father was not rendered; it was only toward the end of the century, especially in the art of Byzantium and the Byzantine sphere of influence (a Palestinian reliquary,  <i class="calibre4">Sancta sanctorum</i>, in Rome, at the end of the sixth or turn of the seventh century; the  <i class="calibre4">Etchmiadzin Gospel</i>, seventh century), that images appeared in which the Trinitarian dimension of the baptismal theophany was rendered ‘in full’, by a Hand of God, a Dove, and Christ, in a vertical line: one can call this a Trinitarian image, but not an image of the Trinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Finally, some attempts were made to evoke the Trinity through non-figurative symbols and signs. Unique in its genre, the vault mosaic which dominates the Baptistery at Albenga (near Genoa, Italy),  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.500 (Fig. 1), is decorated with a triple chrism: the first two Greek letters of the name ‘Christ’ (X and P), ‘triplicated’ and superimposed, are each flanked with the letters Α and Ω and surrounded by three concentric mandorlas; the symbol thus constructed is clearly Trinitarian, but one could not precisely call it an image of the Trinity. The use of the triangle as a symbol was blocked by the disapproval of Augustine, who saw in it a Manichean symbol—the triangle disappears from art and only re-emerges at the beginning of the eleventh century (Uta Codex). It is only at the beginning of the sixteenth century, in particular in the art of engraving, that one  <b class="calibre3">(p. 477) </b> commonly finds the triangle of Trinitarian relations, where the sides and the spokes, moving from the three summits (named ‘Pater’, ‘Filius’, ‘Spiritus’) toward the centre (‘Deus’), are bearers of inscriptions ( <i class="calibre4">Pater est Deus, non est Filius</i>;  <i class="calibre4">Filius est Deus, non est Pater</i>, etc.). In Baroque art, finally, the triangle becomes the main symbol of the Trinity, and it remains a key image today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, during the five centuries of Christian art from the third to the eighth century, images of the Christ-God became ever more numerous, while the first attempts at representing the Trinity (some reliefs on sarcophagi depicting the creation of Adam and Eve and some miniatures) are rare and indirect. During the Patristic era, there is a striking contrast between putting the mystery of God into words and putting it into visual forms: the first received tremendous effort, whereas the second was scarcely attempted. This was not because of the difficulty of the subject, but out of deliberate abstention. The artists of the first centuries of the Christian era were not seeking to depict the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were dissuaded from doing so by theology. The second Council of Nicaea, which put an end to the iconoclastic controversy by defending icons, names icons of Christ, the Holy Mother, angels, and saints, but says nothing about icons of God or of the Trinity. This Page 6 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p501"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> <b class="calibre3">(p. 478) </b>was not an oversight: the Fathers of the Council did not admit that one could think of doing it (Bœspflug 1998c). For them, God as such, and  <i class="calibre4">a fortiori</i> his Triunity, remained unrepresentable. The only conceivable and legitimate icon of God is God incarnate in Jesus Christ. Artists had long respected this gold standard regarding the Christian representation of God. A good example of the kind of icon of Christ of which the Council approved is the  <i class="calibre4">Pantocrator</i> of Saint Catherine of Sinai (Belting 1998: 179–81). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> An exploratory period begins in the ninth century. Especially in Carolingian manuscripts, and then in Anglo-Saxon ones (Raw 1997), various efforts to depict the intra-Trinitarian relations and the ‘divine missions’ appear, most notably in the  <i class="calibre4">Utrecht</i> <i class="calibre4">Psalter</i> and the copies made of it. One of these contains the  <i class="calibre4">Winchester Quinity</i> (Bœspflug 2008: 168), a profound but uncategorizable image without later influence, showing the Father and the Son meeting in the presence of a crowned woman, Mary or the personified Church, holding Jesus and crowned by a haloed Dove. This period comes to completion in beauty in the twelfth century, a key moment in the history of the Trinity in western art. It is then that the five main families of images of the Trinity came to birth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the ‘Throne of grace’ shows God the Father most often sitting, but sometimes standing, and holding before him the Crucified one on the cross, with the Dove occupying a variable position. The miniature in the Cambrai Missal,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1120 (Fig. 2), is one of the first </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘images of the Trinity’ in the sense defined above: the Trinity is its main subject. The artist, probably a monk, has made it so that the wings of the Dove in horizontal flight join the respective mouths of the Father and the Son, in order to visualize the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, the Latin conception of the procession of the third person  <i class="calibre4">ab utroque</i>. This iconographic type characterizes western art; it is unknown in eastern Christian art. It appears right away in many art forms (frescoes, miniatures, stained glass, liturgical paraphernalia); it is the only type of Trinity that will generate, from the end of the thirteenth century, a group of sculptures in the round (Rouen Cathedral,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1280; Fritzlar Cathedral,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1320) of which hundreds of exemplars are still extant in France and across Europe—it is even found in very modest churches, for instance in Brittany (Pearman, dissertation, 1974; Bœspflug 2000 and 2009c). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second family produced in the twelfth century is the ‘Psalter Trinity’, already sketched in the  <i class="calibre4">Utrecht Psalter</i> and in some frescoes. It shows the Father and the Son seated on the same throne ( <i class="calibre4">synthronoi</i>, in Greek), with the Spirit as a Dove between them. The formula gets its name from the beginning of Psalm 109 (‘The Lord has said to my lord: “Sit at my right hand while I make your enemies your footstool” ’), the most frequently cited verse—twenty times—in the New Testament (Gourgues 1978). This type will remain for a long time tied to a single artistic genre, the manuscript illustration which gave birth to it. One also finds it in eastern art, but less often than in the West. It will achieve ascendancy during the Renaissance, and finally prevail over the ‘Throne of grace’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the epoch of Baroque. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Image taken by CNRS-IRHT. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly, the ‘Paternity’ is inspired by the prologue of John's Gospel: ‘No one has ever seen God; but the only Son,  <i class="calibre4">who is in the bosom of the Father</i>, has revealed him’ (Jn 1:18). It shows the Father sitting with the only Son in his ‘bosom’, before his chest or on his <b class="calibre3">(p. 479) </b> knees, a little like the Virgin with Child. The ancestor of this depiction is in a manuscript dated ‘ <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1020’ (London, British Library, ms. Harley 603) (Bœspflug 2009a), where the Father holds the Son tightly to his breast, cheek by jowl, like some icons of the Virgin holding the Infant Jesus. The Paternity is attested from the end of the eleventh century in the East (miniature, Vienna, ms. Suppl. Gr. 52, twelfth century, (Bœspflug 2008: 142); icon of Novgorod) and in the West (Ostrov Psalter). This iconographic type will survive until the beginning of the fifteenth century (miniature,  <i class="calibre4">Heures de Rohan</i>). But it then disappears, though not as a result of any ecclesiastical condemnation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourthly, the ‘Triandric Trinity’ shows the three persons in human form, side by side, sitting or standing. At the beginning, they are identical, like triplets (the creative Trinity, a miniature in the  <i class="calibre4">Hortus deliciarum</i>, end of the twelfth century; Vallepietra fresco) (D’Achille 1991; Silvestri 2008). Later on, there will be a tendency to free this type from the hieratic ‘face-forward’, and so to allow the Persons to engage with each other and to form a more clearly unified group, often concelebrating at the altar in a supple and familiar way, which will lead also to the differentiating of their attributes and/or their ages <b class="calibre3">(p. 480) </b>(group sculpted in wood, Troyes). The trajectory of these triandric Trinities continues up to the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Fifthly, tricephalous depictions in the strict sense are ones which show the Trinity as one person endowed with three separate heads. They first appear in sculpture (capital relief, Alquezar cloister, near Huesca in Aragon), then in illustrated manuscripts (Hospitality of Abraham, Cambridge) (Bœspflug 1998b) (Fig. 3). They are then supplanted by tri-faces, containing a head with three faces, sometimes used in philosophical allegories (of prudence), but more often, from the thirteenth century, in the iconography of the Devil (in the  <i class="calibre4">Bible moralisée</i>, and in illustrations of the  <i class="calibre4">Divine Comedy</i>), then in the fourteenth century in pictures of God (miniature, antiphonary, fifteenth century). They enjoy a huge diffusion in popular art (Flanders painting), not only in the West but also in the East, in the art of the icon (Belgrade, 1704), and in the art of the ‘mission countries’ (Bœspflug 2008: 462). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 481)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> The thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries constitute a period of flowering, in which the pictorial formulas that had appeared since the twelfth century spread and were differentiated (Fig. 4:  <i class="calibre4">Trinità</i>, by Nicoletto Semitecolo). The art of the West distanced itself from the art of the icon. At the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century, the West had another very inventive phase in the creation of new images: three types of suffering Trinity (the Double Intercession, the Mystical Winepress, and the Compassion of the Father), and a theme of glory, that of the Coronation of the Virgin by the Trinity. The first two disappeared during the seventeenth century; the last two have had a widespread diffusion down to our own times. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Intercession shows the Man of Sorrows on his knees before the Father, showing the wound in his side and interceding alone or with Mary showing her bared breast (Bœspflug 1997a). The Mystical Winepress sets the ‘pressed’ body (standing or lying) of the Redeemer in the vat of the Father, the ‘Vine-dresser’ (Bœspflug 1990). The  <b class="calibre3">(p. 482)</b> Compassion of the Father shows God the Father carrying the dead Christ, brought down from the Cross. In the  <i class="calibre4">tondo</i> of Jean Malouel, in the Louvre ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1400; Bœspflug 2008: 247), followed twenty years later by several works of Robert Campin (Bœspflug 2008: 263–7) which gained a following, the ‘dead but alive’ Christ figure opens out the gap of the wound in his side to present it for the devotion of the faithful as the source of the Eucharist and, more generally, of Redemption: this is shown in one of the panels of the Saint Petersburg Diptych. Unknown before the 1400s, this type of composition was very popular during the second half of the fifteenth century (Bœspflug 1992 and 1999). Emile Mâle saw it as a ‘Pietà of the Father’. An engraving by Dürer from 1511 (Bœspflug 2008: 297), which spread across Europe and even to the Americas, inspired many works of art, among which, more that fifty years later, was a painting by El Greco that is installed in Madrid (Bœspflug 2007a). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Coronation of the Virgin by the Trinity likewise appears toward the end of the fourteenth century (in a painting by Pedro Nicolau, a painter from Valencia,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1410) (Pamplona 1970). Until then, it was Christ alone, or the Father alone, or an angel or two, who crowned the Mother of the Saviour. Henceforth, the Coronation by the Trinity gains a place and becomes known in many formulas: Coronation by Father and Son, or by the Son with the approval of the Father (Panel of Gentile da Fabriano,  <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1410, Brera), or by the Son in the presence of the Father and the Spirit (Jean Fouquet's miniature in the  <i class="calibre4">Heures</i> <i class="calibre4">d’Étienne Chevalier</i>) (Bœspflug 2008: 271), or by the anthropomorphic Three Persons to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p505"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> gether (alabaster panel, London). This subject gives rise to masterpieces (Enguerrand Quarton, Villeneuve-lès-Avignon). </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the end of the Middle Ages, therefore, it was quite common for the Trinity to be depicted. The Father wore the appearance of a venerable man bearing the ensigns of power (royal or imperial, or priestly: God the Father is depicted as pope) (Bœspflug 1991). It became normal to depict the Father as a man. The one who until then had been, in art, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘invisible of the Son’ becomes, as regards appearance, the Son's double, his twin brother or look-alike; then, starting from the fifteenth century, his father or grandfather. This spelt the end of the rule of Christomorphism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(5)</b> The last great period of Trinity-God in art runs from the sixteenth century to our own. It covers a less imaginative phase of diffusion marked by the progressive decline of the Trinitarian theme, at least in the West, which leads in the twentieth century to an eclipse of the theme in ‘high art’. The only creation of this period is the image called the ‘two Trinities’, the earthly and the heavenly (Murillo, 1617–82, painting), which comes from a comparison made by Jean Gerson ( <i class="calibre4">divinissima Trinitas Jesu, Joseph et Mariae</i>) and then by St Francis de Sales (in his  <i class="calibre4">Spiritual Conferences</i>): </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mary, Jesus, Joseph is an earthly Trinity which in some way represents the Holy Trinity’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One can isolate within this long period a first moment which flowed down to the last decades of the seventeenth century. The idea of the ‘Trinity-God’ still inspired great artists: even though they did not create new types, some of them continued to revisit the now traditional types. Not without talent: the Compassion, for example, inspired profound works from Rubens (Anvers) and Ribera (Madrid); the Coronation of the Virgin by the Trinity, from Velazquez (Madrid). These types were exported to the mission countries and <b class="calibre3">(p. 483) </b>became the object, from the beginning of the eighteenth century, of an artistic enculturation, especially in ‘New Spain’, in the Baroque art of Latin America (Compassion of the Father, Holy Family, Coronation of the Virgin, triandric Trinity)—so much so that a synod of Bogota, in 1775, put a stop to them by forbidding triandric Trinities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Europe, by contrast, beginning with the century of the Enlightenment, artists turned away from the theme, which took refuge in ‘the art of the Church’. The pictorial image of the Trinity lost its force, was etiolated, academicized, and fossilized. The decline of the theme after that only continued to grow: one can speak of a certain effacement of the Trinity in contemporary art. This has created the setting for the rediscovery and then for the enormous success of the Rublev Trinity in the Catholic world, and in all of western Europe (Bœspflug 2007b). From time to time, some original creations see the light of day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they pass unnoticed and lack connection with the thought of the Church and the history of the theme, and likewise with the experience of their own century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p506"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> <b class="calibre3">Theological Appraisal: Regulation, Reception, </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">and Usage of Images of the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b>  <i class="calibre4">Regulation</i>. In the Christian East, where the theology of the image is well developed and robust, images of the Trinity have been the object of solidly argued and ultimately very restrictive ecclesial decisions, especially in the Russian domain, where in Moscow, in 1928, the Rublev icon was finally declared the only acceptable icon of the Trinity, after the Paternity images had been judged inadmissible by the Moscow synods of 1551 and 1666 (Ouspensky 1980). In the West, however, the domain of vision images of God both gained and lost (not mutually exclusive notions in this case) from a profound lack of regulation, despite the effort of Pope Benedict XIV, much too late (1745), to formulate well-supported norms. For lack of anything better, ecclesiastical discipline took the place of a theology of the image, encouraging some images and condemning others, on the basis of deficient criteria, when debates about images arose. Yet at the same time, the West has seen a much more diversified iconographic flowering than has the East. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b>  <i class="calibre4">Reception</i>. Western images of the Trinity have been very popular, in the strongest sense of the term, including every level of society. The princes often led by example, with a great confidence in the Trinity, shown without reserve in the images which they commissioned and loved to display. They were often followed and imitated by the bourgeoisie, the clergy, and the simple faithful. Some media (wooden and stone statues, ivory or alabaster reliefs, pages of illuminated manuscripts, easel paintings, engravings, ex-voto, glass painting, medals, pious images, and so on) have given birth to thousands of images of the Trinity, a large quantity of which remain today (Bœspflug 2009c). Some of them have enjoyed a rapid diffusion, both in Europe and in the mission countries. These images have both expressed and nourished the profound faith of believers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 484) 3. </b>  <i class="calibre4">Re-reception</i>. They can still nourish the faith of Christians today, and can do so effectively, by means of their reproductions in Bibles or in illustrated catechisms. These reproductions are legitimate and profitable, so long as discernment is made regarding their theological value. The explosion of new technologies for the digital storage of the iconographic heritage makes opportune, indeed urgent, the contemporary Church's reflection on the opportunity of these ‘re-receptions’ of the images of God from elsewhere or from earlier centuries. But this reflection is in its infancy. All the old images are sincere and touching, and their use was understandable in their times, but one is permitted to think that not all of them are profitable today. Some exhibit an excessive familiarity, to the detriment of the transcendence of God. Others convey or connote an image of a God who is more or less cruel or perverse (Bœspflug 1990). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">4. </b> In any event, if each century can reuse the images of earlier times, no one is dispensed from having to reinvent the response of faith to the proclamation of the Gospel, in the language of contemporary images. This is what Vatican II suggested in its constitution on the divine liturgy ( <i class="calibre4">Sacrosanctum Concilium</i>), when it taught that Page 12 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p507"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Christian Visual Arts</b> the Church is not bound to any one style, but welcomes the images produced by the sensibility of every age (Bœspflug 2004). One could believe, at first sight, that the Trinity is a theme that has disappeared from the preoccupations of artists. But this is a doubly false impression, to the extent that, on the one hand, this theme has never ceased to stimulate the creation of artists, often ones who have remained unknown (Bœspflug 2010b), and, on the other hand, that many works are produced outside of the western world, of which books published in Europe and Northern America do not speak, but which have no less interest for the life and future of the Church (Maquivar 2006). </p>
