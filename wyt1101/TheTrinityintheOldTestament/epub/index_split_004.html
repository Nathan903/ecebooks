<p class="calibre1">This article examines the thoughts and views of Protestant Reformers on the Trinity. It highlights the efforts of the Reformers, in light of the new exegetical modes arising with the Renaissance, to articulate Trinitarian doctrine biblically with a focus on the economy of salvation rather than on metaphysical or logical debates  <i class="calibre4">per se</i>, although the Reformers engaged in those too when necessary. It considers the relationship between the Reformers and ecumenical Trinitarian orthodoxy and describes the shape of early Protestant Trinitarian thought as it is expressed in exegesis, dogmatics, and catechesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Protestant Reformers, Trinity, exegetical modes, economy of salvation, Trinitarian orthodoxy, Protestant Trinitarian, catechesis THE doctrine of the Trinity as received and confessed by the ecumenical Church was not a point of dispute between Rome and the Protestant Reformers. Despite occasional claims to the contrary, the major theologians of the Reformation era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1517–78), including Martin Luther (1483–1546), Philip Melanchthon (1497–1560), Martin Bucer (1491–1551), Ulrich Zwingli (1484–1531), Heinrich Bullinger (1504–75), Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499–</p>
<p class="calibre1">1562), and John Calvin (1509–64), embraced the Church's traditional doctrine and vigorously opposed the rising tide of anti-Trinitarianism that emerged in the sixteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the Reformers’ largely conservative stance towards the doctrine did not translate into a lack of interest in Trinitarian theology, nor did it contribute to a lack of doctrinal development. An analysis of the Reformers’ biblical commentaries, dogmatic treatises, and catechetical works reveals the opposite to be the case. Because they were committed to grounding all ecclesial dogmas in Holy Scripture, and because they were able to take advantage of the ‘new’ exegetical tools and methods of Renaissance humanism, early Protestant reception of Trinitarian dogma occasioned a new era of Trinitarian biblical interpretation which, in turn, influenced the exposition and defence of the Trinity in early Protestant dogmatics and catechesis. The present essay will attempt to demonstrate this claim in four sections: first, we will consider briefly the relationship between the Reformers and ecumenical Trinitarian orthodoxy (section 1); then, we will survey the shape of Page 1 of 14</p>

<p class="calibre1">early Protestant Trinitarian thought as it is expressed in exegesis (section 2), dogmatics (section 3), and catechesis (section 4). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 228) The Reformers and the Ecumenical Doctrine of the Trinity</b> The relationship between the Reformers and ecumenical Trinitarian orthodoxy has been a subject of debate since the sixteenth century. As early as 1537, Lausanne pastor Pierre Caroli ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1480– <i class="calibre4">c</i>.1545) accused Calvin, William Farel (1489–1565), and Pierre Viret (1511–71) of holding heterodox views of the Trinity in his  <i class="calibre4">La refutation du blaspheme des</i> <i class="calibre4">Farellistes contre la saincte Trinité</i> (Backus 2003: 179–80; Gordon 2009: 72–7). More recently, John Henry Newman identified Luther and Calvin as the ‘definite anticipation’ of the Socinian heresy (Newman 1968: 198–9). Though Calvin, Farel, and Viret were acquitted of heresy charges by Bernese pastors in December 1537, and though Newman's judgement reflects an unsympathetic reading Luther and Calvin, it must be acknowledged that the Reformers bear some of the blame for the ambiguity surrounding the question of their Trinitarian orthodoxy. Thus, for example, when Caroli demanded that Calvin subscribe to the ancient creeds, the Genevan Reformer displayed ‘a somewhat curious attitude’ (Wendel 1997: 165) and refused to do so. Similarly, both Luther and Bucer exhibited an occasional reticence toward using traditional terminology such as ‘Trinity’, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘person’, and ‘procession’, suggesting that clarity of expression and the avoidance of </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘godless quarrels’ would be better served by sticking to an exclusively biblical idiom (Muller 2003: 62–5; Kolb 2009: 60). Perhaps the most infamous example of ambiguity vis-à-vis Trinitarian orthodoxy comes from the 1521 edition of Melanchton's  <i class="calibre4">Loci communes</i> <i class="calibre4">theologici</i>. Therein, the Wittenberg theologian argued that the doctrine of the Trinity does not belong to ‘the essence of theology’ and therefore that the Christian should seek to know Christ by knowing ‘his benefits’, instead of seeking to comprehend divine mysteries such as the Trinity which are better ‘adored’ than ‘investigated’ (Pauck 1969: 20–2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The preceding examples present riddles for the interpreter of Reformation thought. Nevertheless they should not be viewed as reflecting doubt on the part of early Protestants regarding the truth, meaning, or importance of historic Trinitarian doctrine. According to Luther, the Trinity was among ‘the sublime articles of the divine majesty’ that were ‘not matters of dispute or contention’ between Catholic and Protestant churches (Tappert 1959: 291–2). In later editions of the  <i class="calibre4">Loci communes</i>, Melanchthon identified the ecumenical dogma of the Trinity as ‘the first article of faith’, the object of his sincere and eternal confession (Melanchthon 1982: xlix, 11). For Melanchthon and Calvin alike, God's triunity was that which distinguished the true and living God from idols (Melanchthon 1982: 3–10; Calvin 1960: 122). The Reformers, moreover, were committed to the doctrine's traditional modes of expression and to its propagation in the Protestant churches. Many of the major Protestant confessions produced in the sixteenth century employed traditional Trinitarian terminology and affirmed the early catholic creeds as reliable summaries of biblical teaching. Included in this category are the Augsburg Confes</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">sion, prepared by Melanchthon for Emperor Charles V in 1530, Luther's Schmalkald Articles (1537), the French Confession (1559), which was largely the product of Calvin's hand, the Belgic Confession (1561), and  <b class="calibre3">(p. 229) </b>the Thirty-Nine Articles (1562). Already in his 1536  <i class="calibre4">Christianae religionis institutio</i>, published the year before his conflict with Caroli, Calvin expressed what would become the mature position of the magisterial Reformers regarding technical Trinitarian vocabulary, arguing that such terminology is necessary both to refute heretics and to ‘explain nothing else than what is attested and sealed by Scripture’ (Calvin 1975: 62–6;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Muller 2003: 64–6). And in later controversies with anti-Trinitarians such as Michael Servetus (1511–53) and Giovanni Valentino Gentile (1520–66), Calvin applied the lessons learned in the Caroli affair, taking great pains not only to argue the biblical warrants for Nicene Trinitarianism, but also to demonstrate the orthodoxy of the ante-Nicene Fathers (Backus 2003: 106–13, 180; de Greef 2008: 160–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the Reformers’ clear commitment to ecumenical Trinitarian orthodoxy, we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the ambivalence they occasionally displayed toward the doctrine's traditional vocabulary and creedal symbols. This ambivalence is best explained by the struggle that early Protestants faced to ground Trinitarian dogma in biblical exegesis (Muller 2003: 17–19, 62, 71) and to communicate that dogma in a manner that remained transparent to the Bible's main subject matter and scope, the economy of salvation realized in Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Early Protestant Exegesis</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reformers’ material commitment to the doctrine of the Trinity was shaped by their methodological commitment to derive that doctrine from the sacred Scriptures. The latter commitment is comprehensible only in light of specific medieval antecedents related to the norms of theology, as well as certain Renaissance developments in biblical criticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With respect to the norms of theology, Heiko Oberman identifies in medieval theology two competing understandings of the relationship between Scripture and tradition that informed later Reformation debates. According to the first understanding, which Oberman labels ‘Tradition I’, there is perfect coinherence between Scripture and tradition: whereas Holy Scripture contains all doctrinal truth, tradition serves to explicate and transmit the truth that is wholly contained in Scripture. According to the second understanding, which Oberman labels ‘Tradition II’, Scripture and tradition represent two distinct sources of doctrinal truth that together comprise the totality of God's revelation (Oberman 2000: 361–412). At the time of the Reformation, Protestants appropriated the first understanding of the Scripture-tradition relation (Helmer 1999: 3, 18; Muller 2003: 21), whereas Tridentine Catholicism appropriated the second. The Reformers were also significantly influenced by the medieval theological trajectory, exemplified in Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) and Nicholas of Lyra (1270–1349), that emphasized the necessity of rooting <i class="calibre4">sacra doctrina</i> in Scripture's literal sense (Preus 1969; Muller 2003: 197). The rhyme, ‘ <i class="calibre4">Si</i> <i class="calibre4">Lyra non lyrasset, Lutherus non saltasset</i> (If Lyra had not lyred, Luther would not have danced)’, barely overstates the significance of this trajectory for the theology of the Reformers (Yarchin 2004: 98). It is here that a third influence on the Reformers’  <b class="calibre3">(p. 230)</b> Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinitarian biblical exegesis deserves mention. Though the influence should not be overstated (Rummel 2000; Mattox 2008), the ‘New Learning’ of Renaissance humanism provided early Protestant theologians with a number of tools, including critical editions of the text of the Old and New Testaments and the philological skills required to interpret that text, which served their attempt to ground ecclesial dogma in the literal sense of the Bible. The humanist slogan  <i class="calibre4">ad fontes</i> (‘to the sources’) well captured the Protestant desire to pierce through what it considered the cloud of churchly exegetical tradition in order to behold the pure light of the prophetic-apostolic text (Rummel 2009). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The confluence of these factors in Reformation-era exegesis was not without complication however. When the tools of the New Learning were applied to the Bible, the result was often a diminished number of proof-texts for the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. This was true not only in the case of the great Catholic scholar Erasmus (1466–1536) (Meijering 1983: 120–3). It was true in the case of Calvin as well. To be sure, Calvin regarded many of the classical Trinitarian proof-texts as solid bases for the doctrine. Nevertheless, he rejected many others, often concluding that such texts did not refer to God's triune nature but to his saving work  <i class="calibre4">pro nobis</i> through Christ the Mediator (Baars 2004: 291–308; Baars 2009: 247–9, 254–5). One example of this tendency is found in Calvin's comments on Heb. 1:3, a text commonly taken by the tradition to indicate the Son's eternal relation to the Father  <i class="calibre4">ad intra</i>. According to Calvin, the titles ascribed to Christ in this verse are not intended to teach us ‘of what Christ is in himself’. On the contrary, ‘these high titles </p>
<p class="calibre1">… bear a relation to us’; they are ‘given to Christ for our benefit … to build up our faith, so that we may learn that God is made known to us in no other way than in Christ’. While Calvin stresses the evangelical import of this passage and denies that it speaks directly concerning the internal relations of the Father and the Son, he argues nonetheless that the author's use of  <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> in Heb. 1:3 ‘sufficiently confutes the Arians and Sabellians’, teaching both ‘that the Son is one with God the Father, and that he is yet in a sense distinct from him, so that a subsistence or person belongs to both’ (Calvin 1998, vol. 22: 35–</p>
<p class="calibre1">7;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Calvin 1998, vol. 21: 149–50). Calvin exhibited an even greater degree of reticence toward finding Trinitarian warrants in the Old Testament, a fact that earned him the title <i class="calibre4">Calvinus iudaizans</i> (‘Calvin the Judaizer’) from Lutheran theologian Aegidius Hunnius (1550–1603) (Puckett 1995; Pak 2010: 103–24). This reticence is especially clear in his commentary on the Psalms, where the Genevan Reformer's primary focus with respect to the doctrine of God is upon God's fatherly mercy, not Christology or pneumatology (Selderhuis 2007: 45–60; Pak 2010: 82–4, 85–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Erasmus’ exegesis created for him a unique set of problems in relation to Catholic theologians (Rummel 2009: 281, 291–2), a decreased exegetical basis for Trinitarianism did not present the same problem for the Catholic exegete that it did for Protestants. On the one hand, Erasmus did not face the virulent anti-Trinitarian movement that the Reformers faced. On the other hand, because Erasmus was willing to rely upon the authority of the Fathers for his Trinitarian faith, he had less to lose as a result of his exegetical conclusions (but  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Levering 2008: 36–62). Such a route was not open for Protes</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">tant interpreters who sought to establish orthodox Trinitarianism on the basis of Scripture alone (Gerrish 1981: 79–80; Meijering 1983: 121–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 231) </b>The difficulty of relating orthodox Protestant exegesis with the new biblical criticism was clearly recognized by Luther. Though he initially appropriated the new exegetical tools with enthusiasm in pursuit of the Reformation cause, Luther eventually acknowledged the mixed nature of their results (Mattox 2008: 22–5). A much neglected aspect of Luther's later theology concerns his work of re-establishing the biblical bases for orthodox Trinitarianism. This work of re-establishment not only involved reassessing traditional Trinitarian proof-texts he had earlier in his career dismissed, now often following the readings of the Fathers and the Medieval Doctors, it also involved articulating a sophisticated theological hermeneutic that could account for the lively interplay between Scripture's diverse two-testament  <i class="calibre4">signa</i> and its self-revealing Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">res</i> (Helmer 2002; Mattox 2008). According to Luther, the knowledge of the triune God made manifest in the gospel and confessed in the creed must govern biblical interpretation, including the interpretation of the Old Testament (Luther 1957: 70–4; Mattox 2008). Central to Luther's hermeneutic at this point is the person of the Holy Spirit. According to Luther, the self-same Spirit who overhears the Father's eternal Word in the person of the Son inspired the Old Testament prophets to speak in human languages in order that we too may hear the triune voice:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Spirit, who knows the inmost depths of God, moves from inner-Trinitarian silence to outer-Trinitarian speech by building a seamless bridge to the speech recorded in the text. The Spirit knows no other speech than Christ's speech, yet the Spirit has no other words than the prophet's words. (Helmer 2002: 64;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. 51–</p>
<p class="calibre1">5, 63–4)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that ‘the Spirit has no other words than the prophet's’ invests the Hebrew text with Trinitarian significance, and this significance gave Luther the opportunity to put his own philological expertise to work. Thus, for example, in his 1543  <i class="calibre4">Treatise on the Last</i> <i class="calibre4">Words of David</i>, essentially a theological exposition of 2 Sam. 23:1–7, Luther takes the Hebrew text's threefold description of the divine speaker in verses 2–3 (‘the Spirit of the Lord’, ‘the God of Israel’, and ‘the Rock of Israel’) as more than a matter of poetic repetition. According to Luther, this threefold description is a revelation of God the triune speaker: ‘Thus all three Persons speak, and yet there is but one Speaker, one Promiser, one Promise, just as there is but one God’ (Luther 1972: 276). Similarly, in his 1532 lectures on Psalm 2, Luther rehabilitates the ancient practice of ‘prosopographic exegesis’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">and identifies the shift in speaking subject from ‘the Lord’ in verse 6 to his ‘King’ in verse 7 not simply as a common feature of Hebrew language but as evidence that the Spirit wished to teach us a lesson about the  <i class="calibre4">opera Trinitatis ad extra</i>, namely, that ‘God does everything through the Son. For when the Son preaches the Law, the Father Himself, who is in the Son or one with the Son, preaches’ (Luther 1955: 43;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Helmer 2002: 61–6, 69 </p>
<p class="calibre1">n. 49). Luther draws from this lesson concerning unified Trinitarian action a word of evangelical consolation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is useful to learn this, lest we think that the Father is disposed toward us otherwise than we hear from the Son, who surely cannot hate us, since he died for us…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[A]lthough the persons are different (that is, the Father is not the Son nor the Son the Father), nevertheless the will and the Word are the same. (Luther 1955: 51) <b class="calibre3">(p. 232) </b>Luther's Trinitarian interpretation of the Old Testament was largely continued in post-Reformation Lutheran dogmatics (Preus 1972: 131–8). His approach evoked severe criticism, however, from modern theologians (Bornkamm 1969: 261–6). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Early Protestant Dogmatic Theology</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Biblical commentaries, lectures, and treatises did not provide the only outlet for Protestant Trinitarianism in the sixteenth century. The Reformers employed a number of theological genres inherited from the tradition in order to expound and defend the doctrine of the Trinity. Luther, for his part, found in the medieval  <i class="calibre4">disputatio</i> an especially suitable format for training his doctoral students for the spiritual conflict ( <i class="calibre4">Anfechtung</i>) they would face as they argued with heretics and the devil (Helmer 2003: 133;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. White 1994; Helmer 1999: 41–120; Bielfeldt 2008). In the doctoral disputations of Erasmus Alberus (1543), Georg Major and Johannes Faber (1544), and Petrus Hegemon (1545), Luther engaged a series of dogmatic topics discussed in medieval theology, including reason's inability to comprehend God's triunity, the relationship between the unity of divine essence and the plurality of divine persons, the nature of theological language, and the question of whether in God it may be said that ‘essence generates essence’ (Hinlicky 2008: 191–</p>
<p class="calibre1">209). With respect to the latter question, Luther argued, contrary to Peter Lombard ( <i class="calibre4">c</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1100–60) and the fourth Lateran Council (1215), that an affirmative answer may be given, provided that the phrase is understood ‘relatively’ and not ‘absolutely’: ‘the essence does not generate or bring into being  <i class="calibre4">qua</i> essence but  <i class="calibre4">qua</i> person’ (Knuuttila and Saarinen 1999: 9). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another genre that proved useful to the Reformers’ theological agenda was that of the <i class="calibre4">loci communes</i>. The collection and orderly arrangement of dogmatic topics derived from biblical exegesis provided one of the primary formats whereby early Protestants elaborated their Trinitarian doctrine (Muller 2000; Muller 2003: 397–412). Melanchthon's discussion of the Trinity in the 1555 edition of his  <i class="calibre4">Loci communes</i>—the largest locus therein—</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins by stating that although the Trinity far transcends ‘the wisdom of all creatures, angels, and men’, God nevertheless designed human beings in such a way that they might truly know his triune nature (Melanchthon 1982: 11). This point later becomes the basis upon which Melanchthon develops a modest analogy for the Son's eternal generation, arguing that just as our thoughts are an ‘image’ of the things we contemplate, so the Son is generated as the essential image of the Father's self-contemplation (Melanchthon 1982: 13–14). As the discussion proceeds, he defines and distinguishes Trinitarian persons, affirming both the Son's eternal generation and the Spirit's procession from the Father and the Son, provides extensive discussion of the biblical bases of Trinitarian doctrine, and Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">presents a series of patristic testimonies in support of his argument (Melanchthon 1982: 11–28). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 233) </b>The length devoted to the doctrine of the Trinity in the 1555  <i class="calibre4">Loci communes</i> is noteworthy, given its absence in the 1521 edition of the work. Also noteworthy is the extent to which the doctrine is integrated with other dimensions of the German Reformer's overarching theological program. A particularly elegant example of this integration comes when Melanchthon applies his Augustinian understanding of the Trinity's external operations to his Protestant ‘theology of the Word’. According to Melanchthon, while the external works of the Trinity are common to all three persons, each person nevertheless </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘has his own distinctive work’ corresponding to ‘the order of persons’ (Melanchthon 1982: 16; cf. 14–15). Consequently, when it comes to what Melanchthon's Swiss counterpart calls ‘the history of the proceeding of the word of God’ (Bullinger 1849: 49), the Second Person of the Trinity acts as the one through whom the Father ‘pronounced the order of creation and the salvation of men’ and through whom he ‘preserves the office of preaching, through which this person effectively works’ (Melanchthon 1982: 12–13). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melanchthon's concern to affirm both the undivided work of the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> and the ordered action of the persons within that undivided work is echoed in Vermigli's discussion of the incarnation (Muller 2003: 255–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Largely influenced by Melanchthon's work, Calvin's  <i class="calibre4">Institutes of the Christian Religion</i> ceased to be a catechetical manual in its 1539 edition and instead took on the form of a <i class="calibre4">loci communes</i> (McKee 1989; Muller 2000: 118–39). This new format provided Calvin with the opportunity to elaborate upon doctrinal topics treated only briefly in his commentaries and to engage at greater length in dogmatic disputation (Muller 2000). The locus on the Trinity underwent significant change and expansion throughout the numerous editions of the  <i class="calibre4">Institutes</i> until it reached its final form in 1559. These transformations reflect Calvin's lifelong work as a biblical commentator, his increasing interaction with the Fathers, and his debates with heretics such as Servetus and Gentile (Warfield 1956: 219–24; van Oort 1997: 664–84). In the 1559  <i class="calibre4">Institutes</i>, Calvin begins his discussion of the Trinity with a brief statement regarding ‘God's infinite and spiritual essence’ in order to restrain excess speculation and to remind readers of the accommodated nature of divine revelation. He then identifies triunity as the mark that more precisely distinguishes God from idols, introduces the disputed concept of ‘person’ by way of a few brief comments on Heb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1:3, defends the legitimacy of using non-biblical terminology in theological discourse, and defines a divine ‘person’ as ‘a “subsistence” in God's essence, which, while related to others, is distinguished by an incommunicable quality’. In the two sections that follow, Calvin traces in sequence the scriptural witness to the deity of the Son and the Spirit. He then proceeds to discuss the unity, distinction, and mutual relationships of the three persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this section, the Reformer questions the long-standing practice of drawing analogies </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘from human affairs’ to illumine the distinctions between the persons, preferring instead to distinguish them in accordance with their outward order of operation: from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit. This section ends with a ‘brief’ and ‘useful’ summary of the doctrine. With his constructive exposition of the doctrine in place, Calvin concludes the Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">locus on the Trinity with an extended polemic against the Trinitarian heresies of the ancient Church and of his own day (Calvin 1960: 120–59; Warfield 1956: 223–4). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 234) </b>Interpreters of Reformation theology often note that early Protestant dogmatics tends to emphasize the Trinity in its external works, particularly the work of redemption, over against the Trinity in itself (Butin 1995; Bayer 2008: 334–45). The Reformers’ emphasis in this regard corresponds to their desire to ground Trinitarian doctrine in biblical teaching, where God's redeeming work is central, and to avoid any speculation that would transgress biblical boundaries. Thus, according to Luther, if we would seek to know God in his infinite majesty without erring and without being ‘crushed’, we must ‘touch and lay hold of the Son of God manifest in the flesh’ (Hinlicky 2008: 197). Similarly, Calvin argues that the experience of the incarnate Son's work in quickening, justifying, and sanctifying the sinner provides ‘more certain and firmer’ proof of his divinity ‘than any idle speculation’ (Calvin 1960: 138). Nevertheless, the Reformers’ emphasis on the  <i class="calibre4">opera</i> <i class="calibre4">Trinitatis ad extra</i> does not come at the expense of the  <i class="calibre4">Trinitas ad intra</i>. The ‘immanent Trinity’ is a consistent theme of Luther's theology, spanning his exegetical, dogmatic, and catechetical labours (Helmer 1999; Helmer 2003). Even Calvin, who is more reticent to find the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">in se</i> within Scripture than much of the exegetical tradition that precedes him, and who in his  <i class="calibre4">Institutes</i> commonly distinguishes the divine persons by means of their outward order of operation, consistently affirms the doctrines of the Son's eternal generation and the Spirit's dual procession (Baars 2004: 669–72; Helm 2004: 46–50). For early Protestant dogmaticians, the distinction between the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">ad intra</i> and the Trinity <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> does not mark out the dividing line between biblical revelation and unwarranted speculation, as it does for many theologians operating on the presuppositions of modern German idealism (Gerrish 1981: 77–80; Helmer 1999: 15–25; Helmer 2003: 129–31; Helm 2004: 11–50). For early Protestant dogmaticians, the doctrine of the immanent Trinity is a deliverance of biblical revelation, something God wants us to know (Helmer 1999: 18 n. </p>
<p class="calibre1">66; Mattox 2008: 36). Indeed, in Luther's judgement, it is the revelation of the triune God as he is in himself that ultimately illumines the meaning of his outward actions towards his creatures (Helmer 1999: 190, 211–15). The contrast at this point between Luther and much contemporary Trinitarian theology could not be sharper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luther's 1538 work,  <i class="calibre4">The Three Symbols or Creeds of the Christian Faith</i>, well illustrates the Reformer's understanding of the Trinity in its internal relations and outward operations (Luther 1960: 201–29). Following ‘the theologians’, Luther identifies two ways in which the Scriptures differentiate the divine persons. The first way concerns the Son's </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘immanent birth’ and the Spirit's ‘immanent procession’. These occur ‘within the Godhead’ and preserve God's ‘one single, undivided, and unseparated substance’. According to Luther, the doctrine of God's immanent processions ‘is not even comprehensible to the angels’, and ‘those who have tried to grasp it have broken their necks over it’; nevertheless, he insists, it is a doctrine ‘given to us in the gospel’ and glimpsed ‘by faith’. The second way the Scriptures differentiate the divine persons is by means of the Son's ‘physical birth’ of his mother and the Spirit's ‘physical procession’ in the form of a dove at Jesus’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">baptism and in the fiery tongues at Pentecost. These occur ‘outside of the Godhead, in the creatures’. According to Luther, each person's outward appearance is ‘an external like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ness or image of his internal essence’. The reason, moreover, that the Son and the Spirit </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘have and keep the very same terms of differentiation when they reveal themselves <b class="calibre3">(p. 235) </b>to us’ is due to the fact that it is ‘the same Son of God in both births’ and ‘the same Holy Spirit in both kinds of proceeding’ (Luther 1960: 216–18;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Emery 2007: 338–</p>
<p class="calibre1">412). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As noted above, Calvin commonly distinguished the divine persons on the basis of their external operations. But, as also noted, he did not fail to distinguish the divine persons on the basis of their internal operations. With the topic of the Trinity's internal operations, we meet one of Calvin's most controversial and misunderstood  <i class="calibre4">theologoumena</i>, his view regarding the Son's status as ‘God of himself’. Calvin criticized Nicaea's formulation that the Son is ‘God of God’. According to the Reformer, preserving the full deity of the Son requires us to confess that he is  <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>, God of himself (Warfield 1956: 230–50; Muller 2003: 324–6). Some interpreters have seen in this teaching a radical corrective to Nicene Trinitarianism and consider it to be Calvin's distinctive contribution to Trinitarian doctrine (Warfield 1956: 251, 257, 273; Reymond 1997: 324–41; but  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Reymond 2001: 323–</p>
<p class="calibre1">42). This understanding of the Reformer probably overstates the significance of his teaching on this point. Calvin's criticism of Nicaea concerns the form, not the substance, of the Creed and does not entail a rejection of the doctrine of eternal generation (Warfield 1956: 249; Baars 2004: 705). Moreover, this understanding of Calvin fails to appreciate both the nature of pro-Nicene Trinitarianism, which is thoroughly anti-subordinationist (Ayres 2004: 21, 362–3), and the fact that Calvin's view stands in continuity with certain medieval developments in Trinitarian thought, which also sought to account for the ingenerate nature of the Son's divine essence (Wendel 1997: 167 n. 54; Muller 2003: 35–7, 54, 87, 326;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Marshall 2004). For Calvin, the fact that the Son is ‘God of himself’ reflects a truth about his consubstantial divine essence, where all divine attributes—including divine a-seity—are one; whereas the fact that he is ‘begotten of the Father’ reflects a truth about his unique divine personhood (Calvin 1960: 143–4, 153–4). Calvin's Trinitarian ‘development’ at this point thus represents an exercise in classical Nicene Trinitarianism, intended to preserve the Son's consubstantial deity without denying his personal distinction. Regardless of this fact, Calvin's doctrine continued to be a cause of controversy, not only among Reformed theologians, but also between Reformed, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic theologians into the eighteenth century (Warfield 1956: 252–84; Muller 2003: 326–32). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Early Protestant Catechesis</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For the Protestant Reformers, the doctrine of the Trinity was not merely a topic for classroom disputations and dogmatic handbooks (Helmer 2003: 143). It was a doctrine that was to be taught in the Church and transmitted to all the faithful, including children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing to the Duke of Somerset in 1548, Calvin explained the need for catechesis: ‘the Church of God will never preserve itself without a Catechism, for it is like the seed to keep the good grain from dying out, and causing it to multiply from age to age’ (Calvin 1983: 191;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Tappert 1959: 358–62). The Reformers’ catechetical labours resulted in the Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Reformers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">production of catechisms, sermons, and commentaries, commonly structured around the Apostles’ Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer. Many of the themes already surveyed appear in these works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As in the case of their exegetical and dogmatic counterparts, Protestant catechetical literature regularly employs traditional Trinitarian vocabulary, even as it seeks to expound the sense of this vocabulary by means of the Scriptures. Thus, in his sermons on the Apostles’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Creed, Bullinger commends ‘the holy fathers’ for confessing ‘that the Son is of the same substance with the Father’, and then confirms this confession by commenting on what he regards as ‘most evident testimonies of the natural Godhead of Christ’ in John 5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Bullinger 1849: 128). Early Protestant catechetical texts also regularly distinguish the Trinitarian persons  <i class="calibre4">ad intra</i> from their works  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>: ‘We should … distinguish between the Spirit and the works he does or the gifts he gives’, Vermigli insists in his 1544 commentary on the Apostles’ Creed (Vermigli 1999: 31). Yet it is not only the distinction but also the relationship between the persons and their works that reveals the rich Trinitarian piety of Reformation era catechesis. In response to the question concerning why we call God ‘Father’, Vermigli provides two reasons: ‘first, because he is the Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the second person of the Godhead; the other reason is that it has pleased him to be called our Father, since he shares with us both likeness and inheritance’ (Vermigli 1999: 8–9;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Bullinger 1849: 125; Schaff 1996: 315–16). In a similar fashion, Calvin's 1538 catechism distinguishes the Son of God from those who are sons ‘merely by adoption and grace’, and then goes on to relate Christ's Sonship to ours, stating that ‘he put on our flesh in order that having become Son of Man he might make us sons of God with him’ (Hesselink 1997: 23). According to Luther, in the three articles of the Creed, ‘God himself has revealed and opened to us the most profound depths of his fatherly heart, his sheer, unutterable love…. Moreover, having bestowed upon us everything in heaven and on earth, he has given us his Son and his Holy Spirit, through whom he brings us to himself’. In other words, the triune God ‘gives himself completely to us’ (Tappert 1959: 419–20;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Schaff 1996: 314). </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article explores Catholic and Protestant Trinitarian theology from 1550 to 1770. It discusses various issues, from the mystical visions of Ignatius of Loyola to the Augustinian approach of Jonathan Edwards. It considers the growing variety of eclectic views and the influence of anti-Trinitarian thinkers, beginning with Michael Servetus and Faustus Socinus. It also highlights the rise of confessionalism and anti-Trinitarianism and the explosion of mystical theology during this period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, Catholic, Protestant, Ignatius of Loyola, Jonathan Edwards, Michael Servetus, Faustus Socinus, confessionalism, anti-Trinitarianism, mystical theology THE sixteenth century saw not only the Reformation and with it a sudden diversification of Christianity and the end of Christendom, but also for the first time in a thousand years a powerful and innovative anti-Trinitarian movement that spread with considerable speed (Schmidt-Biggemann 2007: 79–130). The obvious poles of Trinitarian theology in this era were therefore confessionalism and anti-Trinitarianism. However, there is a third, usually overlooked one: the explosion of mystical theology in all confessions and, with it, numerous different approaches to the mystery of the triune God, only a few of which can be touched upon here. The first part of this article will trace the developments within Catholicism, making it clear that it was easier for Catholic theology to maintain traditional Trinitarian belief than for the various Protestant denominations, which will be analysed in part two. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Catholicism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It was especially the twentieth century reform movement around Vatican II, which found its inspirations in patristic theology, that explicitly scorned the a-historical, allegedly monolithic thought of Baroque scholasticism, labelled it a fruitless project, and thus rejected a tradition of over three hundred years of faithful, diverse, and insightful theological enterprise. Some even accused early modern scholasticism and especially its treatise Page 1 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> <i class="calibre4">De Deo Uno</i> of paving the way for modern atheism due to its alleged demise of positive, biblical Trinitarian theology. These undifferentiated views have been challenged by the research of the last decades, mostly carried out by philosophers (Buckley 1987; Schäfer 1993; Muller 2003; Marschler 2007: 1–80). Baroque scholasticism is also often charged with being unoriginal and textbook-like. This however was the aim of this theological method, thus its name  <i class="calibre4">school theology</i> (Blum 1998). Trinitarian speculation had its peculiar place within it, especially in the treatises on the Trinity, but also in the questions which were treated in liturgical, mystical, Mariological, angelical, and Biblical theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 241) </b>Since the foundation of the Society of Jesus was one of the most crucial events of Early Modern Christianity, the Trinitarian theology of St Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556) can serve as a starting point for our brief overview. When Ignatius in Manresa saw the Trinity in the form of three musical keys, symbolizing divine harmony, it was only the beginning of a lifelong reflection on the Trinitarian mystery. In his  <i class="calibre4">Spiritual Exercises</i> one can find the image of the three persons on one throne, followed by an explication that the Incarnation is a work of all three persons. Ignatius furthermore acknowledged the grace of having seen the  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> of the three persons in a sun-like ball. He described the Trinity as a union of love, and creation as the gift of this love. However, his mysticism was rooted in his spiritual relationship with Christ, who is for him not only the manifestation of the triune love but also the key for the participation in the divine life. By serving Christ, one becomes one with him, and thus with the Trinity. Apostolic service and adoration of the Trinity coincide—that was the specific characteristic of Ignatian Trinitarian mysticism (Zechmeister 1985; Strucken, dissertation, 2001: 38–75). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Jesuit theology soon lost touch with the mystical tradition of its founder, the Jesuit authors treated the Trinity differently from other religious orders and thus tended to be more innovative. This derives from the  <i class="calibre4">Ratio Studiorum</i> (1586/91), which allows two opinions about the Trinitarian dogma to be discussed freely. A good example of Jesuit ingenuity is Francisco Suarez, S.J. (1548–1617), who also had enormous influence on Early Modern Protestantism. At the basis of his Trinitarian metaphysics was the insight that humans only have epistemological access to the Trinity through revelation. Thus, all the arguments he proposed are based on analogies or appropriations which presuppose revelation. In his treatise  <i class="calibre4">On Angels</i>, he reflected upon the question of how angels can come to know the Trinity if they do not possess natural knowledge of it. It was certain for him that the angels acquire a supernatural faith in God, in the short span of time after creation but immediately before their decision for or against God. Moreover he thought it highly probable that Adam in his original grace already had knowledge of the Trinitarian Mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such knowledge was for Suarez only quantitatively superior to every baptized Christian's knowledge in faith. Moreover, for Suarez God inserted Trinitarian wisdom into the Old Testament in order to prepare his chosen people for the Incarnation. However, it was only after the explicit revelation of the Trinity through Jesus Christ that belief in the dogma became necessary for obtaining salvation. In  <i class="calibre4">On the Incarnation</i>, Suarez also speculated on the Trinitarian knowledge of Christ during his earthly life. In  <i class="calibre4">On the Mysteries of</i> <i class="calibre4">Christ's Life</i>, he reflected upon Mary's knowledge of the Trinity: in contrast to her son, she did not have an earthly  <i class="calibre4">vision</i> of it, but did have perfect faith, which included an Page 2 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> equally perfect assertion of belief in the Trinitarian mystery—an axiom Luther vehemently denied. Erasmus’ opinion that Mary did not adore Jesus as Divine immediately after birth since she was still ignorant of his Divinity was for Suarez outright heresy (Marschler 2007: 81–115). Regarding the  <i class="calibre4">immanent</i> Trinity, Suarez maintains that the acts of the Divine nature, which constitute the persons, are  <i class="calibre4">necessary but also free</i>—in the Trinitarian act of love there exists no difference between the two. This of course has consequences for his theological anthropology since the Trinity is used as proof that necessary actions of a personal will are compatible with  <b class="calibre3">(p. 242) </b>the freedom of that will, such that freedom is more than choice (Marschler 2007: 712). Since all three persons act through their common nature  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i>, Suarez avoided the modalist trap, and through the strict separation of necessary intra-Trinitarian processes and creation he was able to maintain God's absolute freedom in regard to the world (Marschler 2007: 684). Regarding the distinction of the Trinitarian persons, Suarez argued for a  <i class="calibre4">virtual</i> distinction between person and nature in order to avoid an absolute person in God (Marschler 2007: 719). Suarez's understanding of Jesus Christ as the second person of the Trinity, however, was problematic: for him the son-relationship of the man Jesus is not constituted by the union of human nature and divine person, since the ‘being of the human person is none other than the being of the Logos, but by the grace following the Incarnation, which constitutes a special relationship of the human being Jesus Christ … to God as Trinity’ (Marschler 2007: 704). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closely connected with the critique of Trinitarian thought—despite his orthodoxy—and a renewal of positive theology was Dionysius Petavius, S.J. (1583–1652). In  <i class="calibre4">De theologicis</i> <i class="calibre4">dogmatibus</i> (1644–50) he aimed to show how the Trinitarian dogma is founded upon the Bible and the post-Nicene Fathers. However, he also stated that Platonism had infiltrated Christian theology, especially the pre-Nicene Fathers. He was even convinced that most of these early Fathers contradicted the Nicene Creed and were Arians or Tritheists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomassin (see below) together with Jean-Francois Baltus, S.J. (1667–1743) defended the pre-Nicene Fathers against the charges of Petavius, but they did not reach the erudite level of the Maurist Prudentius Maranus, O.S.B. (1703–1778) (Werner 1867: 27). Petavius’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">ideas were of course immediately put to use in the anti-Trinitarian movements. One of the most influential authors was the Arminian minister Jacques Souverain (d. 1698), who in <i class="calibre4">Platonism Unveiled</i> (1700) followed Petavius’ critique of Platonic theology but went so far as to contrast the Jewish-Christian Divine Logos tradition with platonic thought: the Logos in John 1 was, for Souverain, relying on Socinian and Jewish exegesis, not the second person of the Trinity but the  <i class="calibre4">law</i> of God. Christ was therefore only a manifestation of this Divine law but not God incarnate. Catholic authors, not happy about Petavius’ outspoken ideas, from that point on carefully established in their textbooks the orthodox faith of the pre-Nicene Fathers (Berti 1770: 457–86). Positively, Petavius’ idea of history as  <i class="calibre4">vestigium</i> <i class="calibre4">Trinitatis</i> led to a sophisticated reflection on the development of dogma, namely his thoughts about the substantial indwelling of the Holy Spirit and thus of the Trinity to the acknowledgement that being a child of God is a gift of the Holy Spirit and not of the Divine nature. Moreover, Petavius modified the teaching of the actions of the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">ad extra</i> and introduced the concept of an exclusive mission of the Spirit and his connection with the human person. In all these regards he influenced the Tübingen School, John Page 3 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> Henry Newman, the Roman School (Passaglia and Schrader), and Matthias Scheeben (Chatellain 1884; Chadwick 1987: 58–60; Courth 1996: 34–41). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A different Jesuit innovation in Trinitarian theology was the so-called  <i class="calibre4">figurist theology</i> of the missionaries to China which stated that the Chinese religion entailed important elements of Christian wisdom. Jean Baptiste Duhalde, S.J. (1674–1743) in his highly influential  <i class="calibre4">General History of China</i> (1735) even went so far as to claim that in the pre-Christian <b class="calibre3">(p. 243) </b>Dao-de-jing the Trinity was anticipated. The papal rejection of the Jesuit attempts to reconcile Chinese religion and Christian faith in the so-called rite-controversy also meant an end of this experiment in interreligious Trinitarian metaphysics (Rowbotham 1956; Lackner 1991). Figurative theology, however, had an ongoing impact through Leibniz, Wolff, and Scottish Catholic Wolffian Andrew Ramsay (1686–1743), and even influenced Jonathan Edwards, who also came to believe in hints of Trinitarian belief among the Chinese (McDermott 2000: 207–16). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Louis Thomassin (1619–95), an Oratorian, derived his Trinitarian theology to a great extent from the works of his community's founder, Cardinal Pierre de Bérulle (1575–1629). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The latter's theology had stressed that through the connection of the justified Christian with Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit, one enters the life of the triune God (Cognet 1949: 58–65). Thomassin's Trinitarian theology was equally Christocentric: the baptized Christian receives the Holy Spirit and becomes a child of God. As Father and Son are united in the Spirit, so are the members of the Church united in the Spirit. This led him to the conviction that the personal indwelling of the Spirit widens the Incarnation and that the Church is the image of the hypostatic union. Consequently, in the Eucharist, the faithful also receive the life of the Father. Thus, Thomassin succeeded in connecting Trinitarian theology with Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and the doctrines of creation and grace in a fashion that follows salvation history rather than pure speculation, despite his clear preference for the platonic tradition. Moreover, he laid out one of the most consistent theologies of  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> in the western tradition. Thomassin's Trinitarian theology was founded upon the Bible, and on this ground he denied that any other person of the Trinity besides the Son could have been incarnated. For him, only the economic Trinity enables one to talk about the immanent Trinity (Lachenschmid 1968; Courth 1996: 41–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the Dominican Order, John of St Thomas (1589–1644) deserves mention, since he contributed lastingly to the progress of Trinitarian theology by explicating Aquinas’ idea of divine love between Father and Son and the consequent procession of the Spirit: The love that is the Holy Spirit proceeds from a love of friendship, the reciprocal love of friendship, the reciprocal love of the Father and the Son, the same love that accompanies the generation of the Word, and is common to the two persons inasmuch as it is the operation of love with only one identical motive, the infinite Goodness that is common to them, but though common yet in that it pertains to the Father it bears on the Son and in that it pertains to the Son it bears on the Father.

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> From the field of mystical theology, the Spanish Carmelites have certainly contributed most greatly to the Catholic tradition: the Carmelite nun St Teresa of Avila (1515–82) regarded the contemplative union with the triune God as a ‘spiritual marriage’. She described her way of contemplative progress towards a union with the triune God in the  <i class="calibre4">Interior Castle</i>, not to mention in her autobiography. In the seventh stage, the mystic receives, according to Teresa, a specific knowledge about the Trinitarian mystery by means of an intellectual vision, in which the soul realizes that ‘all these three Persons are <b class="calibre3">(p. 244) </b>one Substance and one Power and one Knowledge and one God alone … all three Persons communicate themselves to the soul and speak to the soul’ (Teresa of Avila 1961: 209–10). Teresa's most important Trinitarian visions occurred between 1567 and 1582: she received insight into the indwelling of all three Trinitarian persons in the soul of the mystic, the way in which the soul becomes one with the Trinity, and increasingly perceived the unity and  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> of the Trinity. Moreover, after her spiritual marriage she felt that her soul ‘rests’  <i class="calibre4">in</i> the mystery of the Trinitarian God (Strucken, dissertation, 2001: 76–134). For her Carmelite companion St John of the Cross (1542–91), God created the world in order to communicate his love and, more explicitly, in order to give the Son the human soul as a bride. However, the imitation of the suffering Christ in the ‘dark night of the soul’ is the only way to the Father. Christ as the bridegroom of the soul communicates knowledge, gifts, and virtues to the soul of the mystic and accompanies her, while the Spirit, who is aspirated by the bridegroom, perfects the union of the soul with God, which John called ‘divinization’. For him and for almost all Spanish Trinitarian mystics, the Father was the goal of mystical union. To him all creation is on pilgrimage with the Son and the Spirit (Strucken, dissertation, 2001: 135–202; Faraone 2002). The Trinitarian implications of the Sacred Heart mysticism of St Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647–90) also proved to be of tremendous influence, since the heart was for her the symbol of the Logos’ divine Person in humanity, which recapitulated the passion of Christ, his sanctifying action through the Church, and his eschatological gift of himself in the future. Thus, it became an icon of the Trinity (Ciappi 1959; Margerie 1982: 347–8). Moreover, the visionary insights of Marie de l’Incarnation, O.S.U. (1599–1672) deepened theology's understanding of the conjugal analogy of the Trinitarian mystery (Mali 1996). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite its diversity, the scholastic approach to Trinitarian theology was criticized early on from within the Church, for example by the French Oratorian Pierre Faydit (1644–</p>
<p class="calibre1">1709), who accused scholasticism of modalism and the early Fathers of tritheism, or by Martin Gerbert, O.S.B. (1720–93) and Placidus Stürmer, O.S.B. (1716–94) (Faydit 1696, 1702; Gerbert 1758; Stürmer 1760). Radical reinterpretations of Trinitarian theology did not happen until the eighteenth century, when the  <i class="calibre4">Catholic Enlightenment</i> evolved, e.g. in the work of Anton Oehms (1735–1809), who proposed that each person corresponds to one substance (Schlich 1906–7). Among the French Catholic theologians, the most prominent and ingenious case was Isaac Berruyere, S.J. (1681–1758), whose  <i class="calibre4">History of the People of God</i> (1728–55) was a narrative theology of salvation history, which minimized the importance of the Fathers and of tradition in order to enable the papacy to define the faith according to the Bull  <i class="calibre4">Unigenitus</i>—a theological vision which Berruyere inherited from his teacher Jean Hardouin, S.J. (1646–1729)—and which, together with his hetero</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> dox positions, led to the formal censoring of his work in 1734 and 1755. In 1758, Benedict XIV forbade all parts and all translations of this work; the accused theologian recanted. In Trinitarian terms Berruyere's Christology was especially questionable since he understood Jesus Christ as the Son of God who subsists in three persons and not as Son of the Father as the first person of the Trinity—thus Jesus was for him the Son of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since God in three Persons united the Logos, the only ‘natural Son’, to the humanity of Christ, Jesus Christ is  <i class="calibre4">made</i> in time and is not Son because of the Logos’  <b class="calibre3">(p. 245) </b>pre-existence from all eternity. This proposition is taken from Hardouin, namely his commentary on the New Testament. This of course leads to the consequence that Jesus Christ had two fathers: as natural Son of God, he had the first person of the Trinity as Father; but as Son made in time he had God in three persons as Father. A further conundrum is that, for Berruyere, during the three days in the sepulchre Jesus Christ ceased to be a living man: thus, the human nature was separated from the Logos (Liguori 1857: 597–633; Schäzler 1870: 201–3; Palmer 1961: 65–76). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Protestantism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The anti-Trinitarians of the sixteenth century understood themselves as radical reformers of Christianity who were completing the unfulfilled task of Luther and Calvin, namely a purification of the concept of God from all non-scriptural influences. The earliest important anti-Trinitarian was Miguel Servet (1509–53), burnt for his  <i class="calibre4">Christianismi restitutio</i> (1553). He denied the triple personhood of God as early as 1531, and taught an Arian Christology (Friedman 1978; Hillar and Allen 2002; Sánchez-Blanco 1977). More important, however, became the Italian Faustus Soccini (1539–1604), who developed the anti-Trinitarian ideas of his uncle Laelio into a system. His basic conviction was that the existence of three persons in one nature was contradictory. Socinus’ Christianity, which was based on good works, since atonement through Christ was not accepted, was founded upon a strict Biblicism that lacked any regulative principle except the principle of non-contradiction. This also led him and his followers to a denial of the divine attribute of eternity in so far as it is understood with the scholastics as an enduring present moment. For Socinian Unitarianism, eternity had to be understood as successive duration—an innovation that anticipated process thought and open theism. In Poland, the Socinians formed a loose Church under the name  <i class="calibre4">Polish Brethren</i>, whose  <i class="calibre4">Racovian Catechism</i> (1605) was their official confessional charter. Over the next two hundred years, anti-Trinitarianism spread throughout eastern Europe, especially in Transylvania, but also to the Netherlands, England, and Germany and, with its strong belief in freedom of conscience and freedom from authority, became a driving force of the Enlightenment (Wilbur 1946; Muller 2003; Rohls 2005; Mulsow 2002; Knijff 2004). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the seveteenth century, Arminian theology from the Netherlands, but also Socinian thought from Poland, started to transform English theology, especially in regard to its metaphysics and its rejection of speculations about the immanent Trinity. Moreover, Descartes's principle of conceptual evidence and self-certainty as starting points for any rational enterprise made Trinitarian theology appear to be an irrational enterprise, and Page 6 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> his dualism introduced a philosophy of mind that undermined any ontological definition of the human, but also the Divine persons (Scheffczyk 1967; Leahy 2003: 19–37). The Civil War (1641–51) created an atmosphere in which extreme religious and philosophical ideas flourished, as evidenced by the publication of Thomas Hobbes's (1588–1679)  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i> in 1651. For Hobbes, himself heavily influenced by Descartes, the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 246) </b>Trinity was an unclear, indeed artificial concept, not central to Christianity. Moreover, he reintroduced the Ciceronian understanding of the person-as-actor and understood it no longer as subsistence, which rendered traditional Trinitarian theology problematic. The Cambridge Platonists, especially Ralph Cudworth (1617–88), defended the Christian Trinity by relying on the traditional  <i class="calibre4">theologia prisca</i>, which detected traces of the Trinity in ancient wisdom and the Old Testament. Their emphasis on moral activism, which somewhat marginalized the Trinity, and their understanding of creation as emanation from the ultimate, triune monad (Taliaferro 2003; Muller 2003: 100–1) were problematic, however. Among the English Puritan theologians, John Owen (1616–83) deserves special attention, since he applied his ingenious combination of eastern and western Trinitarian theology rigorously to Christian piety, and thus conceived a highly sophisticated, thoroughly biblical theology of communion with the triune God (Trueman 1998). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of another political crisis, immediately before and after the  <i class="calibre4">Glorious Revolution</i> (1688) and thus in close connection with anti-Catholic sentiments, Stephen Nye (1648–1719) published  <i class="calibre4">A Brief History of the Unitarians</i> (1687), in which he asserted that the Trinity was an unnecessary, and moreover irrational, dogma. Nye and others were furthermore convinced that belief in the Trinity had contributed to the decline of Christianity, since it had corrupted the Gospels and embraced polytheism. Briefly before, in 1685, Bishop George Bull (1634–1710) had unsuccessfully attempted to defend the dogma in his  <i class="calibre4">Defence of the Nicene Faith</i>, in which he argued that the Church had always believed and taught the explicit Trinitarian doctrine of Nicaea. As a response to Nye, in 1690 the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London, William Sherlock (1641–1707), published his famous  <i class="calibre4">Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity</i>. However, instead of helping the Trinitarian cause, his book started one of the biggest crises of modern theology, especially because Sherlock aspired to explain the Trinity in easily understandable but  <i class="calibre4">new</i> terms. Thus, he stated that the three persons are three infinite minds, each of which has a self-consciousness of its own, which is distinct from the others. The unity of the three persons lies in the fact that these three minds are aware of each other, in a mutual-consciousness, which ‘ensures that ad extra is one will, energy and power’ (Dixon 2003: 114). Critics, however, remarked that consciousness cannot be the formal reason for a Divine person since the latter is ontologically prior; moreover, if one followed Sherlock's stream of thought, there could be innumerable persons and minds in God; additionally, his real distinction of the divine persons (instead of a modal or virtual distinction) leads to tritheism. Among the debaters, Matthew Tindal (1655–1733) observed two camps:  <i class="calibre4">Nominal Trinitarians</i>, like Robert South (1634–1716), who were orthodox but irrational, and  <i class="calibre4">Real Trinitarians</i> like Sherlock, who were rational but tritheists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John Locke (1632–1704) held a concept similar to Sherlock's. Edward Stillingfleet (1635–</p>
<p class="calibre1">99), who defended the classical concept of person as a manner of subsistence with incom</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> municable properties in a common nature, consequently saw in Locke's philosophy of the person, but also in his undermining of the concept of sub-stance, the grounds for the rising denial of the Trinitarian dogma. Moreover, he publicly charged Locke with Socinianism (Montuori 1983; Marshall 1994). Eighteenth-century  <b class="calibre3">(p. 247) </b>rationalist, mostly Arian theology also contributed to the marginalization of the Trinity, for example Samuel Clarke's (1675–1729)  <i class="calibre4">The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</i> (1712). Clarke not only denies the existence of one indivisible divine essence, but also the idea of coeternal, distinctive persons, since the traditional terms were irreconcilable with the Newtonian understanding of extension (Muller 2003: 131). In order to defend the dogma against the charge of irrationalism or historical corruption, Trinitarians increasingly turned to a univocal language about the Trinitarian mystery and avoided the rich analogical tradition which had kept the dogma alive in public devotion. The Trinity became more and more a theological problem and almost vanished from Christian devotional life, also because the cause lacked any popular apologist. The structural problem of Anglicanism as the embodied compromise between Puritanism and Catholicism made it inevitable to follow the steadily narrowing concept of reason as the key to interpreting the scriptural sources for Trinitarian theology. The road was set for subordinationist and Unitarian tendencies (Mulsow 2002: 275–6), and, in this setting, it comes as no surprise that as early as 1718 the English Presbyterians had already split into a Trinitarian and a Unitarian/semi-Arian Church (Dixon 2003; Muller 2003: 94–135). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the structure of the treatises on the Trinity, Lutheran theology followed to a great extent the Catholic tradition with minor changes. With Johann Gerhard's (1582–1632)  <i class="calibre4">Exegesis of the Articles of Faith</i> (1626), however, the treatment of Trinitarian theology began to take a new shape. Gerhard still followed traditional belief, e.g. that the persons’ modes of subsistence are identical with their intra-Trinitarian relations, but he split the theological exposition of the dogma now into prolegomena, onomatology, and pragmatology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas the prolegomena contained the main axioms, e.g. the necessity of the doctrine for salvation, onomatology laid out a clarification of the terminology. Here, Gerhard insisted that theologians should only use terms that were already received by the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pragmatology then proved the Trinity from Scripture. Despite the heavy emphasis on the scriptural proof of the Trinity, orthodox dogmatic theology never gave up central scholastic axioms, that is, the virtual differentiation between divine nature and persons or the personal order within the Trinity ( <i class="calibre4">ordo personalis</i>) (Schäfer 1983: 122–41; Ratschow 1966: 84). Dissenters from this classical outline, like Jakob Böhme (1575–1624), who explained the Trinity voluntaristically in his main Trinitarian work  <i class="calibre4">The Three Principles of</i> <i class="calibre4">the Divine Essence</i> (1619) and who consequently influenced Rosicrucians and Spiritualists, as well as Pierre Poiret (1646–1719), who applied an ingenious combination of rational psychology and theology to the Trinitarian mystery, were exceptions (Krieg 1979; O’Regan 2002). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the Reformed Tradition, Jacob Arminius’ (1560–1609) contribution to Trinitarian thought is usually overlooked in favour of his demolition of the belief in predestination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, his explanation of the Trinity argued that God the Father had  <i class="calibre4">aseitas</i>, life in himself. When the Son is begotten, the Father communicates to the Son this essence, and Page 8 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> therefore it is the former's  <i class="calibre4">exclusive</i> attribute. The Son therefore cannot be  <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arminius thus started a controversy that asked the fundamental theological question of <i class="calibre4">what</i> was generated in the generation of the Son, and made clear that the Remonstrants differed from Reformed Orthodoxy, which with Calvin and Lucas  <b class="calibre3">(p. 248) </b>Trelcatius (1542–</p>
<p class="calibre1">1602) claimed that the generation of the Son was one of ‘sonship, and that the divine essence, belonging to the three persons in common, was itself ingenerate, and that the Son, … as God has the attribute of  <i class="calibre4">aseity</i> as well’ (Muller 2003: 87–8). Moreover, Remonstrants also gave up the Trinity as a fundamental article of faith, which not only led Lutheran Orthodox like Johann Friedrich König (1619–64) to assert that belief in the Trinity was necessary for salvation, without which no one could achieve salvation, but also increased popular catechesis in order to secure the Trinitarian belief among the faithful (Hauschild 1999: 439). However, Lutheran Orthodoxy also faced a number of theological problems: as a result of the Lutheran axiom of the ubiquity of the human nature of Christ, some theologians appropriated to the human nature divine omniscience and power. Georg Calixt (1586–1656), however, argued that the infinite nature of the Divine Being could not be communicated to a finite human nature, and that this Lutheran doctrine led to  <i class="calibre4">Eutychianism</i> (Baur 1843: 441–52). In his  <i class="calibre4">On the Trinity</i> (1649) Calixt also questioned one of the most cherished axioms of Lutheran orthodoxy, namely the scriptural proof of the Trinity from the Old Testament, which was due to the anti-Trinitarian controversies at the centre of the doctrine and thus one of the best- developed parts of Lutheran thought. For this move, he was criticized not only by fellow Lutherans but also by the reformed theologian Francis Turretin (1623–87), since the Socinians immediately put Calixt's arguments to use (Muller 2003: 92–3). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the vast majority of the Protestant tradition confirmed the doctrine  <i class="calibre4">a posteriori</i>, a few tried  <i class="calibre4">a priori</i> explanations. The reformed Bartholomew Keckermann (1572–1609), Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622), and Franz Burmann (1628–79) offered proofs of the Trinity by setting up a logic of the divine emanations. For Keckermann the object of God's intellect can only be God, since both have to be perfect. Thus, the divine intellect eternally reflects upon itself and has as object the perfect image of itself. Such an image, he continued, can properly be called a generation, since generation is ‘nothing other than the act of a substance, by which it produced from itself a like substance; when therefore God by conceiving of himself produces a substantial image of himself, this is rightly called the generation of that self-image’ (at Muller 2003: 163). Erhard Weigel (1625–99) attempted to explain the Trinity with mathematical theories but was forced to recant his ideas in 1679. It is, however, a common misconception that Leibniz (1646–1716) also gave a rationalist explanation of the Trinity. Rather, he defended the dogma against Socinians and Spinozists by showing the non-contradictoriness of Trinitarian faith. His apologetic strategy relied on the presumption of faith. This presumption of faith, however, was valid until a proof to the contrary had been given. Thus, the dogmas of the Church handed down through the centuries could be considered true ‘until it has been proved incontrovertibly that they are self-contradictory’ (Antognazza 2008: 20). Unfortunately, Leibniz’ theology remained an exception. The fact that theologies about the Trinity in the Protestant world became increasingly Biblicist, without offering an effective, rational exposition of the im</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> manent Trinity, contributed heavily to a fading of Trinitarian imagination, to anti-intellectual and ultimately modalist expositions of the Trinity in the Pietism of Samuel Urlsperger (1685–1772) or the mysticism of Emmanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) (Dorner 1878: 383–</p>
<p class="calibre1">4; Rohls 1997: 110), but especially to the surrender to the narrow, rationalist concept of reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 249) </b>A good example of this narrowing concept of reason is the ‘new scholasticism’ of Christian Wolff (1679–1754), whose eclectic use proved to be helpful for the orthodox theologies of Siegmund Jacob Baumgarten (1706–57) and Kant's teacher Martin Knutzen (1713–51) (Sorkin 2008: 113–65; Gómez-Tutor 2004). However, if one applied Wolff's mathematical method radically to theology, it led to rationalist outcomes, for instance in the theology of Johann Peter Reusch (1691–1758), who identified three principles in God, and thus a clear modalism (Baur 1843: 590–4), or Joachim Darjes (1714–91), who claimed that the Trinity was no mystery of faith but comprehensible with the means of natural theology and psychology (Bernet 2001). Similar things can be said about the Dutch Arminian Paul Maty, who in 1729 asserted that the second and the third persons of the Trinity were finite, created minds, only afterwards united with the always-existing infinite mind of the Father (Meier 1844: 81–2).The attempt of the medical doctor Gottlieb Berger to explain the Trinity (1778) with new analogies from natural science, e.g. the mixtures of certain chemical components, also did not support traditional Trinitarian faith but ended in modalism (Bretschneider 1819: 430–1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A further diminution of Trinitarian belief during the Enlightenment was due to the increasing historical critique of the Bible. While Johann Salomo Semler (1725–91) did not contribute content-wise to a better understanding of the Trinity, he emphasized the individual freedom of conscience in accepting the Trinitarian dogma and introduced the idea of the historical relativity of dogmatic decisions, including the realm of Trinitarian debate. For him, the Church Fathers were in no better position to judge the mysteries of the Faith than eighteenth-century thinkers (Powell 2001: 69–79). Lessing's (1729–81) remarks about the Trinity would not be worth mentioning if they had not influenced German Idealism and Romanticism so lastingly. For Lessing, creation as the act of the triune God was of the same metaphysical necessity as the generation of the Logos. The Trinity itself was for him just an extrapolation of human consciousness into the absolute. He also asserted the impossibility of identifying the historical Jesus with the second person of the Trinity. By bringing history to the table of Trinitarian discussions, Semler and Lessing paved the way for Hegel (Nisbet: 1999). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pietism evolved in Reformed and Lutheran areas, heavily influenced by Jacob Philip Spener (1633–1705). The majority of pietist groups accepted the traditional orthodox doctrine of the Trinity but stressed the spiritual experience of the Trinitarian mystery while neglecting the theological explanation of it. Also, the Evangelical Revival of John Wesley (1703–91) borrowed from the pietist tradition (Vickers 2008: 69–190). As an example of the anti-intellectual pietist tradition, the Trinitarian theology of Count Zinzendorf (1700–</p>
<p class="calibre1">60) might suffice. By accepting the revelation of the Trinity through Jesus Christ, the faithful acquire a new nature that transforms every aspect of their lives due to the newly Page 10 of 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in the Early Modern Era ( <i class="calibre4">c</i></b><b class="calibre3">.1550–1770)</b> acquired access to the Trinitarian Mystery. This approach also led him to restrict his theology to the economic Trinity and to reject philosophical investigations of the Trinity. Consequently, he gave up central axioms of scholastic thought, so that he appropriated creation, redemption, and sanctification to the Divine Logos alone. For him the Trinity acts towards humans  <i class="calibre4">only</i> in and through Christ. Also problematic was his constant use of the Holy Family as analogy for the Trinity which easily conveyed a tritheistic  <b class="calibre3">(p. 250) </b>connotation (Zimmerling 2002). Thoroughly orthodox however was the Trinitarian theology of the American Congregationalist Jonathan Edwards (1703–58), which consistently applied the Augustinian mutual love analogy to the Trinity. Moreover the relational ontology he developed served as foundation for his ecclesiology (Sairsingh 1986; Studebaker 2003; Studebaker 2009). </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines the thoughts of Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Schelling about the Trinity. It describes how Kant marginalized Trinitarian doctrine and how Hegel and Schelling made use of triadic dynamisms. It explains that Hegel rejected a tri-personal divinity in favour of a self-realizing triadic dynamic symbolized by the doctrine of the Trinity while Schelling argued for divine tri-personal agency that is brought to completion in history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">WHILE it would be a gross simplification to say that the eighteenth century witnessed an eclipse of the doctrine of the Trinity, one can say with some confidence that in general the doctrine of the Trinity is fairly marginal to eighteenth-century Protestant thought. This is especially the case in its two dominant regimes, those of rational theology and of Pietism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The school of Wolff concerned itself in the main with natural theology, which consisted of rational demonstrations of the existence and nature of God with the view to establishing a minimum ratio of belief that can plausibly be extended by appeals to revelation. At least for much of the century, Pietism determined itself as a reform movement within Protestantism which concentrated on the appropriation of faith and showed little interest in doctrines, least of all doctrines that could not be traced back to the experience of regeneration. As with all generalities, this conspectus is approximate. It is possible to see even in Wolff's philosophical inspiration, Leibniz, something like an adumbration of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, in what might be called the second wave of Pietism in the second half of the century, even if the doctrine of the Trinity did not play a defining role, it was enlisted both in attempts to resist rationalism and to present a dynamic picture of history which legitimated the ideal of community and ratified moral progress. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> <b class="calibre3">Kant's Marginalization and Negative Capability </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">of German Idealism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">With Kant, however, the fact of marginalization becomes a principle. In a text such as  <i class="calibre4">Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone</i> (1793) the Trinity is an  <i class="calibre4">adiaphora</i>, that is, outside the scope of Christian faith which, in the last instance, is practical or moral. As he says in what is, arguably, his most explicit statement on this theological topic, the Trinity requires a faith about what God is in himself that ‘would be a mystery surpassing  <b class="calibre3">(p. 255)</b> all human concepts, hence unsuited to a revelation humanly comprehensible’ (Kant 1998: Bk. 3, 143). Kant here is entirely faithful to the epistemic reservations about the knowledge of God that he lays down in the first  <i class="calibre4">Critique</i>. Indeed, it would follow from his invalidating reason's ability to know the nature and existence of God that constructions of the divine as Trinity are in an even worst position. Kant's marginalization of the symbol of the Trinity in  <i class="calibre4">Religion</i> is also consistent with the practical protocols laid down in the second <i class="calibre4">Critique</i> which draw attention to the illiminable element of hope in a reality that will square the imperative of duty with happiness. But it is not simply the case that  <i class="calibre4">Religion</i> coheres with the two earlier texts. It also represents the hermeneutic turn in Kant's thought in which important questions of freedom and its relation to reason and the possibility of conversion can only be handled by means of an interpretive detour through the biblical text as focused in the narrative of original state-fall-conversion-sanctification. The interpretive detour is essentially two-sided: on the one hand, Kant pays the biblical text a significant compliment by thinking that it can play a productive philosophical role in pointing beyond inadequate construals of the self in the first two  <i class="calibre4">Critiques</i>; on the other, the biblical narrative is subjected to a rational—if practical—mode of interpretation, which is under obligation to move beyond the historical or literal sense of the biblical text. The reinscription of the ultimate authority of philosophy is important and shows that Kant's insistence on the lack of existential transparency of the symbol of the Trinity is of a piece with his earlier objections to the conjunction of dogmatism and mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, given the somewhat exigent tone of Kant's exclusion in  <i class="calibre4">Religion</i> it is worth asking the question whether there might not be provocation in excess of what is supplied by natural theology. Now while the conventional wisdom that Kant's view of Pietism is largely positive is, undoubtedly, true in fundamental respects, there are complications in Kant's relation to this more experiential form of Lutheran Protestantism, which are in significant part a function of developments within Pietism itself. The form of Pietism in the second half of the eighteenth century is significantly more theologically brazen than the earlier form of Johann Arndt and P. J. Spener who focused on the regeneration of the individual believer. A sign of this is the resurgence of the symbol of the Trinity. Pietist thinkers for whom the Trinity is important include F. C. Oetinger and A. Bengel, both of whom Kant regarded as mystagogues. In the case of the former, the symbol of the Trinity is deployed to counter the rationalism of Spinoza, which is thought to license a lifeless divine at odds with the living God of the Bible. In addition to the second wave of Pietism exhibiting a speculative form of Trinitarianism, one can also find a chiliastic apocalyptic form. If Bengel's work is only broadly Trinitarian, it connects reflection on the  <i class="calibre4">eschaton</i> with re</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> flection on the Spirit, and does so before G. E. Lessing, who arrives at a similarly eschatological and/or Joachimite form of theology in his influential essay,  <i class="calibre4">The Education of the</i> <i class="calibre4">Human Race</i> (1780), albeit by a very different route. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rise of German Idealism in Fichte and its early developments in Hegel and Schelling does not effect an immediate redress of the marginalization of the Trinity, since the anti-dogmatic principle of Idealism dictates an inhospitality to any notion that philosophy cannot license. The dogma of the Trinity is one of the easier candidates for dismissal, since it <b class="calibre3">(p. 256) </b>depends on revelation viewed as a brute fact, what will come to be known pejoratively as ‘positivity’ ( <i class="calibre4">Positivität</i>). At the same time the arrival of German Idealism, which can be dated in Fichte's  <i class="calibre4">Science of Knowledge</i> ( <i class="calibre4">Wissenschaftslehre</i>, 1794), brings to the centre of philosophy the idea of a triadic dynamic encompassing all of reality, both conscious and unconscious, both subject and object. This basic idea constitutes the horizon of German Idealism, while not dictating any particular formulation. This triadic dynamic, which begins with an absolute characterized by identity, proceeds through self-differentiation and alienation, and culminates in a produced absolute which involves both, is inflected rather differently by Schelling in his  <i class="calibre4">System of Transcendental Idealism</i> (1799) and by Hegel in his  <i class="calibre4">Differenzschrift</i> (1801). Fichte himself is no exception to this rule: if the various editions of the  <i class="calibre4">Science of Knowledge</i> themselves make a number of important alterations without compromising the specifically Fichtean emphasis of the impossibility of closure of the triadic movement, in later texts Fichte himself seems to agree with the criticisms of Schelling and Hegel for the need for closure and a measure of identity in the third and final term. In general, one can say that in the very early texts of all three Idealists triadic schematization functions independently of any attempt to appropriate the historical doctrine of the Trinity or to deal with any of its magisterial expressions. The issue among the three Idealists is how to imagine the mode of resolution which would square the demands of science set by Spinoza and the demands of history set by Lessing and Herder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, in the evolving thought of each of the German Idealists one finds evidence of a willingness to sanction an encounter between philosophical ‘speculation’ (the visionary connotations are to the fore in the very term) and the symbol of the Trinity as the summation of Christian faith. Fichte, who launched his career with a critique of the concept of revelation (1793) and who quickly found the charge of ‘atheism’ hanging over his head, in 1806 pens  <i class="calibre4">Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben</i> which articulates a  <i class="calibre4">philosophia</i> <i class="calibre4">perennis</i> which unites the Logos doctrine of John's Gospel with a Neoplatonic metaphysics of appearance. Together Johannine theology and Neoplatonic metaphysics articulate a new and improved kind of Trinitarian theology. Schelling's theological turn is at once less eccentric and more consistent. If his very late  <i class="calibre4">Philosophy of Revelation</i> (1841) is the exemplary site in which Schelling links the economy of salvation to the self-becoming of God, notices of this are provided in the famous  <i class="calibre4">Essay on Freedom</i> (1809) and  <i class="calibre4">The Ages</i> <i class="calibre4">of the World</i> (1815). Still it is not without reason that the fate of the Trinity in Protestantism in the nineteenth century is inextricably linked to G. W. F. Hegel. As is well known, unlike Fichte and Schelling, Hegel was from the very beginning a religious thinker—albeit one who like Kant and Fichte was quite critical of Christianity—who grad</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> ually evolved into being an Idealist philosopher. Nonetheless, religion was never left behind, and from the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> (1807) to the end of his life (1831), the topic of the relation of philosophy to Christianity and theology and, even more narrowly, the topic of the relation between philosophy and the symbol of the Trinity was a crucial one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Hegel borrowed considerably from Fichte and Schelling, he is singular in the consistent way in which he maps the triadic articulation of what he takes to be the absolute onto the Christian symbol of the Trinity. It is for good reason, then, that we will give Hegel pride of place. In addition, I will privilege the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> (1807) and  <i class="calibre4">Lectures</i>   <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">(p. 257) </b>on the Philosophy of Religion</i> (1821–31). I do so, however, only as I insist that as all of Hegel's discussions of the constructs and practices of Christianity are ordered towards their completion and justification in speculative philosophy, the Trinity is no exception. With respect to this Hegel's discussion of the relation between the religious and philosophical syllogisms of the  <i class="calibre4">Encyclopedia</i> (§§564–74) is in important respects exemplary. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hegel and Trinitarian Schematization</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Recent scholarly investigation of Hegel's pre- <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> period has unearthed significant clues to the effect that even as early as 1803/4 Hegel was exploring the prospects of aligning the Idealist triadic schema with the Christian symbol of the Trinity. Still, what is found there is anticipation, and it is best to begin with the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i>, and more specifically chapter 7 on Revelatory Religion (‘ <i class="calibre4">Die offenbare Religion</i>’) in which the symbol of the Trinity figures prominently. The twin foci of Hegel's treatment are the incarnation (Hegel 1977: §748–70) and a complex non-triadic narrative of salvation history, which, however, admits of being reduced to a triadic dynamic (Hegel 1977: §771–87). This synoptic dynamic gets described abstractly as the movement from Universality ( <i class="calibre4">Allgemeinheit</i>), through Particularity ( <i class="calibre4">Besonderheit</i>), to Singularity ( <i class="calibre4">Einzelheit</i>). This language continues to be used throughout Hegel's career, and receives full-blown philosophical justification in the  <i class="calibre4">Encyclopedia</i>. But it is obvious in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i>, as it will be the case later in  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i> and the  <i class="calibre4">Encyclopedia</i>, that the triadic dynamic is linked to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity in two different ways: the realm of Universality seems to be associated with what in the classical theological tradition is the Trinity  <i class="calibre4">in se</i>. Hegel admits a triadically shaped divine as the non-temporal ground of the economy (Hegel 1977: §§771). It is essentially on the basis of what is at least a facsimile of the immanent Trinity that the activities of creation, redemption (Hegel 1977: §§774–</p>
<p class="calibre1">85), and sanctification (Hegel 1977: §§786–7) are associated with the agency of the Son and the Spirit respectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There can be no doubt that Hegel makes the symbol or ‘representation’ ( <i class="calibre4">Vorstellung</i>) of the Trinity central once again for Protestant Christianity by regarding it as nothing less than the symbol of symbols. Thought rightly the symbol of the Trinity is not a dogmatic abstraction; rather it is the perfect symbol for a dynamic, self-differentiating divine who necessarily becomes in and through history. On the philosophical front the symbol cor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> rects for various forms of monism; on the theological front it legitimates Christianity over other religions which are unable to synthesize unity and plurality, stasis and becoming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More specifically it validates Christianity over other monotheistic faiths, and in doing so determines them to be unphilosophical, that is, not capable of being assimilated by and justified within a self-authenticating conceptual network. It is also clear that the symbol of the Trinity serves a major role in the legitimation of modernity. When its eschatological thrust is correctly taken into account, Hegel is persuaded that the symbol of the Trinity offers a way to value appropriately the human community which, precisely  <b class="calibre3">(p. 258) </b>as the moment of human actualization, is the moment of the divine self-realization. Here an essentially Joachimite perspective has been enlisted in a speculative program of divine becoming that would have been foreign to the still very medieval Joachim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given Hegel's agenda in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> to trace those historical expressions of Spirit that have been constitutive of human (and now divine) self-realization, one would not expect Hegel to appeal to the creedal tradition. It is sufficient for him to show quite generally that in its symbol of the Trinity Christianity anticipates the fully self-validating truth of speculative philosophy. Still there are marks of fairly deliberate separation between his view and that of the mainline theological traditions. For example, Hegel makes it plain that he has no time for a tri-personal divine, which he deems to reduce to tritheism. Accordingly, he advocates thinking of the divine ‘before’ economic activity as consisting of three moments rather than three mutually relating entities (Hegel 1977: §771). In addition, as he comes to connect the Son not only with incarnation and redemption but also with creation, by confounding Lucifer (Son of Light) and Christ (Hegel 1977: §776), he shows his dependence on the texts of the heterodox Lutheran mystic, Jacob Boehme (1575–1624). The recall is, however, fully substantive and not simply lexical: as in Boehme there seems to be an intrinsic connection between creation and evil considered as a productive contradiction essential to the Trinitarian divine being really real. Although Hegel may very well have understood himself to be articulating a Trinitarian scheme in light of Luther's theology of the cross, and may even have in mind Luther's <i class="calibre4">Small Catechism</i>, which speaks to different roles of Father, Son, and Spirit, it is obvious that it is not Luther's own position, but that of Boehme which gets elaborated. For in the Lutheran tradition, it is Boehme who also felt it necessary to deny that the immanent Trinity consists of three persons and affirm that it consists of a triadic dynamic, which, however, fully realizes itself only in and through divine activity in the world or, put better, in divine activity  <i class="calibre4">as</i> world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Hegel's departures from the Lutheran tradition do not seem to worry him very much, despite repeated avowal of his Lutheranism, his departures from the mainline theological tradition would have worried him even less. Still, these departures are worth mentioning, especially in light of contemporary appropriations of Hegelian Trinitarian thought, which are anxious to claim theological validity for these departures. Here I will give no more than an inventory of the most obvious departures in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i>. If we consider, for example, Augustine's  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> and/or Aquinas’  <i class="calibre4">Summa theologiae</i> part 1, questions Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> 27–43 as benchmarks for the classical articulation of the Trinity, it is not difficult to notice the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(i)</b> While in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> the Trinity seems to parse revelation, Hegel is insistent that the Trinity is not a mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(ii)</b> Although Hegel offers something of a facsimile of the immanent Trinity, his position differs from those of Augustine and Aquinas in at least two crucial ways. The first is, as we have already mentioned, that the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> invalidates any tri-personal view of the Trinity; the second is the eternally differentiated dynamic divine is considered neither to be self-subsistent nor fully real. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 259) (iii)</b> In the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> the classical notion of economy is also emended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Trinitarian schemes of Augustine and Aquinas, whatever the clarity or lack thereof with respect to the personal activity of the Son and the Spirit, as subjects rather than predicates of divine activity the Son and Spirit are ontologically separate from and superior to the created order. Not so in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> in which creation, as the ‘other’ to the divine, is at the same time a divine self-othering. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(iv)</b> The purpose of divine self-othering in the world of nature and finite spirit is to supply something like a theodicy in which the ultimate justification of evil and horrendous suffering in the world is that this is the only way—the ‘logical’ way—in which the divine becomes all that it can be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(v)</b> If the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> rings fundamental changes on classical construals of the immanent and economic Trinity, in consequence it rings a fundamental change on their relation. A quick comparison of the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> with  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> and the <i class="calibre4">Summa</i> confirms this. Although Hegel follows the classical pattern in formally grounding the economy in the immanent Trinity or its facsimile, it seems evident that substantively the grounding goes in the reverse direction. It is the economy—the work of the divine in the world and history—that retrospectively gives authentic reality to the immanent sphere of the divine that it otherwise would not enjoy. The immanent Trinitarian sphere requires the economy in order to be real or ‘actual’ ( <i class="calibre4">wirklich</i>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The relation between the immanent Trinity and the economy is then erotic in the strict metaphysical sense of being governed by a movement that overcomes lack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One consequence of this retrogressive dependence is that it effectively abolishes the classical immanent-economic Trinity schema, since it makes the immanent Trinity something like the first moment of a process of divine self-development from the less to the more real. This in turn leaves it open to say that in Hegel's case there is but one Trinitarian horizon, and it is only a matter of preference as to whether one calls it economic or immanent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In leading with the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> by no means do I intend to diminish the importance of Hegel's  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i>, which has rightly been thought by scholars to provide Hegel's most extensive and illuminating treatment of the symbol of the Trinity. There, Hegel is perhaps clearer than anywhere else in his oeuvre that the marginalization of the symbol leads to a disastrous misunderstanding of the very nature of Christianity as a religion of revelation (Hegel 1984: 121–3). Kant and Schleiermacher are but two of the more prominent culprits. In the 1824  <i class="calibre4">Lectures</i> Hegel has Schleiermacher's Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> <i class="calibre4">Glaubenslehre</i> (1821) very much in mind. The following is just one of the many asseverations directed against Schleiermacher's neglect of the symbol: ‘Thus it is just this definition of God by the church as a Trinity that is the concrete determination and nature of God as spirit; and spirit is an empty word if it is not grasped in this determination’ (Hegel 1984: 127; also 192). As a philosopher Hegel cannot ignore the fact that the marginalization of the symbol of the Trinity rests upon  <b class="calibre3">(p. 260) </b>methodological choices that he feels are unfounded. In other  <i class="calibre4">Lecture</i> series Hegel inveighs against Schleiermacher's appeal to the experience of ‘absolute dependence’ which is at the root of the marginalization of all doctrines (Hegel 1984: 166). For Hegel, doctrines are forms of representation (Hegel 1984: 106). In contrast to Schleiermacher he thinks that the distance from the immediacy of experience, which characterizes any and all species of representation, is a condition of the possibility of philosophy or more specifically speculative philosophy. Closely connected with the attack on the validity of immediate experience is Hegel's reservation about the authority of scripture (Hegel 1984: 157; also 168). Scripture is interpretively underdetermined, or to use Hegel's metaphoric idiom, nothing more than a ‘wax nose’ capable of being impressed with any shape (Hegel 1984: 123). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In terms of diagnosis, basic outline, and philosophical assessment, the Trinitarian articulation of  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i> corresponds fairly exactly to that of the <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i>. The same irony we saw in the case of the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> is also operative here. Despite the palpable desire to articulate a Trinitarian form that admits of philosophical justification, and despite an antipathy to the claims of scripture, Hegel assumes that his account remains within the co-ordinates of Luther or at the very least represents an authentic development. Precisely as an internal emendation of Luther, the speculative mystical thought of Jacob Boehme has significant status for Hegel in  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i>. Moreover, unlike what was the case in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i>, there is a significant measure of direct attribution. In the 1827  <i class="calibre4">Lectures</i> Boehme is mentioned as providing a template for the kind of dynamic Trinitarianism that Hegel recommends (Hegel 1985: 289). And Hegel invokes rather than merely evokes Boehme when he avails of the theosophist's symbol of Lucifer to indicate that creation as the other of the divine is as such evil (Hegel 1985: 293; also 200). As a precursor, Boehme is not only in select company, he is in strange company. The other two figures Hegel routinely mentions as providing precedents for the symbol of the Trinity are the Jewish Platonist, Philo of Alexandria, and the Gnostic Valentinus. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> While it would be fascinating to explore further the why and the wherefore of Hegel's allusions to Philo and Valentinus in  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i> as well as his actual discussion of these figures in  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the History of Philosophy</i>, it is more important to outline the ways in which Hegel departs from the mainline Trinitarian tradition, even if it is not especially his brief to be faithful to it. With a view to as much brevity as possible let it be said that the set of five subversions of classical Trinitarianism we diagnosed to be in play in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> are repeated in  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of</i> <i class="calibre4">Religion</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(i)</b> The Trinity parses revelation, but is not mysterious in the sense that it would be beyond the scope of reason; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(ii)</b> Hegel's Trinitarianism is not tri-personal; <b class="calibre3">(iii)</b> the economy of salvation is not constituted by divine action that coheres into a story, but rather by the divine as enacted in and as its non-divine other; <b class="calibre3">(p. 261) (iv)</b> the connection of the Trinity and theodicy is very much to the fore in that evil and suffering are justified in that they come to be regarded as essential features of divine becoming; and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(v)</b> against the classical position of Augustine and Aquinas Hegel insists that rightly understood the economy grounds the immanent Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Hegel goes into considerable detail on all of these points in  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i>, perhaps the areas in which the level of detail makes most difference relative to the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> are (ii), and (iv). Here also the influence of Boehme is at its most transparent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(ii) In  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i> Hegel continues to take his distance from the classical view of the immanent Trinity. Arguably, relative to the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> the polemic against the tri-personal view of the Trinity is sharpened. Hegel argues against persons as discrete entities, and diagnoses that the constitutive problem is the reifying understanding ( <i class="calibre4">Verstand</i>) which tends to freeze and fetishize (Hegel 1985: 86). Correlatively, Hegel insists that on the level of the immanent Trinity, Father, Son, and Spirit should be regarded as ‘vanishing moments’ (Hegel 1985: 194). In fact the only candidate for ascription of ‘personhood’ ( <i class="calibre4">Persönlichkeit</i>) is the third, although strictly speaking the personality of the divine requires relation to nature and history in order to be fully actualize itself. Since Hegel's discourse is not all the way down theological, the validity of categorizing its deviance from the classical articulations of the Trinity in theological terms may be open to question. Yet provided one claims no more than relative adequacy, the category of modalism naturally comes to mind. Of course, besides the usual caveat about difference in contexts between the ancient and the modern world, one would have to insist that there are three substantive differences: first, the ontological inflection of Hegel's modalism is dynamic and developmental in a way that ancient modalism is not; second, it is the third rather than the first term that enjoys ontological priority; and finally, there is a much closer relation between the economic and immanent Trinity such that the third term itself is only fully established subsequent to, and as a consequence of, the history of salvation. As suggested already, while Hegel points to any number of precedents, includ</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> ing various forms of Platonism and Neoplatonism, the credentials of the Lutheran mystic, Jacob Boehme, stand out. In texts known to Hegel Boehme not only argues that on the level of the immanent Trinity it is best not to think of persons but of a unified dynamic movement, he also suggests that the full personhood of the divine requires the other to the immanent triadic divine in order to arrive at a divine personality that transcends the virtual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(iv) The relative capaciousness of  <i class="calibre4">Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</i> vis-à-vis the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i> allows Hegel to give content to his dialectical view of the relation of the divine to nature and history which puts him in opposition to the classical tradition. Nature and finite spirit are other than God—or belong to the self-othering of God—and as such are evil. This contradicts the gratuitousness of creation that goes under the banner of  <i class="calibre4">creatio ex nihilo</i> in both Augustine and Aquinas, and transgresses the theological rule that evil can neither be attributed to God nor to his creation. An important feature of the regime of dialectic is that suffering and death is ingredient in  <b class="calibre3">(p. 262) </b>self-development of the divine subject which avails of matter, time, and history to come to itself. Hegel parses more fully his understanding of what he takes to be the suffering and the ‘death of God’, which he had somewhat more obliquely evoked in the  <i class="calibre4">Phenomenology</i>. Hegel underscores the epistemic aspect of this death, that is, modern human beings experientially and culturally interiorize the overcoming of the transcendent God of Christian worship. At the same time Hegel speaks also in a more objective register and equally emphasizes that pathos and death belong to the self-development of the divine. Contemporary theologians are surely not wrong-headed, therefore, in thinking of Hegel as representing a pivotal point in the questioning of the apathetic axiom in Augustine and Aquinas, which is developed rather than compromised in their Trinitarian thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Schelling: The Critique of Hegel; The Way Beyond Idealism</b> In my introduction I made a remark that demands qualification, and a promise that requires keeping. The two are related. The remark that demands qualification is the suggestion that because the religious interest is there from the beginning Hegel should be judged the most theologically sensitive of the German Idealists. The implication is clear: Hegel is without qualification more Trinitarian than Fichte and Schelling, and whatever his systemic deviance from the classical tradition, Hegel is closer to it by dint of his taking the symbol seriously. The promise that I have to keep is to say something about the theological commitments and subtexts of Schelling's thought after his initial transcendental Idealist phase. Obviously, it is the first of the two issues that is crucial, but we necessarily get to it by treating the post-Idealist, anti-Hegelian, Schelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the dating and the criteria for attribution continue to excite scholarly debate, it is a commonplace in studies of Schelling to mark a theological turn in his work. Sometimes the turn is traced back to the  <i class="calibre4">Essay on Human Freedom</i> (1809); at other times to the  <i class="calibre4">Ages</i> <i class="calibre4">of the World</i> (1815); at others again is the  <i class="calibre4">Philosophie der Offenbarung</i> (1841). There is Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> little or no disagreement that it is the latter collection of lectures that represents the exclamation point to a theological turn that has been ongoing for years. By the end of his career Schelling had travelled quite a distance from his Idealist beginnings in which thought moved to and from a point in which it could lay out both the conditions for thought and its objective correlative. This entire philosophical procedure is foresworn as the world and history are judged to rest on a groundless ground that does not answer to the principle of sufficient reason. As commentators on Schelling have decisively demonstrated, the influence of the mystical and esoteric traditions is more to the fore in the ‘later’ Schelling than in either Fichte or Hegel. Moreover, these traditions operate differently in Fichte and Hegel in that by comparison with Schelling's work their role is more confirmatory than productive. This is especially the case with regard to Jacob  <b class="calibre3">(p. 263) </b>Boehme, who is important for both Hegel and Schelling. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that Schelling's  <i class="calibre4">Essay on Human Freedom</i> is a paraphrase of Boehme's account of the becoming of the divine through an opposition which brings into the divine the possibility—if not the reality—of evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mixing of the specifically philosophical with the theological in the ‘later’ Schelling obviously complicates the verdict as to whether Schelling or Hegel is in the last instance more in line with the mainline Christian tradition. While there are significant differences, for example, between  <i class="calibre4">The Philosophy of Revelation</i> and Schelling's earlier post-Idealist productions, it is clear in all that in every case Schelling is engaged, on the one hand, in a philosophical mapping of revelation that takes more seriously than Hegel both its sheer gratuity and its imperviousness to exhaustive analysis, and, on the other, in an attempt to articulate a philosophical conceptuality that translates better than Hegel the Christian articulation of the Trinity. When, for example, Schelling insists that revelation is beyond reason or beyond speech ( <i class="calibre4">unvordenklich</i>) (Schelling 1977: 160, and 162), he is by no means regressing to the fideism of Jacobi, who receives a scathing press in Hegel. Reason enjoys considerable scope even as it must presuppose revelation as the given without which its conceptual articulation belongs merely to the realm of the possible. Always the philosopher of religion, revelation is not a brute fact, but rather the intuition that there is a  <i class="calibre4">prius</i> to philosophy and a remainder after philosophy has done its discursive work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While it would be going much too far to suggest that Schelling's view of the Trinity as mystery recalls exactly the apophatic riders that accompany Latin forms of Trinitarian thought as much as Greek, it is certainly true that Schelling's view achieves greater proximity to the classical Trinitarian tradition than anything found in Hegel. Schelling's considerably greater epistemic humility is connected with two other commitments that move him beyond Hegel and in greater proximity to the mainline theological tradition. First, Schelling believes that the Bible is perspicuous, although his adoption of this Lutheran axiom neither issues in the claim of the constitutive authority of the Bible nor removes the necessity for reading it in ‘a higher sense’. Second, although the higher sense is narrative, as it is in Hegel, it is symbolic rather than allegorical. It concerns the metanarrative of creation, fall, and redemption considered not as autonomous processes (Hegel), but as involving divine agency of a personal sort (Schelling 1977: 197–208). If the fall has to be laid at the door of human misuse of will, the acts of creation and redemption are Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> gratuitous acts of a personal, indeed, triune God (Schelling 1977: 194–6). If Schelling's Trinitarian thought goes beyond the economy, it is, nonetheless, true that the economy provides its  <i class="calibre4">raison d’être</i> (Schelling 1977: 197–8). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schelling's emphasis on the free acts of the divine as personal (Schelling 1977: 174–6) supports the traditional Trinitarian view of the economy that one finds in  <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> and in the  <i class="calibre4">Summa</i>. Undeniably, however, it does so with considerable tension. As anxious to avoid theological voluntarism as Hegel, Schelling underscores the intelligibility of divine self-revelation as much as possible. It is fitting, he argues, that the divine reveal itself even if it is neither logically nor ontologically required to do so: God would be somewhat less than God without the display of infinite generosity in bringing into existence an other. Schelling here seriously qualifies divine a-seity. As Schelling  <b class="calibre3">(p. 264) </b>trinitarianly specifies his thought, the qualification deepens and threatens to subvert the self-subsistence of the Trinitarian divine that he seems anxious to defend. As divine agents neither the Son nor Spirit are replete as archaeologically given. They are perfected in and through their agency in the world. It becomes unclear then, the insistence on personal agency aside, how Schelling has avoided Hegel's view of the reciprocal determination of God and the world, which, indeed, is the basic axiom of German Idealism as it was inaugurated by Fichte. Despite the move away from German Idealism, then, Schelling's Trinitarian view destabilizes the classical immanent-economic Trinity distinction which depends not only on the personhood and agency of the immanent divine, but also on its full actuality precisely as origin. ‘To destabilize’ is not, however, fully equivalent to ‘to subvert’. This distinction marks the difference between the Trinitarian view of Schelling and that of Hegel vis-à-vis the classical Trinitarian tradition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Destabilizing the relation between the immanent and economic Trinity affects the interpretation of both. Nonetheless, Schelling supports at least verbally the relative independence of the immanent Trinity and the relative dependence of the world on the triune God (Schelling 1977: 192). Within the bounds of philosophy Schelling intends to be a friend of Christianity and what for him, as for Kierkegaard, is the same thing, he intends to be an enemy of Hegel. With respect to the immanent Trinity Schelling's main argument for independence is the personhood of the divine, which is uniquely specified by the three persons (Schelling 1977: 194–6). In  <i class="calibre4">Philosophy of Revelation</i> Schelling clearly wants to avoid a repetition of the modalism that he thinks typical of pantheism (Schelling 1977: 197), of which Hegelian Trinitarian thought is the ultimate expression. Interestingly, however, Schelling's desire does not result in the embrace of the classical western formula of three persons and one essence, but rather a vision of three persons in which unity is to be secured without reference to unity of substance or essence. In any event, the main point should not be lost. Unlike what is the case in a major Catholic detractor of Hegel in the 1840s, Franz Anton Staudenmaier, Hegelian modalism finds a heterodox as well as orthodox Trinitarian answer. This fact speaks eloquently to the possibilities in twentieth-century German Trinitarian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Kant, Hegel, and Schelling</b> In insisting on the tri-personal agency Schelling in effect lumps the orthodox tradition with Hegel, whose Trinitarianism is in the last instance judged to be monistic as well as panlogical. At the very least then, on Schelling's view, the mainline Trinitarian tradition shows a much greater affinity with Sabellianism than it would like to admit. In  <i class="calibre4">Philosophy</i> <i class="calibre4">of Revelation</i> Schelling's tendency towards tritheism serves both as ground and consequent to his adoption of a subordinationist view of the Son (Schelling 1977: 259–84). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schelling adduces this position by means of an interpretation of scripture in which the pre-existence of Christ in the Pauline literature plays a prominent role. Phil. 2:6 is especially important for him (Schelling 1977: 261). He argues that the language of the ‘form of God’ implies that the Son was not equal to God the Father in every respect, but rather suggests an ‘intermediary being’. Although Phil. 2:6 bears an especially heavy burden in Schelling's anti-orthodox argument, he also produces as supporting evidence Jn 17:7 and 13:31, which are well-known passages of distinction, and recurs to the Synoptic  <b class="calibre3">(p. 265)</b> Gospels for expressions of the Son being ignorant of the hour. Schelling shows some awareness that both in its basic form and exegetical practice his position is redolent of Arianism by volubly denying it. His view, he maintains, differs  <i class="calibre4">toto coelo</i> from Arianism because his position contravenes the Arian axiom that the Son is created (Schelling 1977: 273–4). While strictly speaking this is correct, it is not clear that his position differs from semi-Arianism, which does not involve a commitment to the createdness of the Son. The homology with semi-Arianism becomes apparent in his interpretation of the Prologue to the Gospel of John (Schelling 1977: 271–2), often thought to be the textual bastion of the orthodox party. He argues in  <i class="calibre4">Philosophy of Revelation</i> that the Prologue supports the view that the  <i class="calibre4">Son</i> pre-exists the world and is  <i class="calibre4">with</i> the Father but does not prove that the Son is generated by the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As with Hegel, the ‘later’ Schelling thinks that a Trinitarian divine is a requirement for a </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘speculative’ mode of thought which has no intention of obeying Kant's epistemological strictures concerning God-talk. It is equally clear, however, that despite his much greater knowledge of the Trinitarian tradition Schelling has no more interest in underwriting the traditional view of the Trinity and the relation between the immanent and economic Trinity than Hegel. He considers himself to offer an alternative to the traditional theological view while also proposing an alternative to Hegel's alternative. As we have indicated above, his philosophical construction of the Trinity heads in a tritheistic and subordinationist direction quite different from Hegel's more or less Sabellian orientation. None of this should disguise, however, how much Schelling has in common with Hegel in terms of an elaboration of dynamic ontology in which actuality ( <i class="calibre4">Wirklichkeit</i>) of the Trinity is a function of ‘theogonic process’ (Schelling 1977: 197–8) and the similar ways in which the action of the divine subject or subjects in history are constitutive of their identity. Like Hegel, Schelling also recalls Joachim's Trinitarian schematization of the ‘ages’ of the world under the spotlight of the future which is the lure of all movement and differentiation (Schelling 1977: 315). One can rightly conclude that for all his interest in going beyond Hegel in general, and his Trinitarian construction of reality in particular, Schelling corrects and emends Hegel's scheme, rather than break with it altogether. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This article aims to illustrate the prominent features of Trinitarian theology in nineteenth-century Protestant thought, focusing on developments in Germany. It shows that Friedrich Schleiermacher had a major impact through his view that traditional Trinitarian doctrine is abstracted from the experience of salvation. This impact was reflected in Isaac Dorner's effort to develop a Trinitarian theology on the basis of analysis of the ethical or supreme god and in Johann von Hofmann's emphasis on the history of salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Trinitarian theology, Protestant thought, Germany, Friedrich Schleiermacher, salvation, Isaac Dorner, supreme god, Johann von Hofmann</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THERE is a well-known narrative about nineteenth-century theology: the doctrine suffered a grievous blow at the hands of the rationalistic theologians of the Enlightenment, that Friedrich Schleiermacher provided the  <i class="calibre4">coup de grâce</i>, that the doctrine consequently lay moribund throughout the nineteenth century, and that its vitality today is due only to the efforts of Karl Barth and those who followed his lead. As with all narratives made familiar by retelling, there is a pith of truth here. Enlightenment theologians had little regard for the doctrine; Schleiermacher harboured grave doubts about the traditional form of the doctrine. And Karl Barth did in fact stir up enthusiasm for the doctrine with his powerful advocacy. But the simplicity of the narrative warns us against its plausibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schleiermacher's view of the Trinity resists easy summarizing and, far from being moribund, the doctrine was vigorously discussed and employed throughout the nineteenth century by Protestant theologians of all types. The Barthian renewal of Trinitarian theology, accordingly, was no recovery after a period of neglect; it was instead the continuation of a dialogue underway for more than a century before the appearance of  <i class="calibre4">Church Dogmatics</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the prominent features of Trinitarian theology in nineteenth-century Protestant thought. The treatment is necessarily brief and adumbrative; I will not rehearse the thoughts of the many Lutheran and Reformed theologians who dutifully transmitted the doctrine in its traditional form without substantial change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead I will focus on the ways in which the debates of the nineteenth century shaped Trinitarian discussion. That means that I will be focusing on the innovative ways in which the doctrine was understood; however it is important to remember that for  <b class="calibre3">(p. 268) </b>many Protestant theologians the important thing was preservation, not innovation. I will also focus on developments in Germany, since this was the principal ground from which the twentieth-century discussion has sprung. This focus does not, of course, imply that important thinking about the Trinity took place only in Germany. On the contrary, there were highly significant currents of thought in Britain, America, and elsewhere; however, few of them proved to be as influential on later theology as developments in Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A Brief Look at the Eighteenth-Century Background</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Discussion about the Trinity in the nineteenth century was conducted in the shocked aftermath of the eighteenth century's discussion among Enlightenment theologians, which was, to put it mildly, often dismissive of Trinitarian theology (Powell 2001: 60–103). Responding to the traditional claim that the doctrine was a mystery surpassing human reason, available only by piecing together relevant Scriptural passages, many eighteenth-century theologians found the doctrine to be an incredulous mixture of misinterpreted Scripture and philosophical confusion. Their way had been prepared by Socinian theologians, who discerned no Biblical teaching about eternal distinctions in the divine nature and thus found the orthodox doctrine lacking in scriptural support. Biblicists in their own way, many eighteenth-century theologians agreed with Socinian exegesis and argued for a purging of the doctrine on the basis that it failed the Reformers’ demand that the Church's teaching have unmistakable and substantial biblical warrants. To this argument Immanuel Kant added that the doctrine of the Trinity served no practical spiritual purpose. Kant was puzzled by the notion that an abstract and suspicious theory about the divine being could have a serious role to play in the religious life. Finding no such role, he dismissed the doctrine as idle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the eighteenth century had its share of orthodox theologians who saw neither exegetical nor logical problems with the doctrine and vigorously resisted the assaults of the Enlightenment. But the debate had clearly identified some weak spots in the doctrine and laid the foundation for even more serious troubles in the nineteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> <b class="calibre3">Some General Features of Nineteenth-Century </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Theology</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth delivered to theology several powerful if controversial stimuli to the doctrine of God. These stimuli appeared in the philosophies of German Idealists such as Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Schelling, and G. W. F. Hegel (Powell 2001: 104–41). These thinkers fashioned a  <b class="calibre3">(p. 269) </b>new landscape for the doctrine of God and introduced a set of questions and concerns that previous generations had not considered. Following the lead of these philosophers, we find nineteenth-century theologians asking hitherto unraised questions about God's self-consciousness and actuality. Does God become? If so, does God become actual through a relation with the cosmos? Is God free? Is the cosmos an element of God's being? Is God's knowledge of the cosmos an act of self-consciousness? In what sense is God personal? Does personality imply finitude? All of these questions were either new in theological history or were asked in new ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel not only posed these questions but also provided philosophical answers with expressly Trinitarian features, although many disputed the Christian character of these answers. Nonetheless, their philosophical appropriation of the Trinity freed nineteenth-century theology from the exegetical preoccupations of eighteenth-century theology and bequeathed an approach to the Trinity that portrayed it as the solution to a set of characteristically nineteenth-century problems. All that remained was for theologians to bring this philosophical discourse into dialogue with the concerns of Protestant theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, although many theologians were happy that the philosophical tsunami of Idealism had swept away some of the difficulties of the eighteenth-century, Idealist philosophy was not the only force with which theology had to contend. Eighteenth-century thought had also introduced the historicist legacy into theological studies. Consequently, many theologians found that the Bible could no longer be read, as it had been before the Enlightenment, as a relatively straightforward source of doctrines. The task for nineteenth-century theologians was to assimilate the consequences of idealist philosophy while doing justice to the increasingly historicist approach to the Bible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Friedrich Schleiermacher</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich Schleiermacher's (1768–1834) response to eighteenth-century rationalistic theology was, in retrospect, as simple as it was profound and innovative (Powell 2001: 87–</p>
<p class="calibre1">103; Schleiermacher 1999). Confessional, orthodox theologians sought to rebut Enlightenment historical critique of Bible and creeds by buttressing the authority of Scripture and the idea of inspiration. Schleiermacher saw that this approach was doomed. In its place he offered a theory, not of divine inspiration but of human language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> Language, he argued, is one of several ways in which humans communicate the subjective world of feelings, desires, and thoughts. It is language that enables human community to exist, for community is a matter of communication. As human culture develops, language becomes more technical in the sense of being capable of expressing increasingly precise concepts. In the modern world, this technical quality rises to the level of scientific discourse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With this analysis of language, Schleiermacher turned to the Christian community and its language. Religion, according to Schleiermacher, is a special sort of feeling  <b class="calibre3">(p. 270)</b> ( <i class="calibre4">Gefühl</i>), a pre-reflective awareness of the unity of all things and the divine ground of that unity. Christianity is grounded in an important modification of that feeling; Christianity is based, not on the feeling of unity abstractly considered, but on the dependence of spiritual life on the redemption accomplished by Jesus Christ. This dependence is, like other feelings, a subjective phenomenon—it is the effect of redemption on the inner life of believers as that redemption was conveyed by early Christian teaching and preaching. So, like other feelings it can be communicated in various ways, including language. At first, the religious language of the Christian community was deeply poetic and homiletical. This is the language of the Bible. Eventually, the Christian community and its language developed until the sense of dependence expressed poetically and informally in the Bible came to be expressed more exactly in the language of creeds and dogmatic theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schleiermacher's point was that Christian doctrines are the products of a particular society—the Church—and are conceptually precise, verbal formulations of the basic impact that Jesus made on the first disciples as that has been transmitted through the generations as the Church preaches, teaches, and provides living examples. The creeds thus contain the same content as the Bible; they differ from the Bible only in mode of expression. Both Bible and creeds are verbal expressions of the impact (in the form of feeling) of Jesus on believers. Consequently, neither creeds nor Bible constitute an infallible, miraculous book of divine revelation. And although they function as norms of faith, they are secondary to the redemption accomplished by Jesus and experienced as feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Armed with this theory of doctrine and language, Schleiermacher tackled the doctrine of the Trinity in his main work of theology,  <i class="calibre4">The Christian Faith</i>. Two preliminary remarks are appropriate. First, to the puzzlement of many later commentators, he placed the doctrine at the end of his system, misleadingly suggesting that the doctrine is a mere appendix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, his treatment of the doctrine in this work was, by his own admission, incomplete and unsatisfying. Schleiermacher went on record with his belief that the time was not yet right for an adequate treatment of this doctrine. All he could do, he claimed, was to help lay some groundwork for future labour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding the first point: Schleiermacher placed the Trinity last in his system, not because it forms an appendix ( <i class="calibre4">ein Anhang</i>) but instead because it forms the keystone ( <i class="calibre4">Schlußstein</i>) of Christian doctrine. As a keystone, the Trinity is critically important to understanding his system. This point becomes clear when we see that his  <i class="calibre4">Christian Faith</i> is organized in such a way that theological abstractions about God are presented in the early Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> pages and gradually give way to the concrete knowledge of God. The penultimate concepts for God are wisdom and love, for these attributes are most concretely related to the redemption accomplished by Jesus. The doctrine of the Trinity, then, when fully articulated, would express the most concrete knowledge of God. As Schleiermacher explained, the Trinity has to come last because it depends on the historical appearance of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The doctrine of the Trinity is the keystone of Christian doctrine because it draws all the other doctrines together and explains their basis in God's union with the world. This interpretation of Schleiermacher's  <i class="calibre4">Christian Faith</i>  <b class="calibre3">(p. 271) </b>explains why his system has no express doctrine of God. The whole of the  <i class="calibre4">Christian Faith</i> is the doctrine of God, proceeding from abstractions to concrete knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding the second point: Schleiermacher acknowledged, in the  <i class="calibre4">Christian Faith</i>, that his treatment of the Trinity was unfinished. What he offered, in fact, was largely a critique of the traditional doctrine with a few hints of the direction an adequate doctrine would take. Honesty, of course, is no excuse. If the Trinity is truly the keystone of Christian doctrine, then he was obliged to offer something better than he did. But it may be instructive to explore why Schleiermacher felt that the time was not right for a more adequate presentation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schleiermacher believed that the traditional doctrine said too much—that it contained statements about God that bore no relation to the ground of doctrine, the sense of spiritual dependence on Jesus Christ. There is, he asserted, nothing in the actual experience of believers that requires belief that God exists as three eternally distinct persons. Schleiermacher himself was sceptical about the idea of eternal distinctions; he conceived of God as a unity without difference. Nonetheless, his main point was the lack of connection between the nature of redemption and the idea of eternal distinction. It irked him that the Church had sanctioned a doctrine that contained, he felt, a substantial core of speculation unrelated to lived experience. Accordingly, he argued, before he could offer a reformulation of this doctrine, it was necessary to show the inadequacies of the traditional doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schleiermacher did not reject every aspect of the traditional doctrine. He believed that it contained an important truth that must be retained in any reformulation of the doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That truth is that God united with human nature to form the person of Jesus Christ and that the Holy Spirit is likewise the union of the divine being with human nature. More exactly: in the incarnation, the divine being (which, Schleiermacher insisted, should be thought of as an activity) was united with human nature in a person-forming activity. The result of this activity was Jesus Christ. Thereafter, the divine being was united with human nature a second time; however, in this case the union was not person-forming but community-forming. The result was the Church and its common spirit, the Holy Spirit. It was, he held, these uniting-activities that were directly experienced in the Christian life and expressed in the New Testament and creedal affirmations about Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. This was, he argued, the truth of the doctrine of the Trinity and the basis of a future adequate treatment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> For Schleiermacher, then, the doctrine of the Trinity is not about eternal, personal distinctions in God. It is instead about the way in which, in history, the divine being unites with human nature. Far from being a speculative doctrine about eternity, it is a collection of statements about God's redemptive activity in history and is the immediate consequence of the lived experience of redemption. As such, it has to come last in the system of doctrine, because it presupposes Christology, pneumatology, and soteriology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The distinctive features of Schleiermacher's doctrine of God—God as a unity without difference, the divine being as pure activity, the process by which God  <i class="calibre4">becomes</i> a Trinity by successive unions with human nature—failed to gain much following in the nineteenth-century, even among those who were otherwise avid supporters. At the same time, he did <b class="calibre3">(p. 272) </b>impress on subsequent theologians the importance of tying the doctrine rather directly to the experienced facts of redemption and the suspicion that the traditional doctrine fell short in this respect. Consequently, although his own programme for reformulating the doctrine was a failure, his larger programme of rethinking the nature of Christian doctrine was monumentally influential. Except for the confessional orthodox theologians, all subsequent Protestant presentations of the Trinity in the nineteenth century exhibited a commitment to Schleiermacher's insight that every authentic doctrine is rooted in the Christian experience of God's redemptive activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hegelian Theologians: Philip Marheineke</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As noted previously, Schleiermacher was not the only influence on later nineteenth-century Protestant theology. Friedrich Schelling and G. W. F. Hegel were also highly influential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly every theologian was influenced to some extent by these thinkers; some, however, intentionally developed theologies that reflected their thought with great sympathy and faithfulness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the theologians most closely identified with Schelling and Hegel was Philip Marheineke (1780–1846). His main dogmatic work,  <i class="calibre4">Die Grundlehren der christlichen</i> <i class="calibre4">Dogmatik als Wissenschaft</i> (Marheineke 1827), went through several editions that reflected the change in his thinking from a primary commitment to Schelling to a primary commitment to Hegel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Marheineke, as for Hegel and Schelling, the ecclesiastical doctrine of the Trinity is a description of God that, using familiar and concrete language, expresses the same truth about God that speculative philosophy discovers as it reflects on the structure of thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Philosophy and Christian theology are thus about the same truth; however, they express that truth in very different ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marheineke's main categories for understanding God are being, thought, identity, and difference. Being and thought are together the constituents of the divine essence, since God cannot be thought of as merely substantial being or the activity of thinking. Instead, God is being which is thought, and thinking which subsists. Identity and difference are ways in which we can conceive the divine essence. In Judaism and other religions, God is consid</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> ered to be merely an identity, a substantial being. Christianity recognizes, of course, God's identity (in its doctrine of the unity of the divine being); however, it also recognizes difference within God, but a difference that does not compromise the identity. We can see in Marheineke's conceptual apparatus the fundamentals of idealist philosophy—a concern that God's identity be conceived dynamically and not statically, and a concern that God be conceived as the activity of thought as well as being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marheineke's approach to the doctrine of the Trinity was to see in the terms Father, Son, and Spirit references to the nature of God as articulated by the Idealists. ‘Father’ thus refers to God thought of as substantial being and as self-caused. This is the way in which God is typically portrayed in theistic proofs: the first cause and the original being  <b class="calibre3">(p. 273)</b> possessing a-seity. Moreover, in this aspect God is depicted as a being who is distinct from the world and independent of the world's existence. The idea of the eternal Son adds to this picture of God by portraying God as rational—as  <i class="calibre4">logos</i>. Marheineke thus saw the ideas of Father and Son as the Church's way of stating the truth that God is both being and thought, substance and subject. At the same time, the ‘Son’ is the principle of otherness and difference within God. Whereas ‘Father’ designates God as a pure identity without difference, ‘Son’ designates God as the dyad of identity and difference, as substantial being standing over against thought and subjectivity in otherness. However, the ecclesiastical doctrine does not leave Father and Son in their difference; it asserts that the Son proceeds from the Father and that the Son is of the Father's being. For Marheineke, this signifies that, for all the difference between being and thought, there is an underlying identity of the two. The Son is, in fact, the divine essence in the mode of otherness and difference, whereas the Father is the divine essence in the mode of identity and substantial being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What about the Spirit? In the Augustinian version of the Trinity (which exercised a profound influence on the western theological and philosophical tradition), the Holy Spirit is the bond of unity between Father and Son, the love that subsists between Father and Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Idealists such as Marheineke felt that this Augustinian insight expressed just the point that they wanted to make: that God is the unity of substance and subject, the identity of identity and difference. To say that God is Spirit is to say that God is not simply the opposition of being and thought, substance and subject, but to affirm as well that this opposition subsists within an encompassing identity. If the divine were only Father, God would not be self-conscious subjectivity, since self-consciousness presupposes difference. Instead God would be the universal substance of all, as conceived in pantheistic systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God could not be only the Son, for as the principle of difference the idea of the Son presupposes the identity and substance expressed by the Father. God as Spirit is thus neither mere pantheistic substance nor simply self-consciousness lacking substance. Spirit is neither merely Father nor Son, but the identity-in-difference of both, the identity of identity and difference. In this way, Marheineke believed, idealist philosophy and the theology it inspired were rendering the truth of theological doctrine in a philosophically rigorous form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> It is important to note that Spirit is more than an aspect of deity; it bears an essential relation to religion. This is because God is not a being that exists in opposition to the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the contrary, the world is an element in God's actualization. So, just as (in the doctrine of the Trinity) the Spirit is the unity and relation of Father and Son, so the Spirit is the unity and relation of the divine essence with the world. This unity and relation become concrete in religious and philosophical knowledge. Although the Son is the eternal principle of revelation, this is not actual revelation; it pertains to God's potential to be known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God becomes actually revealed (that is, known) in and through religion and, in a more adequate way, in philosophy. Religious and philosophical knowledge is the revelation of God and is the actualization of Spirit in human thought. In other words, this knowledge of God is the world's union with God. Here Marheineke most clearly revealed his Hegelian commitments: the Trinitarian movement from Father to Son to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 274) </b>Spirit describes the movement of God from being to actual Spirit. But this movement is not confined within the divine essence. On the contrary, God as Spirit passes over into the world in the form of human knowledge of God, first in religion and then in speculative philosophy. To say that God is Spirit is to affirm that God is an identity-with-difference that embraces the world and to affirm that Spirit becomes actual when human beings come to know God in religion and, more profoundly, in philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Mediating Theologians: Isaac August Dorner</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The period between Schleiermacher and the rise of Albrecht Ritschl's school saw the development of a style of Protestant theology that was doctrinally conservative but that owed a great debt to Schleiermacher and to idealist philosophy. Isaac August Dorner (1809–84) was an outstanding representative of this development (Dorner 1888–91; Dorner 1872–82). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although agreeing with Schleiermacher that doctrines are ultimately grounded in religious consciousness, Dorner actually began with the concrete form of consciousness, faith, especially as verbalized in the Bible and tradition. Faith, he argued, contains an inner impulse to know the truth of what it affirms. Consequently, he agreed with Schleiermacher that doctrines such as the Trinity are not metaphysical in nature or rooted in speculation, but are instead soteriological, rooted in faith's struggle to understand and to attain certainty of its truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The point of departure for understanding the doctrine of the Trinity is the idea of ‘the ethical’, that is, the supreme good. The ethical, he argued in agreement with Kant, is a necessary object of the human mind, since human thought necessarily postulates an ultimate end. God is this supreme ethical reality. But this affirmation raises important questions: is God good strictly by the necessity of the divine nature? Or does God also, in freedom, will to be good? If the former, then God is good of necessity and without self-determination (a sort of platonic form without freedom). But this cannot be God; the ethical cannot be merely a substance. The ethical must also be an object of will and chosen for itself. However, if the ethical is merely the object of volition and of free choice—if it is not substan</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> tially and intrinsically good—then it is arbitrary. The ethical, God, must therefore be a perfect unity of freedom and necessity. It must be intrinsically good but also be self-conscious and in freedom affirm its own goodness. As the unity of freedom and necessity, God must encompass difference. The unity and difference of the divine being, Dorner concluded, is the content of the doctrine of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Father points to the moment of necessity in God, in which God is conceived as substantially good. Yet there is a second moment, which is (in ontological terms) not the moment of divine being but the moment of divine willing. Because of this second moment, we think of God not only as the good by nature, but additionally as <b class="calibre3">(p. 275) </b>willing to be the good. In freedom God affirms God's own self as the ethical, and this second mode of being, the principle of freedom, is designated in the doctrine of the Son. On this second mode of being depends everything that is associated with freedom, including love and personality. This second mode is not independent of the first, but is instead grounded in the first, for just as necessity logically precedes freedom, so the Father generates the Son. And, just as in the Augustinian tradition the Spirit is the principle of unity between Father and Son, so in Dorner's theology the Spirit is the unity of divine freedom and necessity. Because God is Spirit and not simply Father and Son, there is no opposition between freedom and necessity. God freely affirms and wills to be what God is by nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dorner's theology testifies to the influence of Idealist philosophy and converged with Hegel's philosophy at some points. Like Hegel he viewed God as a harmony of opposites, a unity that embraces difference; he grounded the second Trinitarian moment (the Son) logically in the first (the Father); he saw the inadequacy of thinking of God simply as substance; and he regarded the Spirit as the ideal unity of the first two moments. At the same time, Dorner did not hesitate to disagree with the Idealist elevation of philosophical conceptuality above religious faith. For Dorner, the doctrine of the Trinity fulfils faith's need to achieve truth and coherence; only this doctrine makes sense of the concept of the ethical. Only this doctrine resolves the potential contradiction between necessity and freedom. As rationally satisfying a demand of the intellect, this doctrine is a ‘scientific’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrine. But whereas for Marheineke and other Hegelians the Trinity is a scientific doctrine because it can be conceptually reproduced by speculative thinking, it is scientific for Dorner because it is the coherent solution to a concrete intellectual problem posed by faith. Scientific verification of the Christian idea of God comes about when this problem is solved in the doctrine of the Trinity. Philosophy thus does not represent, for Dorner, a higher stage of cognition than faith. It should also be added that in one important respect Dorner's method owes more to Kant than to Hegel: for Dorner the truth about God is attained not through the reflexive nature of self-consciousness, but through seeking the necessary presuppositions of moral-religious experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> <b class="calibre3">The Erlangen School of Lutheran Theology: Johann von Hofmann</b> Another variety of nineteenth-century Protestant theology was found in the renewal of Lutheran theology. Some representatives were interested only in returning to the methods and interests of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century theology; others, however, took seriously the alteration of the intellectual landscape resulting from Schleiermacher's theology and idealist philosophy. Johann Christian Konrad von Hofmann (1810–77) is the leading representative of the latter theologians (Hofmann 1841–4; Hofmann 1857–60). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Hofmann, the key to understanding the doctrine of the Trinity is not particular biblical texts but instead the Christian concept of history. Scripture, he believed, refers <b class="calibre3">(p. 276) </b>directly to the acts and revelation of God within history. Only indirectly does it describe the eternal being of God. It does not, therefore, provide information about the eternal Trinity. In speaking of Father, Son, and Spirit, the Biblical writers were depicting relations within God in so far as God had acted within history. Theological knowledge, accordingly, begins with revelation in history and infers from it the necessary presuppositions of that revelation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The place to begin, then, is with Hofmann's understanding of history. (Hofmann's theology of history encompasses the entire created world, so that the beginning of creation is also the beginning of history.) History is no mere aggregate of events, but a unified whole with a beginning and end. The beginning was not simply an origin. On the contrary, history's beginning was God's decision to establish fellowship with humankind. The beginning thus implies a teleological end—the full actualization of this fellowship. Corresponding to history's beginning and end is Jesus Christ. Jesus is the person in whom this fellowship was actualized and, therefore, is history's  <i class="calibre4">telos</i>. But he is just as much the archetype of humanity, for he represents humankind in perfect relation to God. History, in other words, is thoroughly Christological. So, the history of the world is, theologically considered, the realization of God's will to fellowship with humankind and, Christologically considered, the person of Jesus. It is, in a word (which Hofmann apparently coined or at least popularized), the history of salvation ( <i class="calibre4">Heilsgeschichte</i>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The theological and Christological nature of history has implications for our understanding of God. Somewhat abstractly, we can affirm that history has a Trinitarian ground: God the creator, God the primordial image, and God the ground of life. However, more concrete affirmations are possible. In creating the world and its history, God had resolved to bring history to its realization by entering into that history. God's relation to history is therefore not simply the relation of creator to creation. Instead, God had in a way joined the divine being to the historical process. Through this union with history, the creator becomes the Father of Jesus Christ; the primordial image becomes Jesus Christ; and the ground of life becomes the Spirit of Jesus and his Father. God thus becomes, in and through world history, more concrete, so to speak, as the relation between Jesus and the Father, transpiring in the Spirit, brings the divine will to fellowship to perfection. Hof</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a><b class="calibre3">Nineteenth-Century Protestant Doctrines of the Trinity</b> mann was affirming that God has become Trinitarian (in the express sense of Father, Son, and Spirit) in order to create a historical world whose culmination would be the actualization of a relationship with humankind. In eternity, God determined to become Father, Son, and Spirit for the sake of this history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this determination was in a sense costly for God—it disrupted the ideal unity and harmony of God's eternal being. The primordial image, in fully entering history and becoming Jesus Christ, divested itself of its divine attributes in an act of  <i class="calibre4">kenosis</i>. There was thus established an inequality within God; the Son had become something different from the Father. Of course, Hofmann maintained that a fundamental equality of the persons endures as the background of this historical inequality. Nonetheless, by identifying with history in the person of Jesus, the primordial image experienced a change of status that qualified its divinity. This is Hofmann's version of the Idealist intuition that God is an identity-amid-difference. For Hofmann, the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 277) </b>difference arose from the disparity between the image-become-human and the divine nature of the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History is thus enclosed within the Trinitarian life of God; the Trinity's self-translation into history is the precondition for all becoming, for the act of creation was not simply the creation of a world but was also the creation of a world destined for fellowship with God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinity's self-translation into history means that the Trinity is no static reality. The decision to create and to culminate history in Jesus constitutes God as Father, Son, and Spirit. Of course, because of the limitations of revelation, we cannot know what the Trinity was before the creation of the world, beyond such abstractions as creator, primordial image, and ground of life. We can, however, affirm that with the incarnation there is a signification modification in God. Although not (in Idealist fashion) by necessity, God passes over into otherness and disparity through the historical process and leads history to its divine telos. </p>
