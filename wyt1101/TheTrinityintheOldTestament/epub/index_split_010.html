<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 524) </b>However, the male parent is not the closest human likeness to the divine Father, whose begetting can be seen to differ from both the masculine and feminine modes of human generation in many ways while being like each of them in certain respects. Divine generation is unlike human fatherhood in that the Father does not implant his seed into another being in order to produce an offspring. It is unlike human motherhood in that he does not receive seed from another. As Athanasius says, ‘Nothing flows out from the immaterial’, that is the Father's divine nature, ‘nor does anything flow into him, as with humans’ ( <i class="calibre4">On the Decree of the Nicene Council</i> 11, in Opitz 1934: 2.1.10). Yet like a human father, he is the source of the Son's life, and like a human mother he brings forth the Son from within himself. The Son's divine being comes entirely from him, without the collaboration of another parent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is evident that the closest human analogue to this mode of generation is actually the virginal birth-giving of the Theotokos. She brings forth the same Son in time, and his human nature comes entirely from her, without any contribution from a human father. In God the Father and in the Virgin Mother, each of whom brings forth the offspring alone, there is a wholeness, purity, and integrity of parenthood. The patristic concept of virginity includes these characteristics of wholeness, purity, and integrity along with absence of sexual involvement. The fruit of such a mode of parenthood is also wholeness, the absolute completeness and perfection of Christ's two natures, divine and human, which originate in these two virginal generations (Gregory of Nazianzus,  <i class="calibre4">Poem</i> 1.2.1, PG 37: 523–4; and Gregory of Nyssa,  <i class="calibre4">On Virginity</i> 2,  <i class="calibre4">GNO</i> 8: 1.253). In several places Gregory of Nazianzus says that the Son is generated in eternity without a mother and in time without a father ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.19, SC 250: 218;  <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 38.2, SC 358: 106;  <i class="calibre4">Poem</i> 1.1.9, PG 37: 459–62). He explains further that the generation of other human children involves division and incompleteness since they are the offspring of a pair, whereas Christ as human comes entirely from the Virgin, and as divine he comes entirely from the Father ( <i class="calibre4">Oration</i> 29.4–5, SC 250: 184). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the fifth century, this parallel between the Father and the Virgin officially entered the Church's dogma through its inclusion in the Chalcedonian Definition. In classical and patristic Greek, the same words, cemm›y and cœmmgsir, name the engendering of an off</p>

<p class="calibre1">spring by either a male or a female parent (Liddell and Scott 1968: s.v; Lampe 1961: s.v.), so that in English they are often translated begetting when a father is the subject and bearing or giving birth in the case of a mother. We have seen that gender was not at issue in the standard patristic concept of divine generation. Accordingly, the Fathers of Chalcedon used a single verb to name both the divine and human generations of our Lord Jesus Christ. The definition says that he is ‘generated (cemmghœmta = begotten or born?) before the ages from the Father in his divinity and in the last days … of Mary the Virgin Theotokos in his humanity’ (Pelikan and Hotchkiss 2003: 180). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interestingly, the idea that the divine generation transcends gender was expressed explicitly by a local western council held at Toledo in 675, which issued the following statement: ‘For neither from nothing, nor from any other substance, but from the womb of the Father ( <i class="calibre4">de Patris utero</i>), that is, from his substance, we must believe that the Son was begotten or born ( <i class="calibre4">genitus vel natus</i>)’ (Pelikan and Hotchkiss 2003: 716; see  <b class="calibre3">(p. 525)</b> Moltmann 1981; Soskice 1992). Although the feminine image of the womb is central to this passage, it goes on to name the Son's generation in language appropriate to both male and female parents. This means that God's fatherhood is a unique mode of generation characterized by a wholeness that includes as well as transcending aspects of both forms of human parenthood. This conciliar text is not authoritative in the Orthodox Church, but it illustrates graphically how the language of motherhood comes closest in human terms to conveying an important aspect of what occurs in the divine generation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same metaphor of the Father's female anatomy is present in the Church's repeated use of Ps. 109:3 (LXX) in the Byzantine rite Christmas services. When we sing, ‘From the womb before the morning star have I begotten (or borne, ©necœmmgs› ) thee’, to celebrate Christ's Incarnation, this refers to his eternal generation from the Father, his eternally foreordained generation in time from his Mother, and the ontological relationship linking them as two births of a single person. An appreciation of the close analogy between the Father and that human parent whose generation is most like his, the Mother of God, is intrinsic to the faith and worship of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sanctity and likeness to God of human motherhood are firmly established through the Theotokos. Her parenthood is the most exact human icon of the divine fatherhood. Because of the way he is begotten from the Father, it was fitting for the Son to become incarnate through virginal conception and birth from a woman rather than in any other human way. So to call God Father is not to make an anthropomorphic assertion of his maleness, since the content of his name ‘Father’ is understood through the character of his generation of the Son. Divine fatherhood is not a projection of the human; rather all earthly fatherhood is named after the divine Father and thus called to be his icon. Divine fatherhood expresses the Father's generous and respectful relationship to his Son, and human fatherhood is called to become an icon of that manner of parental relationship to offspring. And together with the Theotokos all mothers are called to be icons of the Father in a similar way. Through her, the principle expressed in Eph. 3:15 can be extended to all parents. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p553"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Feminism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Christ as Male</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because there is no gender in the divine nature, the maleness of Christ is located in his humanity, not his divinity. So it is more an issue of Christology and theological anthropology than a Trinitarian issue. I have discussed it in Harrison (1998) but will add a few observations here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ's humanity is more important soteriologically than his maleness, and therefore more important to his person and work. He saves humankind by sharing everyone's humanity and uniting it with the divine, first in himself and then in his mystical body. So a serious question arises: since he did not assume femaleness, how can he save women? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Church's answer is that he dwelt in his mother's womb and was born of her, and thereby he united with God and thus healed and sanctified what is distinctive in wom <b class="calibre3">(p. 526) </b>an's biology, namely what belongs to the reproductive process. Cyril of Alexandria explains how the curse that Eve suffered due to the fall is healed by Christ's birth: Understand that the Only-begotten was made flesh, that he endured to be born of a woman for our sakes, to put away the curse pronounced upon the first woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For to her it was said, ‘In pain you shall bring forth children’ [Gen. 3:16]; for it was as bringing forth unto death, that they endured the sting of death. But because a woman has brought forth in the flesh Emmanuel, who is life, the power of the curse is loosed. (Smith 1983: 52)</p>
<p class="calibre1">So both genders are united with God in him, and both, insofar as they differ, are saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine suggests this in one of his Christmas sermons, which says of Christ, ‘Since he had created both sexes, that is, male and female, he wished to honor in his birth both sexes, which he had come to save’. The text adds that he also wished to honour both because both fell, so God has not wronged either men or women: ‘In regard to neither sex, then, should we do injury to the Creator; the nativity of the Lord encouraged both to hope for salvation. The glory of the male sex is in the humanity of Christ; the glory of womanhood is in the Mother of Christ’ ( <i class="calibre4">Sermon</i> 190.2, PL 38: 1008; Muldowney 1977: 24–5). So if the Saviour had been born female of a woman, could the male have been left out of the process of incarnation and salvation? He is Saviour of both women and men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ can be called both the Father's voice and the Father's breast, as he brings us both Word and Sacrament. He comes to us both as Bridegroom and as Mother, so we become both his beloved and his children. Symbolic language speaks of Christ in terms of various human family relationships, since he gives us all the kinds of love that come to us from different people in different ways. Our responses can be diverse, too. As his body we can have him acting through us, as we act along with him. Also, as his bride we encounter him as the beloved Other, who sometimes comes to us in the people we meet. The first is symbolically a masculine role, the second is symbolically feminine. Yet as we live in the Church's community, both men and women fulfil both of these roles in different situations. Therefore, Christ's role as Bridegroom does not limit either women or men in their access to him. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Feminism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Trinity as Community</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Orthodox and western theologians today often believe that the  <i class="calibre4">imago Dei</i> is located in humankind as a whole, so that human community images the Trinity. Community is thus an important facet of the multidimensional divine image. Since human beings are persons, whose identity is grounded in their relationality with others, they are images of the divine persons. Accordingly, people are inherently equal in their mutuality and are created for a free, loving, and mutually respectful communion and collaboration with each other. This aspect of Trinitarian theology clearly resonates with feminist sensibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet could there be a difficulty in reconciling this concept of equality and mutuality with the biblical and patristic idea of God the Father as the principle of unity in the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 527) </b>triune Godhead, and as the unoriginate source of the second and third persons and of the common will and activity the three share? Leonardo Boff (1988: 137–45) and Catherine LaCugna (1992: 266–78) have discarded this idea on the grounds that such a Trinity would become a paradigm justifying oppressive human ‘patriarchy’. They would argue that because a human community bearing the image of such a model would be morally abhorrent, this characterization of God must be mistaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Orthodox theologians have reaffirmed the Father's role as source of Godhead and divine unity so as to emphasize that the ultimate principle is a person, not an abstract essence or matrix of relationality. The result appears to be a new impasse between eastern and feminist approaches to Trinitarian theology. Yet the Trinity, as understood by Orthodox Christians, can rightly serve as a model for human community, and the Father in particular can provide a superb model for human leadership. In John's Gospel, we read that the Father has given the key divine attributes of glory and judgement to the Son, and yet the Son seeks only to glorify the Father and defer to his judgement. They turn toward each other in mutual love, self-giving, and humility. Surely this is essential to the life of the Trinity (Staniloae 1980). It is expressed vividly in Andrei Rublev's famous icon, where the three angels look humbly and steadfastly toward each other (Bunge 2007). No one of the divine persons seeks to keep anything for himself alone, apart from the other two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, we must also take account of where the analogy between divine and human forms of community breaks down, where humans are unlike the divine persons. God's activity is one; it originates in the Father and is accomplished by all three divine persons together, such that each is willing and doing the same things. Yet even when they collaborate on a single task, people are each choosing and doing different things. When three carpenters build a house together, each hammers different nails. So unity and diversity in humankind and in God function differently. In human community, a choice must be made between different ways of imaging the Trinity, between unanimity rooted in obedience and free co-operation bridging differences. To avoid totalitarianism, we must choose to image the Trinity through a free collaboration that affirms the equality and dignity of all human persons. As Metropolitan Kallistos Ware writes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p555"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Feminism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Each social grouping—family, parish, diocese, Church council, school, office, factory, nation—has as its vocation to be transformed by grace into a living icon of [the Holy Trinity], … to effect a reconciling harmony between diversity and unity, human freedom and mutual solidarity, after the pattern of the Trinity. Our belief in a Trinitarian God, in a God of social inter-relationship and shared love, commits us to opposing all forms of exploitation, injustice and discrimination. (Ware 1986: 17–</p>
<p class="calibre1">18)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsewhere, he adds that faith in the Trinity commits Christians to fighting for justice and human rights and against poverty, exploitation, oppression, and disease (Ware 1997: 142). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Trinity, the Father is the source of hierarchy but is equally the source of conciliarity. He provides origination, unity, and structure to the Trinity, whose life is itself unbounded mutual love and relationality. Dumitru Staniloae (1980) rightly distinguishes between the relations of origin in God and the perichoresis of the persons. The  <b class="calibre3">(p. 528) </b>relations of origin have a sequential order and thus a hierarchical structure, so that the persons can be identified as first, second, and third. Yet in begetting the Son and breathing forth the Spirit, the Father constitutes himself and them as completely equal, sovereign, and free, as joined by mutual love in unlimited mutual indwelling and interpenetration. So they give themselves to each other freely and without limit in every direction. This movement of love is not restricted but rather is supported and enabled by the structure of their relations of origin. Thus in the Trinity hierarchy supports and enables conciliarity; it provides the space within which relationships of mutual equality, freedom, and love can occur, flourish, and find their fulfilment. In this way the Trinity provides a good model for human community, where the proper function of hierarchical leadership should be to provide the stable context within which collaborative relationships of mutual love, freedom, equality, and dignity can arise, be preserved, flourish, and attain their full potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Human fatherhood—and by extension all forms of human leadership—thus has the vocation to become in a very real sense the image and likeness of the humble, generous divine fatherhood. As William J. Abraham (1997: 120) observes, ‘It is surely obvious that the form of patriarchy we encounter in God could be profoundly subversive of the kinds of patriarchy we encounter in the world’, and further, ‘encounter with the fatherhood of God may totally transpose our understanding of what it is to be a human father’, or a leader of any kind. The divine exemplar shows that the purpose of human hierarchy is not to withhold but to share, not to exclude but to include, not to push people down but to lift them upward, not to create barriers and distances but to establish community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A Trinitarian model for human community, rightly understood, provides a strong foundation for a feminist vision of the ideal human society. God the Father, who shares all he is with the Son and the Spirit and receives their gifts in return, who uses hierarchy to establish equality, provides a good model for human parenthood and all human leadership. His generation of the Son is a model for both human motherhood and fatherhood. The Son, incarnate in a woman's womb and as a man, redeems and sanctifies all humankind. Like a mother and like a bridegroom, he enters into deep relationships of love with men and Page 10 of 13</p>

<p class="calibre1">women alike, unworthy as we are. He bestows on us frail creatures the Holy Spirit and brings us to his humble and generous Father. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article explores the relation between politics and the doctrine of the Trinity. It describes the works of twentieth-century theologians who brought together the Trinity and politics in order to show what such a conjunction can and cannot do. It criticizes social Trinitarianism on the grounds that it grants too much to Immanuel Kant's reduction of religion to the sphere of practical reason and shows that the true political relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity consists in the fruitfulness of our participation in the Trinitarian life of God as it is revealed to us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: politics, Trinity, social Trinitarianism, Immanuel Kant, reduction of religion, Trinitarian life <b class="calibre3">Trinity, Politics, And Modernity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is something peculiarly ‘modern’ in the question of the relationship between the doctrine of the Trinity and how one might think about politics. The explicit suggestion that there is a connection between how one thinks about political life and how one understands God as Father, Son, and Spirit is rare, if not entirely unknown, prior to the twentieth century. In this essay, I will focus on twentieth-century theologians who bring together ‘Trinity’ and ‘politics’, in an attempt to show what such a conjunction can and cannot do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before looking at specific theologians, however, we might ask why modern Christians would suddenly turn to the doctrine of the Trinity as a resource for thinking about politics. This can best be understood if we see it as part of a larger shift in philosophy and theology regarding how we understand the nature of talk about God. If I might take Immanuel Kant as a representative modern figure, one can see in his philosophy the transformation of God from something to be speculatively contemplated into a postulate of practical reason—something of which we can have no knowledge, but which we must posit in order to undergird morality. As Kant puts the matter, ‘It concerns us not so much to know what God is in himself (his nature) as what he is for us as moral beings’ (Kant Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1960: 130). In the relocation of religion in the realm of practical reason, much Christian doctrine concerning God would seem to vanish, being irrelevant to us as moral beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, for Kant, once we are no longer concerned to know God  <i class="calibre4">in se</i> but only  <i class="calibre4">pro nobis</i>, we can abandon the doctrine of the Trinity, at least as something that says something true about God. As Kant puts it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the doctrine of the Trinity, taken literally, has no practical relevance at all, even if we think we understand it; and it is even more clearly irrelevant if we realize that it transcends all our concepts. Whether we are to worship three or ten persons in the Deity makes no difference (Kant 1979: 67). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 532) </b>Because the Trinity both transcends all our concepts  <i class="calibre4">and</i> has no practical moral relevance, it cannot even properly be called a ‘mystery’ in the way that creation or atonement or election can (Kant 1960: 133–4). It is, it seems, simply sophistry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If God in modernity must become a postulate of practical reason, then one possible way to acquit the doctrine of the Trinity of the charge of irrelevance would be to show that it is a valuable  <i class="calibre4">practical</i> resource for human political and social life. Thus the very topic </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Trinity and politics’ answers to a modern exigency, and we ought not to be surprised if theologians who deal explicitly with this connection are found almost exclusively in the modern period. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Modern Schematic Approaches</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Surveying the last hundred years, we find two approaches to the question of the Trinity and politics that might be characterized as ‘schematic’, by which I mean that they take the Trinity as offering a pattern or paradigm that can be employed in reflection on human social life (I have also discussed these two approaches in Bauerschmidt 2007). The first, which obeys Kant's strictures most faithfully, is the approach exemplified in the American Protestant theologian H. Richard Niebuhr. In this approach, the relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity has nothing to do with what it does or does not say about God; it is an entirely anthropological doctrine. According to Niebuhr, ‘Trinitarianism is by no means as speculative a position and as unimportant for conduct as is often maintained’. Instead, it addresses the quite practical problem of ‘the relation of Jesus Christ to the Creator of nature and Governor of history as well as the Spirit immanent in creation and in the Christian community’ (Niebuhr 1951: 80–1), which for Niebuhr is a problem of knowledge. That is, it is a meta-doctrine that co-ordinates three sources of religious knowledge: nature, history, and experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Niebuhr works this out most fully in a 1946 essay entitled ‘The Doctrine of the Trinity and the Unity of the Church’ (in Niebuhr 1996). In this essay, Niebuhr presents the Trinity as a way of holding together the three ‘Unitarianisms’ that are the  <i class="calibre4">de facto</i> religion of Christians: the Unitarianism of the Father, which focuses on creation, reason, and natural law; the Unitarianism of the Son, which focuses on salvation, revelation, and the Sermon on the Mount; and the Unitarianism of the Spirit, which focuses on contemporary experi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p561"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ence, both individual and communal. One can say that for Niebuhr the doctrine of the Trinity has the pragmatic value of holding together reason, revelation, and experience and, in terms of ethics, of balancing natural law, the teachings of Christ, and conscience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity becomes a way of saying that in their practical lives Christians do not need just natural law, which might lead to a staid conventionalism, but also the revealed teachings of Jesus; at the same time, the sometimes impractical teachings of Jesus need to be balanced with the demands of human nature; and both of these need to be in turn balanced with individual conscience and contemporary experience, which have the role of adjudicating conflicts between the demands of nature and the demands of the Gospel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 533) </b>Niebuhr's concern, at least in part, is to counter the putative ‘Christo-monism’ of theologians like Karl Barth who, by their strong focus on Christ and their criticisms of appeals to both nature and experience, would seem to restrict the ability of Christians to enter into public discourse with non-Christians. Niebuhr's positive point is that it is a fully Trinitarian faith—with its claim that God reveals himself in nature and experience as well as in history—that allows Christians to enter into civic discourse in a religiously diverse society. Though a secular polity might not allow appeal to the historical revelation of truth in Jesus Christ, appeal can still be made to nature and conscience as a common ground shared by all people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The problems with this approach are obvious. First, from a doctrinal point of view, the account of the Trinity Niebuhr offers is a modalist one at best: ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Spirit’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">are simply ways of naming the activity of God as eternal creator, historical redeemer, and personal inspirer. Second, the distinctions between reason, history, and interiority seem to be worked out prior to their correlation with the names ‘Father’, ‘Son’, and ‘Spirit’. Not only does the Trinity not reveal anything about God  <i class="calibre4">in se</i>, it does not really reveal anything about God  <i class="calibre4">pro nobis</i>; one can know quite well that God is creator, redeemer, and inspirer—that God is known through reason, history, and interior reflection—without any knowledge of the Trinity. How is the Christian's ‘Trinitarian’ account of nature, historical revelation, and experience any different from that of a Jew or Muslim? Third, as Niebuhr presents it, the doctrine of the Trinity tells us that an adequate Christian ethics must take account of nature, history, and experience, but says nothing about  <i class="calibre4">how</i> these three are to be related. Does nature always trump history, such that political positions based on the teachings of Christ (e.g. non-retaliation or the prohibition of divorce) have no place in the public realm? Is it the role of experience to interpret nature and history, or is experience shaped historically, or given naturally, or is it somehow both? Were Niebuhr more inclined toward Trinitarian speculation, he might have claims that there is a  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> or ‘mutual indwelling’ of nature, history, and experience, but even this claim does nothing to help sort out the priority given in concrete situations to these different sources of ethical reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Niebuhr uses it, the Trinity is at best a heuristic device for talking about something that we know on an entirely different basis; at worst, it is simply linguistic decoration. To be fair to Niebuhr, this is something of which he is well aware. At the end of ‘The Doc</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p562"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">trine of the Trinity and the Unity of the Church’ he notes with sincere modesty that what he has said is ‘only one approach, and that not the most significant or promising’ (Niebuhr 1996: 62). At the same time, I would note that this is the  <i class="calibre4">only</i> approach to the doctrine that Niebuhr himself took in his writing. James Gustafson notes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘through and through, his reflections about God were impregnated by his Kantian mentality and his Troeltschian learning, which led him to take statements about God very seriously, without taking them with the seriousness that assumed he or any other man was making literal statements about the One beyond the Many’ (Gustafson 1963: 27). In the end, Niebuhr's appeals to the doctrine of the Trinity are less a defence of the doctrine than it is an occupation by a foreign power: God is driven entirely out of the doctrine and its linguistic shell is transformed into a vehicle for anthropological statements. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 534) </b>The second approach, more common today than Niebuhr's approach, is to see in the communion of Father, Son, and Spirit a model of human community. This approach does make a genuine claim about the divine nature and has a respectable, if not lengthy, pedigree. In  <i class="calibre4">Gaudium et Spes</i> (paragraph 24) we read that there is ‘a certain similarity between the union of the divine persons and the union of God's children in truth and love’ (Tanner 1990: 1083). Numerous recent examples of this approach can be given. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catherine Mowry LaCugna claims that Gregory of Nyssa's ‘idea of a shared divine  <i class="calibre4">arché</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">… contained the seeds of a radical social order’ (LaCugna 1993: 87). Michael Novak sees in the Trinitarian ‘pluralism-in-unity’ a ‘dark illumination’ of democratic capitalism, which is ‘a political economy differentiated and yet one’ (Novak 1982: 338–9). Leonardo Boff, in contrast, claims that within Trinitarian communion ‘mutual acceptance of differences is the vehicle for the plural unity of the three divine Persons’, and that ‘by their practice and theory, capitalist regimes contradict the challenges and invitations of Trinitarian communion’ (Boff 1988: 150). </p>
<p class="calibre1">One could go on at some length multiplying examples of this approach, which is usually characterized as ‘social Trinitarianism’. This approach does not employ Trinitarian doctrine in the purely pragmatic and heuristic way that H. Richard Niebuhr does. LaCugna, who in places seems very wary of talk about God as Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">in se</i>, clearly maintains that the Trinity truly is how God is  <i class="calibre4">pro nobis</i>—the God revealed in the economy of salvation is the triune God. Many of these thinkers are also cognizant of possible objections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miroslav Volf, for example, notes that ‘the road from the doctrine of the Trinity to proposals about global or national social arrangements is long, torturous, and fraught with danger’ (Volf 1998: 406) and points by way of example to the fact that Novak and Boff use the Trinity to underwrite quite different economic arrangements (Volf 1998: 419, n. 14). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, Volf, with a host of others, maintains that it is in some sort of ‘social’ account of the Trinity that the vital future of Trinitarian thought lies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst their differences, social Trinitarian approaches share some formal features beyond simply recommending the doctrine of the Trinity as a remedy for certain social and political ills. Primarily, they all emphasize the distinctness of the Trinitarian persons and are critical of western theology's purported emphasis on the unity of the divine nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Social Trinitarianism is ‘social’ not simply in taking the Trinity as a model for human soci</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p563"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">eties, but also in seeing the Trinity itself as a kind of divine society in which the divine persons have priority over the unity of essence. This, of course, makes a certain sense; if the Trinity is supposed to offer us a model for human persons in communion, then the closer the analogy between divine and human persons, the more effective the Trinity is as a model. It is noteworthy that Catherine LaCugna appeals to Andrei Rublev's icon in which the Trinity appears as the three visitors who received the hospitality of Abraham at Mamre as key for understanding the Trinity. This icon depicts a community of which we can see ourselves as part (LaCugna 1993: 83–4). We might say that social Trinitarianism encourages us to look at Rublev's icon and take our place at the table, or perhaps simply to arrange ourselves at our own tables in a similarly egalitarian manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the hegemony of what Karen Kilby calls this ‘new orthodoxy’ in Trinitarian theology, a few critical voices have begun to be raised. Kilby herself argues that what we <b class="calibre3">(p. 535) </b>find in social Trinitarianism is a process by which theologians first identify  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> as the name of whatever it is that makes the Father, Son, and Spirit one. The meaning of  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> is then supplied by projecting onto God what we value most in our relations with other human beings (e.g. warmth, love, empathy, equality). Finally, the divine  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> is offered as the model for human interrelation. Kilby acknowledges that all our human talk about God inevitably involves some projection of human qualities and values onto God, but what she finds so problematic about the projection involved in this case is the way in which what we project onto God is immediately commended to us as what is most significant about the Trinity (Kilby 2000: 442). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kathryn Tanner also raises several issues with regard to this approach. She points out first that appeal to  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> yields a very vague politics. As she puts it, unless one purports to know much more about relations among the Trinitarian persons than is probably warranted, one is still left with very vague recommendations—about the social goods of equality, a diverse community, and mutual relationships of giving and receiving. All the hard, controversial work of figuring out exactly what any of that might mean … seems left up to the ingenuity of the theologian to argue on other grounds. (Tanner 2004: 325) Tanner further points out that much of what Trinitarian doctrine says about the persons of the Trinity simply cannot apply to human persons. In particular, human persons are not constituted by their relations, at least not in the same sense that Trinitarian persons are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, human relatedness is marked by sin in a way that divine relatedness is not, and any moral theology or politics that ignores this can hardly be relevant. She notes, ‘To a world of violent, corrupt and selfish people, the Trinity seems to offer only the feeble plaint, “Why can’t we all just get along?” ’ (Tanner 2004: 326). </p>
<p class="calibre1">One might, of course, argue that the violence, corruption, and selfishness that we find in human political struggles have some sort of analogue in God. Thus Thomas Parker writes that ‘The Trinitarian life of God as a  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> of the “persons” embraces the struggle for community as well as the achievement of communion’ (Parker 1980: 179). Yet the risks involved in such a strategy ought to give one pause. Are the Persons of the Trinity Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p564"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">really involved in a ‘struggle for community’? If so, with whom are they struggling? Each other? Would it not be saner to see the human struggle for community as a result of our fallen state, or even our creaturely finitude, and not something that can be projected onto God? Otherwise, the Christian understanding of God lapses into mythology. This seems too high a price to pay for political relevance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The critiques of both Kilby and Tanner focus on how the attempts of social Trinitarianism to make the Trinity relevant to practical concerns fail because they simply impose on the doctrine a set of ethical positions that are in fact held on other grounds. In this way, social Trinitarianism does not seem all that different from the more ‘modalist’ approach of H. Richard Niebuhr. Both approaches risk simply applying a theological gloss to a predetermined set of political and ethical concerns and are really more about us than they are about God. Also, both of these approaches might be characterized as ‘schematic’, in that the doctrine of the Trinity is emptied of its specific content so as to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 536) </b>serve as a schema or blueprint for various commendable things—whether the avoidance of Christomonism or the ideal of a peaceful communion of persons. What seems lost is the Trinity itself: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Both of these approaches fail to the extent that they present the doctrine of the Trinity as being about something other than the Father who sends the Son into the world for our redemption in the Spirit. Any political relevance of the Trinity must be found not in abstractions made from the doctrine, but in the actual life of God as this is revealed to us in its threefold fullness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Reading the Fourth Century</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">These schematic approaches are not the only modern attempts to think ‘Trinity and politics’. A significantly different approach can be found in two twentieth-century interpretations of Trinitarian disputes of the fourth century: the work of the German Catholic patristics scholar Erik Peterson and the American protestant Church historian George Huntston Williams. Their work is significant not only as an interpretation of the fourth century, but also as creative contributions to political theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In ‘Der Monotheismus als politisches Problem’, first published in 1935, Peterson argues that certain early Christian thinkers, most notably Eusebius of Caesarea, developed a ‘political theology’ based on a dual premise: that the monarchy ( <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i>) of God was mirrored on earth by the monarchy of the Roman Emperor and that the Roman Empire played a providential role is establishing the peace necessary for the spread of the Gospel. It is the former claim that concerns us here, because it is precisely this claim that Peterson sees as destroyed by orthodox Trinitarian theology (the latter claim, according to Peterson, is destroyed by the eschatological reserve of thinkers like Augustine; see Peterson 1951: 103–4). In the approach outlined by Peterson, the orthodox understanding of God as Trinity is a hedge against any attempt to sacralize politics by claiming its adherence to a divine pattern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p565"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson argues that there develops in the world of Greek thought a line of argumentation that links divine monarchy with political monarchy. Peterson further argues that in Philo (the first to use the term  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i>) we have a fusion of the politically inflected philosophical monotheism of the Greeks with the Biblical monotheism of Judaism. In this fusion, Philo purges the model of divine governance of its polytheistic overtones by an emphasis on a divine monarch who rules by law, rather than through lesser gods (1951: 59–60). Philo's association of monotheism and  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> is taken up by early Christian apologists, such as Justin. Peterson also notes that it is used in attempting to formulate Christian Trinitarian faith by theologians such as Tertullian, who appeals to the idea of the Roman co-principate as a way of arguing against the modalism of Praxeas—that is, Father and Son share their  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> the way rule can be shared by a king and his son (Peterson 1951: 70–1). After the Peace of the Church, this approach to thinking of God in terms of  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> and its association with the Roman Empire becomes even more politically freighted. This is, according to Peterson, particularly the  <b class="calibre3">(p. 537) </b>case with Eusebius of Caesarea, for whom ‘the  <i class="calibre4">one</i> monarch on earth—and that is for Eusebius no one other than Constantine—corresponds to the  <i class="calibre4">one</i> divine monarch in the heavens’ (Peterson 1951: 92–3). Peterson concludes his argument with some brief remarks indicating how the orthodox Trinitarian theology developed by the Cappadocians and other pro-Nicene theologians undercut the possibility of using  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> to develop a political theology. Semi-Arians like Eusebius continued to understand the divine monarchy by analogy with the monarchy of the Roman Emperor, in which power derives from a single person (the Father) to the exclusion of all others. Understood in this way, ‘monotheism is a political requirement, a piece of Imperial politics’. Peterson contrasts this with a passage from Gregory of Nazianzen's  <i class="calibre4">Third Theological Oration</i>, in which Gregory, while still affirming the <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> of God, associates it with all three persons of the Trinity, thereby distancing it from any earthly  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> (Peterson 1951: 102–3). Gregory writes: monarchy is that which we hold in honor. It is, however, a monarchy that is not limited to one person, for it is possible for unity if it is at variance with itself to come into a condition of plurality; but one that is made of an equality of nature, and a union of minds, and an identity of motion, and of a convergence of its elements to unity—a thing which is impossible to the created nature. ( <i class="calibre4">Third Theological Oration</i>, ch. 2, in Handy 1954: 161;  <i class="calibre4">cf</i>. Peterson 1951: 103 and 144 n. 164) What is notable here is the distance Gregory places between the divine  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> and any created  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i>. The shared  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> of Father, Son, and Spirit in no way provides a model for earthly rulers, and therefore provides no legitimation for them either. In this way, Peterson forestalls any ‘political theology’, if one understand by this the claim that particular human political arrangements follow a divine pattern of rule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, this is not to say that orthodox Trinitarian theologians in the fourth and fifth centuries were never enthusiastic supporters of the Roman Empire and never indulged in the kind of rhetoric associated with Eusebius, for whom Constantine ‘provides an example of divine monarchic sovereignty’ ( <i class="calibre4">Tricennial Oration</i>, ch. 3, in Cunningham 1982: 51). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor is it to say that semi-Arian Trinitarian theology, which was more or less the tradition</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p566"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">al subordinationist theology of the third century, was embraced by Eusebius simply because of its utility as a political theology (for a nuanced reappraisal of Eusebius’ theological interests, focusing more on his providential reading of history than on his Trinitarian theology, see Hollerich 1990). What Peterson suggests, rather, is that the ‘low’ Christology of the semi-Arians, for whom the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> serves essentially a mediatorial function between God and the world, is more easily at home with the idea of the emperor as the earthly correlate to the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>. As Eusebius puts it, the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> is ‘the light that transcends the universe and surrounds his Father, mediating and keeping the Eternal and Uncreated Form apart from all that is created’ and is also the one by and through whom ‘the emperor, so favored by God, receives an image of the heavenly kingdom and, in imitation of the greater Master [that is, the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i>], pilots and guides the course of the ship of state’ ( <i class="calibre4">Tricennial Oration</i>, ch. 1, in Cunningham 1982: 48). Thus, on Peterson's reading, both the Arian emphasis on the sole  <i class="calibre4">monarchia</i> of the Father, along  <b class="calibre3">(p. 538) </b>with the view of the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> as the quasi-divine mediator between the uncreated God and creatures, enabled a political theology in which the monarchy of the emperor was the earthly image of God's monarchy, and his ordering of the Empire was an imitation of the  <i class="calibre4">Logos</i> ordering creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson's suggestion regarding orthodox Trinitarian theology was taken up and developed with great vigour by George Huntston Williams in a lengthy 1951 essay, in which he argued that the high Christology of the pro-Nicene theologians, along with their correlatively high doctrines of the Eucharist and the Church, not only forestalled the political use of theology, but actually pushed these theologians toward a conflictual relationship with the Empire. The root of this conflict was the assertion by pro-Nicene theologians of the authority of Christ over that of the emperor and the insistence that the Spirit-filled Church, rather than the Empire, was the exemplary form of universal human community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Williams sums up his conclusions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a consequence of their high Christology, the Catholics could not so easily see in the emperor a kind of temporal savior, coordinate with Christ, nor could they yield to the God-ordained emperor as a source of authority in matters of faith and order superior to the earthly Christ. Caesar, merely for being a Christian, could not usurp the place of God. The primary loyalty of the Nicene Christian could be to no other than to the historic  <i class="calibre4">and</i> eternal Christ, fully God, to the tradition embodied in his Church, and to the consubstantial Holy Spirit suffusing this Church with grace, peculiarly present in the apostolic bishops (Williams 1951b: 21–2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Williams argues that the pro-Nicene party's conviction that the historical Christ was God, <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> with the Father—and that Christ's laws and traditions therefore took precedence over the laws and traditions of the emperor—made them much less supine in the face of imperial interference with the Church. Likewise, Nicene convictions regarding the Spirit led them to assert the rights of the Church over and against the claims of the Empire: it is the Church and not the Empire that is the  <i class="calibre4">oekumene</i>, and the emperor is a member of and subject to the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p567"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Williams admits that ‘the Arianizing view of the divine authority of the Christian emperor’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">is something that must be reconstructed ‘from the meager and disparate remains’ (Williams 1951a: 25). While Williams can cite an impressive array of texts to support his views, in the end there are many gaps that must be filled in with supposition and conjecture. We might wonder the degree to which those embroiled in the debates over the Trinity in the early Christian centuries were conscious of the political implications that Peterson and Williams find in their different positions. Perhaps, for example, Constantius’ enthusiasm for Arian theology is purely coincidental, and had he been zealously orthodox it would have been the Arians, and not the orthodox, who resisted the claims of the state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In assessing the work of both Peterson and Williams, it is important to bear in mind the context in which, and the purposes for which, they wrote. Peterson's target is clearly not fourth-century Arianism but the ‘political theology’ of Carl Schmitt, who wrote in 1922 </p>
<p class="calibre1">that ‘a continuous thread runs through the metaphysical, political, and sociological conceptions that postulate the sovereign as a personal unit and primeval creator’ (Schmitt 1985: 47; on Peterson and Schmitt, see Geréby 2008). Specifically, Schmitt understands the sovereign to be ‘he who decides on the exception’ (Schmitt 1985: 5), meaning that sovereignty is ‘principally unlimited authority, which means the suspension of an entire existing order’ (Schmitt 1985: 12). Schmitt later notes that ‘the exception in jurisprudence is analogous to the miracle in theology’ (Schmitt 1985: 36). In another work, first published in 1932, Schmitt writes, ‘The juridic formulas of the omnipotence of the state are, in fact, only superficial secularizations of theological formulas of the omnipotence of God’ (Schmitt 1996: 42). He criticizes liberal political orders for creating a social order without the sovereign exception, thus losing ‘the decisionistic and personalistic element in the concept of sovereignty’ (Schmitt 1985: 48). Liberal Democracy, by eliminating true sovereignty, the sovereign power to make the exception, is the political mirror of Deism or pantheism. Against these liberal political philosophies Schmitt pits ‘Catholic political philosophers such as de Maistre, Bonald, and Donoso Cortés’ (Schmitt 1985: 53) to whom the elimination of the exception ‘must have appeared … to be a strange pantheistic confusion’ (Schmitt 1985: 61–2). In other words, liberalism was not simply an inadequate political philosophy; it was heresy, precisely because it denied the political equivalent of the miracle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson's opposition to Schmitt was not because he was a liberal stung by the charge of heresy, nor was it because he thought the profession of the Christian faith to be a purely private matter. Indeed, Peterson, a convert from Lutheranism, was quite traditional in his theological views, and in particular he rejected what he took to be the liberal protestant attempt to restrict Christianity to any realm of private interiority (Geréby 2008: 24; Hollerich 1993). The problem with Schmitt's political theology was not its anti-liberal politics <i class="calibre4">per se</i>, but its faulty theology. Nothing in Schmitt's account of ‘political theology’ would ever lead one to think that God is triune: that the Father has sent the Son so that we might live in the Spirit. Indeed, Schmitt's God might be characterized as an extreme form of the depiction of God in certain late-medieval nominalists: a hidden and capricious deity who at any moment might override the order established by God's ordained power ( <i class="calibre4">poten</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p568"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">tia ordinata</i>) through the exercise of the absolute power of God ( <i class="calibre4">potentia absoluta Dei</i>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power of God as Schmitt conceives it is that which flashes forth from outside the normal course of things, erupting from behind an opaque veil that is utterly impenetrable to reason. The mystery of sovereignty invoked by Schmitt is something quite different from the ‘open mystery’ of the triune God, in which human comprehension fails not because God is hidden, but because God is so fully revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, Schmitt rejects any political relevance to the teachings of Jesus, particularly his teaching with regard to love of enemies. For Schmitt, the concept of the political itself hangs from the distinction between friend and enemy (Schmitt 1996: 26). Political identity is only secured by an ‘other’ with whom ‘we’—those of us who are ‘friends’—have a relationship that is essentially conflictual. Christ's command to love our enemies does not, according to Schmitt, apply to the enemy in this political sense: ‘in the private sphere only does it make sense to love one's enemy…. It certainly does not mean that one should love and support the enemies of one's own people’ (1996: 29). Neither does Schmitt take account of the New Testament notion of friendship with God, which John's Gospel places in an explicitly Trinitarian context: Jesus’ disciples are no longer slaves but  <b class="calibre3">(p. 540)</b> friends because he reveals to them  <i class="calibre4">everything</i> that he has heard from his Father (Jn 15:15), and they will be confirmed in this friendship by the Spirit of truth, whom Christ sends from the Father to testify on his behalf (Jn 15:26). This friendship with God established in Christ and the Spirit is able to overcome even the ‘otherness’ of sin, reconciling those who were formerly enemies of God (Rom. 5:10). Thus the world that hates Jesus and his disciples (Jn 15:18–25) is precisely the enemy that God sent the Son to save and not to condemn (Jn 3:16–17). Thus Peterson rejects Schmitt's political theology not because it is political, but because it enshrines as normative a sub-Christian conception of God: a sovereignty and monarchy more suited to paganism than to the Church. It is this, rather than the theology of Eusebius or other semi-Arians, that is his true target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Likewise, George Huntston Williams is more concerned about mid twentieth-century mainline Christians in America who lie supine before the State than he is about similarly supine fourth-century Arians (in light of the strong claims he makes for the value of Nicene orthodoxy, it is interesting to note that Williams was, at least by ecclesiastical affiliation, a Unitarian—albeit a ‘Trinitarian Unitarian’). Williams's abiding interest in the question of Church and State, and his own opposition to McCarthyism, the Vietnam War, and legalized abortion testify to a life spent pushing Christians in a counter-cultural direction (Church 2007). Though surely not intended as such, his account of the Trinitarianism of the pro-Nicene party of the fourth century might be read as a rejoinder to H. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard Niebuhr's appeal to Trinitarianism as a cure for ‘Christo-monism’. As Williams sees it, and in this he is surely correct, the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity does not in any way mitigate the significance of Jesus Christ (history) by ‘balancing’ him with the Father (nature) and the Spirit (experience). Rather, ‘the authentic Nicenes held tenaciously to the historic Christ who, by his unique and paradoxical act of divine self-sacrifice at once secured the eternal salvation of mankind  <i class="calibre4">and established the ecclesiastical law to which</i> <i class="calibre4">even the Christian sovereign is subject</i>’ (Williams 1951a: 16, emphasis in the original). In claiming that the historical figure Jesus of Nazareth is  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> with the Father, the Page 10 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p569"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">pro-Nicene party commits itself to, if not a Christo-monism, certainly a Christological intensity that is not subjected to any balancing act. The subsequent affirmation of the divinity of the Spirit, and the identification of the apostolic and sacramental Church as the principle (albeit not exclusive)  <i class="calibre4">locus</i> of the Spirit's activity, makes clear that it is this community, and not any empire, that can claim the status of being God's people (Williams 1951b: 12). The Christological and Pneumatological vigour of the pro-Nicene theologians gave them the theological resources necessary to maintain the ancient Christian conviction that the Church is a distinctive people, set apart from the world for the sake of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A Way Forward? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Trinitarian reflections of Peterson and Williams are quite different from those either of Niebuhr or of the social Trinitarians. Do they point a different way forward in thinking about the connection of Trinitarian theology and politics? I think that they do. Peterson points out the danger of trying to place the doctrine of the Trinity—or any doc <b class="calibre3">(p. 541)</b> trine of God—into direct service undergirding a particular politics. The example of Carl Schmitt shows us how the Christian understanding of God can be warped when it is expected to answer to the exigencies of a particular political vision. Williams, on the other hand, shows that Trinitarian theology, while not directly applicable to political questions, is still relevant in thinking of how the Church relates to various forms of worldly power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it is not relevant because the divine life provides an image of human community, nor because it gives us a formula for balancing sources of ethical reflection. It is relevant because it tells us that Jesus of Nazareth is Emmanuel, God with us, and that his Holy Spirit gives life to an ecclesial community that has its own public, ‘political’ identity. In other words, the doctrine of the Trinity is politically relevant precisely because it is neither more nor less than what Christians have always taken it to be: a way of understanding the claim that in Christ and the Spirit we encounter God directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David H. McIlroy, in a recent work that offers an example of a Trinitarian ‘political theology’ that both avoids the dangers identified by Peterson and has the robust Christological and Pneumatological contours that Williams identifies, helpfully distinguishes between two different ways of thinking about the Trinity and politics. He writes: On the one hand, there is the model of God standing on one side and human beings on the other. That which is to be found on one side of the divide is to be mirrored on the other side. On the other hand, significance may be drawn from the way in which the triune God invites human beings to participate in God's triune life. On this account, God the Holy Spirit seeks to transform human beings into the likeness of God the Son and to bring them into relationship with God the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(McIlroy 2009: 14)</p>
<p class="calibre1">McIlroy later goes on to note, ‘the deployment of the Trinity as a bare image is an inadequate and misplaced use of the doctrine’ (McIlroy 2009: 208). Rather than a bare image, we need the full-blooded narrative of God's triune identity as revealed in the economy of Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p570"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity and Politics</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">salvation. Thus, if we wish to speak of a Trinitarian political theology, then we ought to eschew any attempt to make the Trinity into a schema or pattern that we are to imitate, and speak instead of how God the Holy Spirit conforms us to Jesus Christ so that we becomes sons and daughters of God the Father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The political relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity only reveals itself as Christians attempt to live out their Spirit-given conformity to Christ. If they do so, they will not have to worry about Kantian concerns over the practical import of the doctrine of the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who rule over others with the power that grows from what Augustine called the  <i class="calibre4">libido dominandi</i> will quickly recognize that the people who have been marked by baptism in the triune name pose a threat to such power, simply by showing the world that there is another way for human beings to live together, a way that Christ lived with his disciples and which the Spirit makes possible even today in the community of the Church. This is not to say, of course, that the Church as a whole always, or even often, lives in this way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the political relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity remains directly proportional to the faithfulness of the baptized, to their living out of the distinctive way of Christ, the way of friendship with God through the Spirit. It is in such faithfulness that the disruptive insertion of the triune life into human history becomes visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 542) </b>Earlier I mentioned the Rublev icon of the Holy Trinity, noting how its three angelic figures seated around a table are sometimes taken to embody what, in social Trinitarianism, seems most important about the Trinity: the model of a community of equals that we humans can mirror. What I am suggesting, in contrast, is that we think instead of an image like Masaccio's fresco of the Trinity in Santa Maria Novella in Florence. This painting takes the form of the traditional medieval representation of the Trinity known as the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘mercy seat’, in which the crucified Christ is supported by God the Father, with the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, flying between them. The figure of Christ is flanked by Mary and John, who are in turn flanked by the two kneeling donors of the painting. Through his innovative use of perspective, Masaccio is able to locate the Trinity in its own ‘space’, seeming to lie in a chamber beyond the walls of the Church, preserving the Trinity as something true of God  <i class="calibre4">in se</i>. Yet this same use of perspective allows him to depict the crucified one being projected into our space by the figure of the Spirit, so that the form of the crucified is impressed upon the viewer who contemplates this image. We are not invited to imitate the Trinity, but rather to receive the image of the crucified, who receives his formative power from his place within the Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">taxis</i>. And this formative power is manifested in the saintly figures of the Beloved Disciple and the Blessed Mother who stand on either side of the cross as figures of the Church triumphant, but also in the images of the donors, who kneel on a visual plane between the saints and us as figures of the Church suffering, for whom we are bidden to pray. And ultimately this formative power is manifested in us, the viewers, who are the Church militant, on pilgrimage to the Kingdom. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Abstract and Keywords</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This article examines the relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity for modern ecumenism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It explains that the doctrine of the Trinity has featured prominently in modern ecumenical conversation because theologians and Church leaders have engaged in bilateral and multilateral dialogues have drawn upon the rich seam of Trinitarian thought. It shows how the agreement of Christians regarding the doctrine of the Trinity has stimulated efforts to extend this agreement to other areas of faith and practice informed by Trinitarian reflection. It also evaluates important contributions in this regard by George Lindbeck and Robert Jenson, among others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: ecumenism, Trinity, Trinitarian thought, theologians, Church leaders, George Lindbeck, Robert Jenson THE doctrine of the Trinity has featured prominently in modern ecumenical conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is both a cause and an effect of the twentieth-century revival of interest in the doctrine. Theologians and Church leaders engaged in bilateral and multilateral dialogues have drawn upon the rich seam of Trinitarian thought found in Barth, Rahner, and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, however, scholars have been stimulated by the ecumenical consensus surrounding the doctrine of the Trinity and have sought to develop this in almost every area of the subject. In what follows, several foci of important concern will be identified—</p>
<p class="calibre1">mission, communion, worship, and the nature of doctrine. Recognition of the gains that have been made in these areas may help to counteract the more negative and pessimistic reception of ecumenism in the early twenty-first century. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Ecumenical Context</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The significance of the doctrine of the Trinity for modern ecumenism is evident in the amended description of the World Council of Churches as a Christian fellowship in 1961. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its earlier founding formula of 1948 referred simply to its confession of ‘Jesus Christ as God and Saviour’. This reflected the core commitment of the YMCA in the nineteenth century, and it was supported by theologians such as James Denney around 1900. However, a Page 1 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p574"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> more explicit commitment to the triune identity was introduced with an extended formula. ‘The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfil together their common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit’. Although less succinct and even laborious, this addendum succeeded in satisfying  <b class="calibre3">(p. 548)</b> various ecumenical concerns that had become pressing in the post-war period. Visser ’t Hooft, the first Secretary General of the WCC, later reflected on the process that led to the elaboration of the statement. In its explicit reference to the Trinity, the Council was responding to the concerns of the eastern Church—especially Russian and Greek Orthodox delegates at their meeting in Leningrad in 1959—which insisted that the Christocentric affirmation must be placed in a Trinitarian setting. This did not require an elaborated description of the Trinity, only a clear reference. It seems that the matter was thus resolved quite suddenly. ‘So I took the breakfast menu and wrote on it the doxological formula: “to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit”. This proved to be acceptable to all who were present’ (Visser ’t Hooft 1985: 173). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The accentuation of the doctrine of the Trinity was evident in all the main Christian communions during this period. Important influences included Karl Barth's  <i class="calibre4">Church Dogmatics</i> which had begun the exposition of the Church's faith with the doctrine of the Trinity, thus almost exactly reversing the order of exposition in Schleiermacher's  <i class="calibre4">Glaubenslehre</i>. This positioning of the doctrine would later be recognized by Jüngel and others as a hermeneutical decision of the greatest importance, unprecedented since Peter Lombard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had the effect of securing a Trinitarian determination of all the doctrines of the faith, thus ensuring their distinctive Scriptural and Christian character. On the Roman Catholic side, Karl Rahner complained about the textbook prioritization of  <i class="calibre4">de Deo uno</i>, over against  <i class="calibre4">de Deo trino</i>, which had promoted an incipient unitarianism or modalism in Christian thought and action. By identifying the economic with the immanent Trinity, he sought to repair the tradition at this crucial juncture. Important Orthodox influences were also evident in ecumenical circles, these being articulated in John Zizioulas’ high-profile study <i class="calibre4">Being as Communion</i> (Zizioulas 1985). For Zizioulas, the doctrine of the Trinity, particularly as expounded in Cappadocian theology, is vital for a proper account of ecclesiology and anthropology. His capacity to bring Orthodox insights into the western academy contributed much to a wider ecumenical appreciation of Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed, as Geoffrey Wainwright has pointed out in a significant article on this theme, the flurry of books after 1970 on the doctrine of the Trinity itself represents a concerted ecumenical and international effort to register its significance for Christian life and understanding in the modern world (Wainwright 1998: 96–7). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity, of course, was strategically advantageous for the ecumenical movement by virtue of its fourth-century Nicene setting. Arianism having been defeated, the dogmatic declaration at the Council of Constantinople in 381 had appeared to settle the shape of the Christian doctrine of God for all subsequent generations. Despite later Socinian and Unitarian scruples, this was confirmed by much Church history; all the mainstream confessional bodies acknowledged the classical doctrine. At the time of the sixteenth-century Reformation, it was a matter of supreme importance for Calvin and oth</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p575"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> ers to demonstrate their continuity with the teaching of the ancient Church. Hence the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity could transcend the divisions between the West and the East (the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> apart), and also those of Roman Catholic and Reformation Church. By returning to this common source and norm, modern ecumenical dialogue could seek <b class="calibre3">(p. 549) </b>to advance on different fronts by exploring the consequences of a shared Trinitarian and incarnational faith for contested issues in, for example, Church, sacraments, and ministry. George Lindbeck, who had been heavily involved in several dialogical bodies, could speak of the Nicen0-Constantinopolitan Creed as a mighty symbol of the unity of the Church across space and time (Lindbeck 1984: 95). As a doctrinal standard with extensive liturgical usage, it functioned uniquely as an expression of historical and contemporary Christianity. Indeed so overwhelming did this consensus become that some theologians (for example, Maurice Wiles) would eventually complain that critical questions about the Trinity and the Incarnation were difficult to pose. In an ecumenical climate that treated these with such a deferential and determined consensus, there was a reluctance to revisit Enlightenment criticisms about the speculative and historically problematic features of these doctrines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In securing the Nicene doctrine of God and in particular the consubstantiality of the Spirit with the Father and the Son, Athanasius and the Cappadocians had appealed to the common practice of baptism in the threefold name. Already apparent in the words of the risen Jesus in Matt. 28:19, the baptismal formula became an important resource for theological reflection. A parallel phenomenon can also be discerned in modern ecumenism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shared rite of baptism provided an opportunity for the mutual recognition of different confessional bodies. Even where communion was impaired and imperfect, it was secured by a baptism that could be widely recognized across the mainstream confessional bodies, or at least amongst those that practised infant baptism. This has been a significant gain of the second half of the twentieth century, enabling the recognition of a genuine faith in other churches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Faith and Order movement of the World Council of Churches made significant advances throughout the twentieth century, partly through building upon these shared assumptions about the doctrine of the Trinity. Its most significant achievement was the convergence statement on  <i class="calibre4">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry</i> ( <i class="calibre4">BEM</i>, widely available online) agreed at Lima in 1982. In each of its three main sections, the text reflects the strong consensus on the Trinitarian faith, by offering an account that is both Christocentric and strongly pneumatological. Baptism is in the threefold name and attests our participation in the death and resurrection of Christ and entry into the fellowship of the Spirit; the eucharist is ‘essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">BEM</i> 1982: EII.2); and the ministry of the Church rests upon the prior ministry of Christ. ‘Belonging to the Church means living in communion with God through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit’ ( <i class="calibre4">BEM</i> 1982: MI.1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following the celebrations of the 1600th anniversary of the 381 Council of Constantinople, the Faith and Order Standing Commission produced an explication of Christian doctrine in the form of a commentary on the Nicene Creed.  <i class="calibre4">Confessing the One Faith</i> (1991) Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p576"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> was the impressive result of some years of study and discussion, although its labours have generally not received the recognition and attention that they deserve. The exposition of the Creed is here not intended merely to identify a settled consensus regarding how the faith is to be expressed and understood. Instead, it  <b class="calibre3">(p. 550) </b>recognizes the need for ongoing doctrinal assessment, and the importance of continual repentance and renewal through a return to the apostolic faith. Seeking a unity in diversity, it acknowledges the different cultural, social, economic, political, and religious contexts in which increasingly the churches are placed. So attention is given to issues raised for and by the doctrine of the Trinity around religious language, feminism, social justice, secularism, and other faiths. The explication of the faith is thus not simply a historical exposition but includes its interpretation amidst fresh challenges and cultural shifts. Much is made of the plural form of the opening verb—‘we believe’ rather than ‘I believe’—as an expression of a shared faith. Jaroslav Pelikan, the historian of dogma, frequently asserted his preference for this over against the Apostles’ Creed with its opening words ‘I believe’. It is the faith of the whole Church that is affirmed and shared. At times when one's own faith falters, he argues, we can repose upon the faith of the community that nurtures and sustains us. We confess the faith within the communion of saints. In explicating the doctrine of the Trinity, the text points to the distinctiveness of the Christian doctrine of God as one being in three persons and what this entails. In particular, it conjoins the power and the love of God, the unity and diversity of divine action, and notions of divine transcendence and immanence so that these are not separated in ways that distort important convictions. Here several unhelpful dualisms and monisms are resisted by reflection upon the proper understanding of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. There is no monotheism of arbitrary divine power and aloofness from creation, nor is there a pantheism of total immanence and absorption in the world process. The Nicene doctrine of God enables the avoidance of these temptations, which remain perennial for Christian thought and action. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Filioque</b></i> <b class="calibre3">Clause</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">An obvious focal point of ecumenical discussion of the Trinity has been the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> clause inserted into the Latin version of the Creed and formally approved in 1014. This describes the Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son ( <i class="calibre4">qui ex Patre Filioque procedit</i>). It has historically divided the eastern and western Churches. The Orthodox complaint is <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> that it was unilaterally inserted without ecumenical approval; <b class="calibre3">(2)</b> that it confusingly suggests two sources of origin in the Trinity, that is to say, the Father alone as the begetter of the Son, and the Father and the Son as source of the Spirit, thus detracting from the role of the Father as the sole source of origin within the Trinity; and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> that the subordination of the Spirit to the Father-Son nexus tends to depersonalize the Spirit while also obscuring its role in empowering the Son throughout his incarnate life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p577"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> In response, western theologians have tended to argue that <b class="calibre3">(p. 551)</b> <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> the Spirit's dependence upon the work of the Son and subsequent release in the life of the Church are better captured by the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> clause; and <b class="calibre3">(2)</b> that without it, there is no determination in the Nicene Creed of the relationship of Son to Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much ecumenical discussion has attempted to get behind a decision over whether to include or to omit the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> by exploring the issues at stake (Vischer 1981). Are there concerns on each side which can be met in other ways? To a significant extent, that has proved possible. On the eastern side, it is recognized that the Father is always the Father of the Son. So in the procession of the Spirit, the Father never acts apart from the Son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly, in begetting the Son, the Father never acts apart from the Spirit. In the relation of origins within the Trinity therefore, the acts of begetting and spiration properly belong to the Father whose identity cannot be expressed apart from Son and Spirit. Moreover, there is a recognized need to understand the Son and the Spirit as in a relationship of mutual dependence and empowerment. The action of the Spirit precedes the coming of Jesus (e.g. in his conception), and the Spirit descends upon him (e.g. in his baptism). </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the Spirit is also the one who is sent by Jesus and is subsequent to his ministry, according to John 20 and Acts 2. In acknowledging these shared convictions, many western churches have felt able to dispense with the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> clause on the first ground that its initial insertion was a unilateral addendum to the original ecumenically agreed text. In its 1995 statement on ‘The Greek and Latin Traditions Regarding the Procession of the Holy Spirit’ (widely available online), the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity affirmed that the one source of origin in the Trinity is the Father while also stressing the ways in which the Spirit and the Son are eternally related. The Spirit proceeds from the Father but always by and through the generation of the Son, hence ensuring its fully Trinitarian character. A similar attempt to circumvent historic divisions is found in the Orthodox-Reformed Agreed Statement on the Holy Trinity which avoids all mention of the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This priority of the Father or Monarchy of the Father within the Trinity does not detract from the fact that the Father is not properly Father apart from the Son and the Spirit, that the Son is not properly Son apart from the Father and the Spirit, and that the Spirit is not properly Spirit apart from the Father and the Son. Hence the  <i class="calibre4">Monarchia</i> of the Father is perfectly what it is in the Father's relation to the Son and the Spirit within the one indivisible Being of God. (Torrance 1993: 223) <b class="calibre3">The</b>  <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Missio Dei</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With its roots in the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910, the modern ecumenical movement viewed the unity of the Church and the task of mission as closely related. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since unity is a sign of the reconciliation and healing brought to the world by the Gospel, its absence must inevitably impair the mission of the Church. Outside the traditional con</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p578"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> fessional divisions of the western Church, there were growing concerns to overcome <b class="calibre3">(p. 552) </b>doctrinal and organizational differences that seemed matters of relative importance alongside the sharing of central convictions, resources, and activities. For many, the model of the Church of South India pointed the way forward. Having successfully integrated Episcopalian, Methodist, Congregationa, and Presbyterian churches in 1947, it heralded the prospect of other unions in different global contexts. In identifying a common faith, a united Church could draw upon the Nicene tradition of the ancient Church with its commitment to a Trinitarian and incarnational faith. The work of Lesslie Newbigin provides a prominent example of this appropriation of classical theology to express the ecumenical and missiological responsibilities of the contemporary Church. Writing of the Trinitarian action of God, Newbigin stresses the extent to which the Christian community reposes upon the prior work of Father, Son, and Spirit. The Church and its missiological action are thus given a Trinitarian shape. Here Newbigin draws upon the concept of the  <i class="calibre4">missio Dei</i>, a notion often associated with Karl Barth although its provenance in his writings is now contested. According to this shift of perspective, the Church receives its mission from the prior sending forth of the Son into the world by the Father in the power of the Spirit, a movement that corresponds to the eternal processions in the Godhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The mission is God's, not ours’ (Newbigin 1978: 19). As itself a sign of the divine mission, the Church is thus confronted to become what it is, namely, one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. In similar vein, Vatican II in its decree  <i class="calibre4">Ad Gentes</i> (1965) describes the missionary activity of the Church as based upon the eternal missions of the Son and Spirit proceeding from the Father's ‘fountain-like love’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dependent upon the  <i class="calibre4">missio Dei</i>, the Church's mission is derivative, partial, and not merely for itself. Instead of understanding it as a programme of ecclesiastical expansion, theologians now described it in relation to the wider purposes of God for the world. This was apparent in the work of the Willingen conference of the International Missionary Council in 1952. In writers like Moltmann, the primacy of the divine mission shaped an understanding of subsequent ecclesial mission. The Church neither initiates nor exhausts the mission of God. It participates in that mission but its impetus and scope are other than the Church. ‘It is not the Church that has a mission of salvation to fulfil to the world; it is the mission of the Son and the Spirit through the Father that includes the Church, creating a Church as it goes on its way’ (Moltmann 1977: 64). Mission here becomes an activity that is constitutive of the triune God. Its location in the doctrine of God promoted a view in which the Church was an instrument of divine mission rather than itself the source of missionary activity. ‘To participate in mission is to participate in the movement of God's love toward people, since God is a fountain of sending love’ (Bosch 1991: 390). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The concept of the  <i class="calibre4">missio Dei</i> was closely related to the idea of the kingdom of God as an eschatological reality to which the Church bears witness. No longer an ark into which people are gathered from a perishing world, the Church is a sign or herald of the coming salvation of the world. With this more universalist thrust, ecclesiology was set in a different relationship to the eschatological kingdom. However, this missiology also risked the danger of evacuating mission of its distinctive reference to Christ and of the Church as his body into which we are baptized. Much of the secular theology of the 1960s moved Page 6 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p579"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> <b class="calibre3">(p. 553) </b>in this direction, creating a corresponding unease around the idea of the  <i class="calibre4">missio</i> <i class="calibre4">Dei</i>. This produced further reflection on the relation between Christ, Church, and the mission of God in Newbigin and others. The tendency to identify the  <i class="calibre4">missio Dei</i> with a secular struggle for liberation elicited critical comment, particularly through the discussion generated by Latin American liberation theology from the 1970s. In many ways, the holistic strains of this movement were affirmed by missiology—Christian missions had long concerned themselves with education, health provision, social service, and the development of agriculture. The refusal to separate the public from the private, self from society, and body from mind required a commitment to social justice and welfare. There could be no retreat of Christian mission from the secular into a private religious domain. Yet the kingdom of God could not be identified exclusively with any political movement or social process—the capacity of sin to reassert itself required an eschatological reserve. Obedience to the crucified Christ as the eschatological Lord required mission to confess his name in Word and sacrament. The Church might not have monopolistic rights over the mission of God, but it could not ignore its responsibility to bear witness to the name of Jesus. ‘The Church can only represent the righteousness of God in history in the way that Jesus did. It is enabled to do this by being constantly reincorporated into Jesus’ saving action through baptism and the Eucharist and through the preaching and hearing of the Word’ (Newbigin 1978: 125). Nevertheless, the concept of the  <i class="calibre4">missio Dei</i> continues to be useful in linking the Church's activity to the action of God, and of clarifying the relationship of dependency and derivation of one from the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Communion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The concept of  <i class="calibre4">koinonia</i> (variously translated as communion, fellowship, or community) has proved an important resource in ecumenical conversation for at least fifty years. Its linkage to the doctrine of the Trinity is explicit and frequently rehearsed in the literature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, the third Assembly of the World Council of Churches meeting in New Delhi in 1961 describes the unity of the Church in the following terms. ‘The love of the Father and the Son in the unity of the Holy Spirit is the source and goal of the unity which the Triune God wills for all men and creation’ (Kinnamon and Cope 1997: 88). Communion is made possible by the action of God; as such, it does not derive from particular ecclesiastical structures. Hence a federation of institutional churches may express something of that communion that is a gift of the Trinity. An important Scriptural warrant for this is the prayer of Jesus which petitions for the love between Father and Son to be imparted to the disciples ‘that they may all be one’ ( Jn 17:20). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attention to  <i class="calibre4">koinonia</i> has been repeated in successive bilateral and multilateral dialogues. These include the dialogues between the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church and that between the latter and the Orthodox Church.  <i class="calibre4">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry</i> (1982), as already noted, pays close attention to the notion of communion in its eucharistic theology as does much Roman Catholic theology since Vatican II. On the other hand, <b class="calibre3">(p. 554) </b>this has also yielded closer attention to ways in which communion remains imperfect, particularly in dealing with divisive issues such as the ordination of women, the na</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p580"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> ture and function of episcopacy, and the sharing of the sacrament. Nevertheless,  <i class="calibre4">koinonia</i> can remain genuine even when its expression is impaired. In an important study of its significance, Nick Sagovsky has drawn attention to the ways in which this has been a persistent ecumenical driver since the time of the New Testament (Sagovsky 2000). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ecumenical scholars, influenced particularly by the contribution of eastern Orthodoxy, have stressed the extent to which the concept of the ‘person’ as an ontologically irreducible notion emerged through the influence of Trinitarian theology. Its categorial links to notions of freedom, love, and relationality were developed by the Cappadocian theologians and also by later Franciscan theologians such as Richard of St Victor. By stressing that the being of God was constituted by the eternal origination of the Son and the Spirit from the Father, the classical doctrine of the Trinity understood the life of God to include an interpersonal communion. Even when the Father is viewed as the fount and origin of divinity within the Godhead, this does not undermine the essential relationality of the Trinity since the Father is eternally the Father of the Son and the Spirit, and can never be Father except in relation to these other persons. This was not viewed as an epiphenomenon or a temporal manifestation but as essential to the triune identity. The characterization of the person as relational was also set in opposition to more modern notions of the individual as an autonomous centre of consciousness. Human fulfilment is to be realized not in autonomous choice but in the proper expression of personal and social bonds. This has important ethical and political ramifications in much of the literature. The report of the British Council of Churches on ‘The Forgotten Trinity’ seeks to negotiate a middle way between the errors of individualism and collectivism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our particular contribution is to draw upon our understanding of the triune God to call attention to particular and central features of our common humanity: our freedom to be with and for each other; our relations which yet respect the otherness, particularity and uniqueness of every human person; and the communion which may be realised through our free and particular relatedness. (British Council of Churches 1989: 25)</p>
<p class="calibre1">One cautionary note might be sounded in relation to much of this literature. According to some critics, it has become too easy, especially following the fashionable preference for social models of the Trinity, to move swiftly from the Trinitarian  <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> to somewhat bland assertions about anthropology, ethics, and politics (Kilby 2000). The link is at best analogical, especially if tritheism is to be avoided, so that the connections between human communities and the divine life require to be carefully explicated. There is a danger of projecting on to the life of God whatever is desirable for human life; this fails to respect not only the mystery of the Trinity but also the function for which it is was first intended in Nicene theology, namely to articulate the unity of God and the reality of Jesus as the self-revelation of the God of Israel. In any case, historical correlations of Trinitarianism with egalitarian democracy on the one side and monotheism with hierarchical and authoritarian styles of government on the other are highly tendentious. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p581"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> <b class="calibre3">(p. 555) Worship</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As Geoffrey Wainwright has noted, the most outstanding event of the liturgical movement in the Church has been the recovery of the ‘paschal mystery’ as a Trinitarian event at the centre of Christian worship (Wainwright 1998: 110). Christ offers himself to God the Father through the Holy Spirit (Heb. 9:15). The Father raises the Son from the dead by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 1:3). Represented in worship, this turning of God towards us is most apparent in the liturgy for the eucharist, particularly the anaphora. Many modern eucharistic prayers adopt a Trinitarian pattern, based originally upon early Syrian models. Addressed initially to the Father, such prayer proceeds to confess Christ crucified, risen, and present, and then to invoke the Holy Spirit. As Bryan Spinks has pointed out, without a proper Trinitarian shaping of the liturgy, western Christians untrained in academic theology can hardly be blamed for harbouring Unitarian or binitarian notions of God (Spinks 1996: 224). </p>
<p class="calibre1">By stressing worship as an action of God into which we are drawn by the Spirit, several scholars have pointed to the way in which this releases us from perceiving worship merely as a human response to what God has already done (Torrance 1996). While there is a danger of generating a theological abstraction that diminishes the local and particular elements of worship, this provides a welcome corrective to somewhat sterile and didactic habits which fail to register the momentous character of Sunday worship. Its dramatic quality is displayed by characterizing worship as an action of God in and for the community of faith, with the dynamics of this event being described in Trinitarian language. As a gracious and liberating event that has its source in the life of God, worship can be delivered from more debilitating notions of contractual obligation and a sense of routine drudgery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reception of  <i class="calibre4">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry</i> suggests that its most successful section was its second on eucharist. Significantly, the work invested in this material was enabled by a convergence of liturgies, through the efforts of the liturgical reform movement. These resulted in an acceptance of a common style of eucharistic worship that tends to move from thanksgiving offered to the Father, through the remembrance of the work of Christ, to the invocation of the Spirit. The place of the  <i class="calibre4">epiklesis</i>—the invocation of the Spirit—owes much to the Orthodox influence and has now become a standard element in most western liturgies. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Theological By-Products</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most important by-products of modern ecumenical dialogue has been George Lindbeck's  <i class="calibre4">The Nature of Doctrine</i>. Much discussed in the closing stages of the twentieth century, Lindbeck's proposal was that doctrine be viewed as akin to a grammar generating the rules governing theological speech. Important doctrinal decisions reflect rules that were adopted by the Church in the face of tendencies that threatened  <b class="calibre3">(p. 556) </b>to subvert core convictions. On this reading, a doctrine is not so much a proposition that mir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 9 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p582"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> rors some transcendent reality as a norm that governs the first-order language of confession and creedal commitment. What is often overlooked is that Lindbeck's short treatise was largely the product of many years steeped in bilateral and multilateral dialogue—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lindbeck indeed had been a Lutheran observer at Vatican II. His work has occasioned widespread discussion though there is little consensus yet as to its significance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The key ecumenical proposal in  <i class="calibre4">The Nature of Doctrine</i> is that doctrinal disputes be seen as generated by the application of rules in shifting historical contexts. Once consensus can be secured on the appropriate rule, it may be possible to relativize the disagreements surrounding its expression at particular moments in the history of the Church. Doctrines can be both constitutive in terms of defining rules and also illustrative of correct usage, this latter function being more common. In terms of the former, doctrine is akin to a set of grammatical rules governing a language. These rules help to determine the vocabulary of the religion (i.e. its symbols, concepts, rites, injunctions, and stories) and how these are to be interpreted and practised (Lindbeck 1984: 80–1). The rule theory of doctrine is further characterized by a taxonomy of doctrines in Lindbeck. Some doctrines are unconditional (e.g. the law of love) but others are conditional (i.e. dependent for their emergence on a particular context). This latter category admits a further division of irreversible and reversible. Some doctrines (e.g. the prohibition of slavery) may have emerged relatively late in the history of the Church but are now regarded as irreversible. Others that have been widely held (e.g. the immortality of the soul) might be regarded as reversible, given the recent tendency towards more holistic anthropologies. One striking feature of this taxonomy is the way in which it exposes disagreements around Mary, the papacy, justification, etc. as disputes about the content of constitutive rules and whether some of the historical applications of these rules might now be judged reversible. For example, might one view the immaculate conception as generated by rules surrounding the role of Mary in salvation under the conditions of prevailing Augustinian assumptions about sin. Within that context the application is valid, but outside it perhaps not irreversible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One can say, for example, that it is only in the context of a questionable Western theology and sense of sin that it is necessary to exempt the Mother of our Lord from all natal stain in order to maintain her God-given and God-dependent freedom in saying “yes” to the angel's terrifying announcement (Lindbeck 1984: 97). </p>
<p class="calibre1">With respect to Nicene theology, Lindbeck claims that for Athanasius the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son should be understood as expressing a rule that whatever is said of the Father is said of the Son, except that the Son is not the Father. He goes on to propose that three regulative principles are at work here: <b class="calibre3">(1)</b> there is only one God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus; <b class="calibre3">(2)</b> the stories of Jesus refer to a historical individual who lived in a particular time and place; and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> the principle of ‘Christological maximalism’ is that every possible importance is to be attached to Jesus in a manner consistent with the previous rules (Lindbeck 1984: 94). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 10 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p583"></a><b class="calibre3">Ecumenism and the Doctrine of the Trinity Today</b> <b class="calibre3">(p. 557) </b>The Nicene Creed and the Chalcedonian formula might then be understood as attempts to articulate these rules in terms of the conceptuality available at that time. This leaves open the possibility that the rules may yet be maintained in other contexts but differently formulated. ‘There may, on this reading, be complete faithfulness to classical Trinitarianism and Christology even when the imagery and language of Nicaea and Chalcedon have disappeared from the theology and ordinary worship, preaching, and devotion’ (Lindbeck 1984: 95). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether doctrines can be seen merely as providing second-order grammatical rules as opposed to making first-order confessional truth claims is not altogether clear. Lindbeck acknowledges the importance of the latter, but these are enabled by doctrinal rules rather than identified with them. For many critics, however, this sharp distinction has proved problematic. While the Nicene Creed undoubtedly generates norms about how Jesus is to be understood and attested, it is hard to resist the view that it also appears to be making some strong truth claims about his identity. Its widespread doxological function moreover appears to suggest not just its irreversibility for all Christians but its capacity to make these first-order ontological claims. For this reason, one may need to regard the distinction between rules and truth claims as a fuzzier one, a difference in degree rather than in kind. On the other hand, Lindbeck's work enables us to make sense of the importance of some quite rarified controversies (e.g. the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>) without assuming that theologians have some privileged access to the interior workings of the divine essence. Significantly, the sorts of resolution to the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> clause noted above tend not to argue that one side is simply right over against the other (as if a theological X-ray of God's being would settle the matter) but rather to point to the ways in which we have to regulate, for example, what is said about the relationship of Jesus to the Spirit in order better to read the Gospel story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In all these ways, there is a significant extent to which ecumenical dialogue has both enriched and itself benefited from the renaissance of Trinitarian theology in the twentieth century. It is ironical, therefore, that one of the most trenchant analyses of ecumenical theology has perceived the lack of a full-blown Trinitarian theology to have been the main impediment to overcoming classical doctrinal disagreements between East and West and between Roman Catholic and Protestant. Robert Jenson's  <i class="calibre4">Unbaptized God</i> is one of the most theologically accomplished assessments of recent ecumenical progress, but his main contention is that the lack of a full Trinitarianism, especially with respect to the Spirit, has vitiated attempts to overcome disputes surrounding justification, the real presence, Scripture and tradition, the  <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>, justification, and office and charism (Jenson 1992). </p>
<p class="calibre1">His book has not yet received the attention it deserves, perhaps a sign of the recent loss of momentum in ecumenical theology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article explores the Jewish-Christian dialogue regarding the doctrine of God. It examines two encounters that occurred during the patristic and medieval periods and two encounters that occurred in the past thirty years. It explains that while the former two encounters were hampered by Christian inability to articulate the doctrine of the Trinity, the latter two show signs of promise. This is part because both the Jewish and the Christian participants share a debt to Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, and Abraham Heschel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: Jewish-Christian dialogue, doctrine of God, Trinity, Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Abraham Heschel INTERRELIGIOUS dialogue is a modern notion. Perhaps its earliest appearance is in Lessing's comedy,  <i class="calibre4">Nathan the Wise</i> (1779), that promotes respect, communication, and friendship among religions. Previously, the primary stance was contempt, the mode of communication between Judaism and Christianity was polemic. Public disputation was mandated by Christians bent on converting Jews. The Jewish goal was to thwart that design. Polemic is a war of words, and these sometimes spilled over into violence as in the burning of many folio volumes of the Talmud in France in 1242–4 (the exact number of volumes and manuscripts burnt is still subject to discussion among scholars, see Sirat 1999). These are not dialogical conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dialogue takes place on a level playing field between peers, in which each sets his own terms of participation. For example, the original title for this essay was ‘The Trinity in Jewish-Christian Dialogue’. But that title sets the conversation on Christian terms. That puts the burden of proof on Jews, when Christians are the ones pressed to argue that they remain monotheists. A dialogical way of coming at the topic is the current title, the ‘Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue’. It recognizes that we are dealing with two theological frameworks and respects both. We shall examine two such dialogues here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interreligious dialogue seeks a path to mutual theological acceptance rather than theological hegemony. Further, the hope is to understand one's own theological commitments better through engagement with the other. The possibility of conversion is always possi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 1 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p587"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> ble, of course, but that is not the goal. Here, one comes to the table to learn from one's interlocutor, not to defeat her. It is an exchange of gifts, not a war of words. Dialogue requires a posture of accompaniment, even mutual encouragement, without a predetermined outcome. The virtue of respect calls for accompanying the other as far as possible in a sincere effort to arrive at improved understanding of the other and a clearer vision <b class="calibre3">(p. 560) </b>of the truth of one's own heritage (Swidler 1981; Swidler 2008). Dialogue, then, is a posture of open listening to the other in an intentional conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On these terms, there has not been much Jewish-Christian dialogue on the Trinity. There have been a good number of Christian and Jewish polemics aimed at one another where the Trinity is sometimes debated (Lasker 2007: 45–104). There has also been Jewish-Christian dialogue where Trinity has not been central (Rosenzweig 2005; van Buren 1980, 1983, 1988). Selecting appropriate material for review here is challenging since a single work may have both polemical and dialogical features or presuppose the differing doctrine of God without directly addressing the topic. Here we look at actual theological encounters or reports of them between Jews and Christians where the doctrine of God is addressed directly or indirectly. They are Justin Martyr's  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> (Justin 2003), the Barcelona disputation of 1263 (Maccoby 1982), a face-to-face dialogue between Pinchas Lapide and Jürgen Moltmann (Lapide and Moltmann 1981), and a literary exchange between Peter Ochs and David Tracy (in Frymer-Kensky et al. 2000). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">1. </b> <b class="calibre3">An Early Encounter: Justin And Trypho</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the mid-second century, Justin of Nablus records a two-day discussion with an urbane and engaging Jew, Trypho, and some of his friends, that purportedly took place in Ephesus at the time of the Bar Kochba revolt against Rome (132–5) (Justin 2003). It is a substantial work. Justin gives long speeches. Trypho and his companions are silent during some of these, but Trypho does make short interventions of his own in which he questions Justin's answers and points the conversation in ways that he wants it to go. The winsomeness of the portrayal of Trypho invites conjecture that it reports a genuine encounter but not a verbatim report (Horner 2001: 12). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While intended to convert the Jews, the encounter is quite cordial and a dialogical tone prevails. Since the Nicene definition of Christ was still two centuries away Justin could not focus explicitly on the Trinity, but he does evidence elements of that later doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He hopes to persuade Trypho that Christianity is true using Christological exegesis of the Old Testament to prove that Jesus is the anointed Son of God and even God in the form of an angel apart from and subordinate to God the creator (Justin,  <i class="calibre4">Dialogue with Trypho</i> 56). </p>
<p class="calibre1">He organizes his points around what must be an early creedal formulation, a variant of our Apostles’ Creed. Doctrinal agreement between the interlocutors that the Father is the creator of all things provides common ground for the debate. The disagreement turns on the second article of the Creed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p588"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> Concatenating seven citations of, or allusions to, a creedal text that he had (36.5; 39.7; 57.3; 85.1, 2; 126.1 and 132.1), we see the Christian faith for which Justin argues. Jesus Christ was predicted by the prophets, assumed human nature, was born of a virgin, became a man, suffered under Pontius Pilate, died, arose from the dead, ascended into <b class="calibre3">(p. 561) </b>heaven to sit at the right hand of the Father, opened the gates of heaven, and shall return again in glory to judge everyone who ever lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Justin has elements of what would become Trinitarian doctrine. He has a doctrine of the pre-existence of the Son who would become Jesus at the Incarnation. From this he argues that Jesus is not of human origin (68.4), for ‘God has begotten of himself a certain rational power as a beginning before all creatures’ (61.1), following Prov. 8:22–3. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has a high logos Christology from which he argues that the incarnate one can be the mediator of creation and revelation (Grillmeier 1974: 89–94), but focuses primarily on Christ as the instrument of salvation. At the general resurrection, Christ will return to vanquish death for all. ‘Then, some  <i class="calibre4">will be sent to the judgement and sentence of fire, to</i> <i class="calibre4">be punished eternally</i>, while others will dwell with [God] free from suffering, corruption, sorrow, and death’ (45.4). Justin wants to enjoy that salvation with his Jewish friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to or perhaps as part of the logos Christology, Christ is an angel whose activities conflate with those of the Spirit. L. W. Hurtado and A. Briggman judge Justin to be binitarian (Hurtado 2008; Briggman 2009). At other points, Justin seems to offer ditheism as when he says ‘I shall attempt to prove my assertion, namely that there exists … another God and Lord under the Creator of all things, who is also called an Angel because he proclaims to man whatever the Creator of the world … wishes to reveal to them’ (56.4) (Juncker 1994). </p>
<p class="calibre1">From a Nicene perspective, Justin is confused, but to conclude that, as Briggman does, is anachronistic, because at the time there was no Trinitarian norm against which Justin's doctrine could be judged defective (Briggman 2009: 135). Justin has another concern: to persuade his Jewish friends that their teachers are wrong and that they should accept his scriptural exegesis instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For his part, Trypho is neither persuaded by Justin's exegesis nor frightened by the eschatological threat of the theistic sanction. He loves to talk theology and shares enough of Justin's presuppositions to have a coherent conversation much of the time. Yet he finds Justin's binitarian or ditheist claims incredulous and astonishing. That an eternal pre-existent God or Son of God was born of a virgin is ‘preposterous and incapable of proof’ (48.1). Tellingly, Justin admits that he cannot prove this claim but that it is not to be denied: ‘even though he apparently is of human origin, [Jesus] evidently became the Christ by the Father's choice’ (48.3). Without fear, Trypho finds the incarnational claim irrational and unsupportable (68.1). Justin, unable do prove the point, finally asserts ‘nothing is impossible and that God can do all things if he wills it’ (84.4). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 3 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p589"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> Thus, one side of Trypho's objection is rational and another is historical. Although the interlocutors share the messianic expectation of Isa. 9:6–7, and agree that the coming counsellor would be a messenger from God, as in Genesis 18, Justin cannot prove that Jesus is the one anticipated by this and other texts that Justin brings. Even if all the scriptural texts that Justin brings point to a messianic figure and Trypho agreed that they seem to, they do not demonstrate that the Nazarene is that one, let alone that such a messiah would be ontologically connected to God in a special way. Justin addresses neither concern directly. He does not counter that the Christian claims are rational, or that Jesus <b class="calibre3">(p. 562) </b>is the one. His suggestion that Lord in Jewish scripture implies someone of non-human origin is also not persuasive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We can summarize Trypho's role in the debate as his six objections to Justin's creedal claims:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> Justin cannot prove that Jesus is the one predicted by the prophets and is the anointed Son of God (48). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> He cannot prove that there is an additional God to the creator or that he condescended to be born of a virgin (50, 55). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> Using the Septuagint of Isa. 7:14 to support pre-existence of Christ based on the virgin birth is inappropriate because the Hebrew word means ‘young woman’ (43.8, where Justin acknowledges awareness of the problem; 67.1 and 84.3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> He has not proven that the God who appeared to Abraham was born, incarnated, and suffered like all others (57.3). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(5)</b> He has not shown that the Son pre-existed eternally (87.2). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(6)</b> Claiming crucifixion as a salvific event is impossible because it is a singularly accursed death according to Deut. 21:23. A curse could not be a blessing (89.2). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trypho agrees that the anointed one should suffer, but not that shameful death (89–</p>
<p class="calibre1">96). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exegetical debate held the field at that time. The speculative Trinitarian claim that Jesus Christ is  <i class="calibre4">homoousios</i> with the Father, that there are three hypostases of God, none of which engages time and space, was not yet in focus. Philosophical rationalism lay ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The issues argued would become standard and represented. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">2. </b> <b class="calibre3">Medieval Polemics And Disputations</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation was dramatically different in Christendom. The Church vigorously sought the conversion of Jews through polemical treatises, forced sermons pressured by civil disabilities. When these efforts succeeded, the Church enlisted the Jewish converts in the evangelizing effort, enriching the  <i class="calibre4">Adversus Judaeos</i> literature of earlier ages. This enabled Christians to switch from arguing exegetically to arguing on Jewish home territory: rabbinic literature. While the patristic age tolerated Jews, with the Inquisition and the mendicant orders the situation of Jews deteriorated. Polemics became fiercely defamatory and carried social and political consequences (Cohen 1982). As philosophy filtered into Page 4 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p590"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> European Christian lands, both sides adapted it to their needs so that Jewish scripture, rabbinic literature, and philosophy were all marshalled to convert Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish leaders tried to quell Jewish apostasy by rebutting Christian arguments in Hebrew treatises for Jews (Lasker 2007). Many anti-Christian arguments came from Arabic Muslim anti-Christian polemics. Daniel Lasker lists forty-one anti-Christian Jewish polemics, more than half of which contain philosophical refutations of the Trinity (Lasker 2007: 13–</p>
<p class="calibre1">20). Trypho's incredulity resounds in them. Jews continued to find the Trinity and other contested Christian doctrines illogical, nonsensical, and impossible to prove. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 563) </b>Anti-Christian polemics written by Jews for Jews, like the Christian anti-Jewish polemics that trained Christian preachers to evangelize Jews, do not fall strictly within the purview of this essay. However, the issues debated illustrate the state of the Trinitarian debate at the time. For example, presented with the proposal of one God in three Persons, Jews asked, if God is a Trinity of three distinct Persons, is God not a material substance? The idea that God is immaterial seems to be violated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, Christian polemicists, knowing that Jews accepted the notion of divine attributes, attempted to persuade Jews of the acceptability of the Trinity by misrepresenting the doctrine. They argued that the Persons merely instantiate divine attributes. Jews responded asking, if so, why limit interest to three attributes given that God has more than three attributes? This rebuttal of a misrepresentation of the Trinity had a long after-life and is still employed by Jews, as will be noted below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the reigning Aristotelian idea that God is thought thinking itself, eastern Christians forwarded the idea that the Father was the intellect, the Son the intellectually cognizing subject, and the Holy Spirit the intellectually cognized object (Lasker 2007: 77). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinity means the thinker, thinking, and thought of God that does not compromise the divine unity. Jewish apologists responded that the Aristotelian Christian view corrupted Aristotle's teaching and that there was no confluence between the Trinity and the Jewish appropriation of the Aristotelian teaching (Lasker 2007: 78–9). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinitarians argued that the Father generated the Son who later became incarnate. Jews denied the eternal generation of the Son because it implied multiplicity in God but mistakenly took the Arian position that the Incarnation implied that there was a time when he was not the Son (Lasker 2007: 85). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Disputations</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There were also three significant face-to-face disputations about the Talmud and Midrashim, spear-headed by Jewish apostates eager to convert other Jews. One, ordered by the Pope at Paris (1240) and held before the Queen of France, was a pretext for burning many folio volumes of the Talmud on the grounds that it blasphemed Jesus the messiah. The most important was at Barcelona, Spain (1263), before the King. A third was at Tortosa, Spain (1413/4), before the Pope. These were not free and open debates among peers, but interrogations of the rabbis present who were commanded to answer the ques</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 5 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p591"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> tions put to them. Of these three, only the reports of the Barcelona disputation mention the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Nachmanides and Friar Paul Christian (1263)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Friar Paul Christian, a converted Spanish Jewish Dominican, had access to the crown (Roos 2003). He persuaded King Jaime I of Aragon to convene a public debate between himself and Rabbi Moses ben Nakhman of Gerona (Nakhmanides, also known as the Ramban), a recognized authority of Catalonian Jewry (Maccoby 1982: 41). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 564) </b>The men faced off on 20–24 July 1263, in the royal court, with noblemen, ecclesiastics, and leading burghers of the town attending (Chazan 1992). We have two latter reconstructions of the event, one from the Ramban in Hebrew and a shorter anonymous one in Latin. The proceeding was dramatic. From the Ramban's account, the terms of the debate were first to discuss whether the messiah had come and then whether he was divine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the context of Christological debate, discussion of the Trinity was collateral, but according to both the Jewish and the Christian reports it surfaced in a visit the Dominican paid to the rabbi in Gerona in preparation for the event (Maccoby 1982: 144–5, 148). The friar asked the rabbi whether he believed in the Trinity. He responded, ‘What is the Trinity?’ and offered a few possible answers. Paul denies that any of these comes close and says that the Trinity is ‘Wisdom, will and power’, the common attempt to induce Jews to agree to the Trinity on a faulty representation. Nachmanides agrees that God is wise, that he wills and is powerful, but insists that these are all attributes of the divine essence and that the doctrine of the Trinity is an erroneous conclusion to draw from this claim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Latin report says that Paul diligently expounded belief in the ‘Holy Trinity, both as to the Unity of the Divine essence, and as to the Trinity of the Persons, as held by Christians’ (148). He adds that at the disputation, when asked about the Trinity, Nachmanides was silent. From this, the Christians erroneously inferred his assent to the doctrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was not a meaningful Trinitarian debate. It is not clear that any Jewish disputant adequately grasped the Christian doctrine or that the Christians were ingenuous about it, unless they too lacked sophistication on the topic. These three public disputations suggest that the doctrine of God was not a central point of engagement between Jews and Christians at that time. The concern was, as it had been for Justin, for Jews to admit that the messiah had come and that he was Jesus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">3. </b> <b class="calibre3">Modern Dialogues</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As noted at the outset, modernity swept in a fresh stance toward interreligious engagement. Here we find two Jewish-Christian dialogues on the doctrine of God. In both cases, each participant can stand in both theological frames of reference, even though Jewish contributors are not steeped in Trinitarian subtleties. Two published encounters are between Pinchas Lapide and Jürgen Moltmann and between Peter Ochs and David Tracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 6 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p592"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> <b class="calibre3">Lapide-Moltmann Dialogue</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On 22 May 1978, in a West German village, three decades after the slaughter of European Jewry, Pinchas Lapide, an orthodox Austrian Jewish theologian who escaped Hitler, and  <b class="calibre3">(p. 565) </b>Jürgen Moltmann, a German war veteran and prisoner of war who became a theology professor at Tübingen, held a public dialogue on monotheism and Trinitarianism. It was the first published interchange specifically on the doctrine of God between a Jew and a Christian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The format differed from all previous encounters. Here, each participant offered a prepared statement, first the Jew, then the Christian. Two rounds of impromptu dialogue followed, beginning with Lapide. The third stage of the event was audience questions. The slender volume concludes with an unprecedented interchange on ‘the positive meaning of the Jewish No to the messiahship of Jesus’ and an unparalleled ‘Common Declaration’ in which both prescind from ‘any artificial unifying of all paths of faith’. It pledges the signatories to pursue ‘a unity in plurality’ to replace the ‘trench of hostility’ that has characterized Jewish-Christian interaction over the millennia (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 91–2) with a ‘new dialogue between Christians and Jews’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The feat is moving. Thirty years earlier the soldier would have sought the death of the Jew. The dialogical model challenges the received paradigm of Jewish-Christian interaction. Here, mutual respect and a desire for understanding prevail. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Pinchas Lapide</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In his prepared statement, Lapide is clear that Jewish monotheism developed in staunch opposition to ancient polytheism. It does so, not by employing strictly rationalist forms of argument, but ‘from the inextinguishable Thou experience which reveals the Lord of the universe as an unutterable “over-against” ’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 27). The Buberian stress on revelation as encounter enables Lapide to view monotheism dynamically, as Moltmann also does. Divine oneness is not an ontological absolute, as Greek philosophy would have it, but an event that occurs through the unification of the hearts of believers under the lordship of the One God. Monotheism is to the scriptural end of the universal conversion of the world to the God of Israel, as Jews understand God. It is a unification of all believers under the lordship of the One God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lapide also turns to Martin Buber's friend and colleague, the great early twentieth- century Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig. He interpreted the  <i class="calibre4">echad</i> of the Shm’a (Deut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6:4) not as God's ‘being one’ ( <i class="calibre4">Eins-Sein</i>), but rather as the ‘ “union” ( <i class="calibre4">Einung</i>) of God’ that occurs ‘in the reconciliation of all contradictory dualism, which pressed toward a loving </p>
<p class="calibre1">“becoming one”—not only in the believing confession, but also in the realizing deed’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 32). Lapide pursues a dynamic monotheism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, rather than develop dynamic monotheism in conversation with the Christian doctrine of God, Lapide retreats into the classic Jewish comfort zone. He faithfully reports that Jews may read Trinitarianism as either a heavenly triumvirate or, worse, as tritheism. The incarnational claim qualifies for the derisive Talmudic term  <i class="calibre4">shittuf</i>, associ</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 7 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p593"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> ating elements of different kinds that fit ill together. Rejecting the divinity of Christ, Jews see the worship of Jesus as anthropolatry and so finally not properly monotheist and perhaps even pagan. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 566) </b>To soften the judgement, Lapide turns to Saadia, the ninth-century Gaon of Baghdad, who viewed Trinitarianism as distorted monotheism but not idolatry. Saadia saw the Trinity as ‘the hypostatization of the three divine attributes of essence, life, and omniscience’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 34), as was standard for his day. Although this deviates from the Jewish doctrine of God, Christians should not be considered idolaters but ‘genuine, if also odd monotheists’ (ibid.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, wanting to reach out to his Christian interlocutor as far as possible, Lapide concludes his essay by noting the few instances of Jewish conversation about God that resonate with some Trinitarian expressions. He refers to remarks of Karl Rahner and Rabbi Zalman Shneur of Ladi, the founder of the Lubavitcher dynasty, one of the pillars of modern Hasidism. Rahner, Lapide writes, says that God meets us in three givens—as Creator, Redeemer, and ‘the Spirit whose Self gives us our yes to God’—and reciprocally that Rabbi Zalman writes that God ‘is the Knowing One, the One Known, and the Knowledge, All these three form in God an indivisible unity’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 37). This derives from medieval Jewish polemic as we have seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In conclusion, however, Lapide chastises Christians for a want of shyness in their over-boldness to specify God. Trinitarian speculation has obscured the  <i class="calibre4">Deus absconditus</i> by dragging God out of hiding. Trinitarianism inquires too deeply into ‘the inscrutable God of the Bible’ in order to fix him in writing (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 42). In an interesting rebuff to both Jewish and Christian rationalism, Judaism, Lapide says, remains content with the ambiguous apophatic bottom line, while Christianity's drive for certain knowledge has led it too far down the cataphatic path. In essence, he asks Christians to give up their renegade doctrine and return home to monotheism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Jürgen Moltmann</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While Lapide dips his toes in the beckoning dialogical waters, Moltmann dives in at their deepest point. He graciously concedes that the burden of truth lies with the Christians, for monotheism is the norm against which Trinitarianism must hold its own. To do that, he arrestingly turns not to Christian but to Jewish theologians. Abraham Joshua Heschel's doctrine of divine pathos, developed in his book  <i class="calibre4">The Prophets</i>, is Moltmann's starting point for exegeting the Trinity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heschel, Moltmann says, was the first to break free from the apathetic god of the philosophers by finding in the prophets God's  <i class="calibre4">shekhina</i> going into exile with his people and suffering there with them. Clinging to the presence of God among them in exile is certainly the balm and hope of Israel. Yet Moltmann goes further. The divine condescension implies a distinction within God. Not only that, but ‘God and Israel together await their redemption. Israel knows that it will be redeemed because God will indeed redeem God's Self Page 8 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p594"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> and thereby also God's people … The suffering of God is the  <i class="calibre4">means</i> by which Israel will be redeemed. God's Self is the “ransom” for Israel’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 50). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moltmann builds on Heschel's notion of divine pathos, elaborating the language of divine self-abasement through A. M. Goldberg and Peter Kuhn. More significantly, he draws on Rosenzweig, as Lapide also had, quoting him at length. The  <i class="calibre4">shekhina</i> ‘is  <b class="calibre3">(p. 567) </b>pictured as a dichotomy taking place in God himself. God himself separates himself from himself, he gives himself away to his people, he shares in their sufferings, sets forth with them into the agony of exile, joins their wanderings’. While some would argue that worship of Jesus necessitated Trinitarianism, Moltmann, having established the suffering of God through contemporary Jewish sources, argues that Trinitarianism is the consequence of the story of the crucified Christ. It is ‘the conceptual framework needed to understand the story of Jesus as the story of God. The doctrine of the Trinity is the theological short summary of the story of the passion of Christ’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 48). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heschel, Rosenzweig, and Gershom Scholem's testimony that the Jewish mystical tradition—marginal as it is—speaks to self-distinction within God, embolden Moltmann to plant his faith in the redemptive meaning of the cross of Christ in Jewish soil. It is a sea change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A Christian theologian grounded the Trinity in Jewish theology! Moltmann dwells on the spiritual power of divine self-giving. The cross is the lodestone for the suffering, not only of Israel, but, through it, the suffering of the world. By abandoning his Son, God ‘becomes the Redeemer of all the Godforsaken’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 54). Jesus handed himself to abandonment in the face of divine anger, unifying divine love and anger with his death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the God-forsakenness of the cross, the self-distinction of God (begun in God's going into exile with his people) ‘embraces here the love of God and its opposite, the anger of God; the grace of God and its opposite, the judgement of God’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 53). The pathos of God, known to Israel's prophets, gathers up all the lost and abandoned in the abandonment of Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moltmann concludes with a vision. ‘After two thousand years of deadly differences [between Jews and Christians], the more profound convergence may and must finally be brought out. In this, the distinctions are to be affirmed as steps along the path to the recognition of one another and along the even broader path of hope with one another’ (Lapide and Moltmann 1981: 56). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Ochs–Tracy Dialogue</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In September 2000, five liberal-leaning Jews published a declaration in the  <i class="calibre4">New York</i> <i class="calibre4">Times</i>, ‘Dabru Emet’ (Speak Truth). It claims that Jews and Christians worship the same God and seek authority from the same Old Testament/Tanah. It asserts that Christians can respect the Jewish claim to the land of Israel. It denies that Nazism was a Christian phenomenon. It claims that theological differences between Jews and Christians will be settled only in the eschaton, that a new relationship with Christians will not harm Judaism, Page 9 of 14</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 568) Peter Ochs</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ochs speaks to both traditional and theologically sceptical Jews, that Jewish thought must now both respect received tradition and respond to modern Jews who long ago lost faith in God and since the Shoah have lost faith in humanity (Frymer-Kensky 2000: 54). To this end, he wants to form a new generation of Jewish scholars who will view Christianity in Jewish terms. It is noteworthy that the goal is not to study Christianity on its own terms, but to use Jewish terms to interpret it so that it is not quite as alien as it otherwise might be. Jews have often been eager to have Christians understand them in their own (Jewish) terms because the Christian terms for understanding Judaism have been so dangerous for Jews. Yet Ochs's stance is admirable because it seeks to legitimate Christianity on Jewish theological terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin that work, Ochs exonerates Christianity from the category of idolatry because it meets the Noachide standards, even though Christian doctrines may be incomprehensible. He acknowledges that the Incarnation and the Trinity are unacceptable, incomprehensible, and simply wrong Jewishly speaking, but encourages his students not to walk away from dialogue. He finds Christian beliefs to overlap at points with Jewish ones and add to them for the sake of another tradition that has some similar roots. That Christian beliefs are incompatible with Jewish ones, they retain recognizable elements from Jewish tradition that could be legitimate for Christians (Frymer-Kensky 2000: 60). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although this is but an essay, it is to this writer's knowledge the first Jewish attempt since Franz Rosenzweig's in the early 1920s to legitimate Christianity theologically. The American experience has been positive for Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">David Tracy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">David Tracy's response is short and pithy. He aligns himself with anti-supersessionist readings of Judaism. He begins by examining the term ‘monotheism’, seeking a ‘radical monotheism’ that grounds Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It claims one God, creator and sustainer of all reality, who has person-like characteristics, is related to history and nature, is transcendent to and immanent in all reality, and is self-disclosive so that in keeping with classic western Christianity the believer's goal is to know the self-disclosing God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last point sets the stage, for the rest of the article departs from Jewish and Islamic monotheism because Judaism and Islam claim that God revealed written text, not himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Christians, God self-discloses in the narratives of Israel and Jesus Christ, made available in the sacred narratives, doctrines, and liturgy of the church. YHWH funds knowledge of God as Father-Son-Holy Spirit (Frymer-Kensky 2000: 81). </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p596"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> Eschewing classic supersessionist Christian typology that empties the original scriptural </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘type’ of meaning and locates it in the ‘anti-type’, Christ, Tracy admits that God authentically self-discloses in the ‘pre-passion actions of YHVH in ancient Israel’ as well (Frymer-Kensky 2000: 81). He seeks to dissociate himself from Christianity's deep  <b class="calibre3">(p. 569) </b>marcionite inclination while reaffirming the singularly Johannine view that God is love known through the narratives of Israel and Jesus. Tracy grounds the radically relational Trinitarian God in the radically monotheist identity of YHWH. Tracy listens, reflects, and enters the dialogical lists at their most challenging point: the doctrine of the Trinity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">4. </b> <b class="calibre3">Conclusions</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This consideration of Jewish-Christian theological encounters around the doctrine of God suggests the following. (1) Divisive issues were clear early on. (2) It was not until Islamic scholasticism informed Jewish and Christian philosophical discourse that the ‘Trinity’—in the technical sense that Christians discuss the doctrine of God—became the central point of disagreement. (3) The Christian evangelistic motive discouraged Jews from engaging Christians all along the line. (4) Limited access to the doctrinal nuances of the other side has shaped the conversation over time. (5) The modern notion of dialogue sets a new path for Jewish-Christian encounter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(1)</b> Divisive issues were clear early on. The terms of the perennial disagreement between Jews and Christians on the doctrine of God were set by the mid second century. The presenting problem was whether Jesus was the messiah adumbrated in some scripture passages. The debate happening in the Fourth Gospel endured over time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind the messianic claim lay the question of what/who a messiah is. Jews and Christians agreed that the messiah would be sent by God but construed both the office and the identity of its holder quite differently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews never considered that the messiah would be other than a politically astute individual able to rescue Israel from political danger. Christians, by contrast, slowly groped toward the idea that the messiah was divine and that redemption was from ubiquitous and perennial spiritual, not imminent socio-political, problems. This was the breaking point. Most Jews refused Christianity because they could fathom neither a suprahuman messiah nor a pervasive spiritual need for spiritual salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needing immediate social and political relief, Israel had not been redeemed by Jesus from Roman occupation and that sufficed to disqualify him from messiahship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(2)</b> It was not until Islamic scholasticism informed Jewish and Christian discourse that the ‘Trinity’—in the technical sense that Christians discuss the doctrine of God—</p>
<p class="calibre1">became the central point of disagreement. Islamic rationalism gave Jews and Christians dialectical debate formats. Here, both sides engaged in formal polemics against the other on the issues of divine unity, multiplicity, and their  <b class="calibre3">(p. 570) </b>possible recon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 11 of 14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p597"></a><b class="calibre3">The Doctrine of God in Jewish-Christian Dialogue</b> cilability. The debates were about what was later called the essential Trinity, the notion that the multiplicity of God resides in the interiority of God. The soteriological mission of the incarnate Christ and the sending of the Holy Spirit beyond the purview of the Old Testament led to the notion of the economic Trinity that Jewish-Christian encounter could not navigate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(3)</b> Evangelistic pressure discouraged Jews from engaging Christians all along the line. David Tracy mentions the ‘longed-for dialogue between Christian and Jewish thinkers’ (Frymer-Kensky 2000: 77). It is a longing that only Christians could have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews often dreaded what modern dialogically persuaded Christians long for. In Christendom, Jews feared that Judaism could be lost. In the Middle Ages, Jews determined to defend the existence of Judaism were forced to combat Christian evangelizing, especially when it was state sponsored. The institutional memory of state-sponsored disabilities has discouraged Jews from engaging Christians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jewish apostates were an especially formidable adversary. Christians expected them to outwit or corner Jews. To this day, many Jews have resisted conversation with Christians fearing that the apostates among them would be called to incriminate themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(4)</b> Limited access to the doctrinal nuances of the other side has shaped the conversation over time. In Justin's day, the doctrine of the Trinity was unformulated, so Trypho could not have responded to it. Later, Jewish and Christian scholars often had only indirect access to one another's beliefs so that over time the conversation has been uneven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Advocates of both sides have been untrained in the nuances of the other's position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews, for example, have been attracted to the misled argument that the divine attributes are the basis of Trinitarianism. As recently as 2001, David Blumenthal argued that, based on the theory of divine attributes, there is no reason for Christians to claim only three divine Persons and not more. Since Cabalism claims ten attributes of the divine nature, why should Christians stop at three (Blumenthal 2001)? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(5)</b> The modern notion of dialogue that eschews the evangelistic motive sets a new path for Jewish-Christian encounter. This constraint considerably limits the number of appropriate interlocutors, however, since Jews do not welcome evangelists. In the materials considered here, Lapide and Ochs venture out into the fresh water, trusting that Moltmann and Tracy are among the new breed of Christians who seek mutual acceptance rather than the conversion of the Jews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modernity brought the notion of toleration. At first, this meant rescinding civic and economic liabilities for standing outside state-sponsored religion. Later modernity moved beyond toleration to consider pluralism. While Jews embraced pluralism, Christians are challenged by it. Currently, Jewish-Christian dialogue is the domain of advocates of pluralism on both sides of the aisle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">(p. 571) </b>The doctrine of God decisively divides Christians and Jews. Dialogue respects the self-definition of both communities while inviting them to come as near to one another as possible within the constraints of their respective theological boundaries. It may be the province of only a few, but they are charting new ground. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This article examines the relevance of the doctrine of the Trinity for interreligious dialogues. It shows how recent reflection on the religions has been impoverished when the Trinity is not the guiding light and describes some helpful Trinitarian approaches to the religions. It raises concerns about the approaches of Karl Rahner, Jacques Dupuis, and Raimundo Panikkar to the Trinity and non-Christian religions and argues for explicitly Trinitarian and Christological approaches to these religions in terms of  <i class="calibre4">praeparatio evangelica</i>,  <i class="calibre4">semina Verbi</i>, and  <i class="calibre4">vestigia Trinitatis</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keywords: interreligious dialogues, Trinity, Karl Rahner, Jacques Dupuis, Raimundo Panikkar, praeparatio evangelica, semina Verbi, vestigia Trinitatis <b class="calibre3">Introduction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctrine of the Trinity performs at least two important tasks. It allows us to name God as revealed in Jesus Christ so that our God-talk can refer analogically to the divine mystery. This mystery is disclosed in creation, in the history of Israel's covenant, and through its fulfilment (not abrogation) in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit. Second, faith in the Trinity structures and is structured by the liturgy of the Church, and is enacted such that the ‘real presence’ of the divine Trinity is present in the eucharist. The Church is shaped by the Trinity if the Church is, as Paul calls it, the ‘body of Christ’ (Acts 9:1, 4; and see also Eph. 1:22–3; 4:4; 1 Cor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">12:6). The threefold name in the baptismal formula (Matt. 28:19) marks a person's dying and rising again into the new  <i class="calibre4">ecclesia</i>. These Trinitarian markers are important in Christian reflection on the religious life of humankind if the question about that religious life is a question about God's actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reflection on the world religions is often divided into two specific areas. First, there is a general ‘theology of religions’. Here various theological questions are explored such as: What if any is the mode of revelation outside Jesus Christ? How is that revelation, if there Page 1 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p601"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> is such, related to salvation? Does the Spirit and does the Son act within the world religions? If so, how is this to be understood? Is the kingdom of God operative outside the visible boundaries of the Church? Is the Trinity and the Church necessary for salvation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are just some of the questions and their Trinitarian nature is apparent. The second field concerns specific questions related to particular engagements, a ‘theology with religions’, when for example Christianity meets Hinduism in the nineteenth century in India, or when Hindus ask to buy a redundant church in Birmingham, UK, or in the question, does the Muslim doctrine of God as taught by Al Ghazali correspond to  <b class="calibre3">(p. 574) </b>the Christian doctrine of the one God taught by Thomas Aquinas? In so much as the Trinity is an ecclesial doctrine, the two areas cannot be so easily separated, but the distinction is heuristically helpful. I will mainly focus on the first area in this chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In what follows I want to develop an argument in three sections. First, I want to indicate how recent reflection on the religions has been impoverished when the Trinity is not the guiding light. I also want to suggest that the Trinity actually helps secure the goals of many of these theologians who try to avoid Trinitarian reflection. Second, I want to briefly examine some helpful Trinitarian approaches to the religions, and note their strengths and weaknesses. Third, I want to constructively develop the positive elements from these two preparatory sections to indicate the importance of the Trinity for interreligious dialogues. I write as a Roman Catholic theologian in an ecumenical spirit who is engaged in interreligious dialogues. In both instances, ecumenism and interreligious dialogues, the specificity of my theological starting point is not meant as a barrier, but an invitation to engage in conversations and friendship, teaching and learning, and a deeper discovery of God's gifts to humankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Avoiding the Trinity? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In theology of religions there have been many trajectories that have seen the Trinity as a problem rather than as a resource and starting point. For some, Karl Barth's Trinitarian emphasis exemplifies the problems. The argument against Barth (summarized) is that if God is Trinity and the Trinity is God, then other religions can never amount to anything other than idolatry or human grasping, for none proclaim Father, Son, and Spirit. Barth's Christocentric focus is also deemed problematic as it means that there can be no authentic ‘faith’ outside of those who expressly confess Jesus Christ as Lord. Barth is seen to close down interreligious dialogues rather than opening them up. In reaction to this perceived ‘closed’ circle (along with various other factors such as modernity's impact upon theology, a complex mission history whose contours sometimes overlap too closely with an arrogant European colonialism) non-Trinitarian theologies have been developed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Schematically speaking, they either emphasize the ‘Father’, the ‘Spirit’, or ‘the kingdom’, but not in a Trinitarian balance. Usually they employ a low Christology whereby Jesus is seen as different in degree and is not proclaimed as the unique God-Man. I refer readers to a more detailed outline and critique of such thinkers in their complex diversity (D’Costa 2010). Let me put a little flesh on these bones. Such summaries fail to do justice to careful reflection by the authors mentioned. I would never question their noble inten</p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 2 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p602"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> tions of developing good interreligious relations, although I shall be arguing that their intentions are better met within a Trinitarian orientation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John Hick's vast corpus exemplifies two of these four trajectories—the Father and the kingdom. During his early period Hick stressed the ‘God of love’ (the ‘Father’) at the centre of the ‘universe of faiths’ (Hick 1977: 168–80). Hick argued that a loving God would not consign the majority of humankind to perdition just because they had never  <b class="calibre3">(p. 575)</b> heard about Christianity. He also argued that the doctrine of the Incarnation should be understood ‘mythically’, not ontologically, expressing the force of poetry and deep existential commitment. This meant that the Buddha, Muhammad, the Dao and other </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘mediators’ (persons or key texts) could all draw people to the loving God, and thus to salvation, just as Jesus did for Christians. How might we know this? Through their fruits: through the reality of the ‘kingdom of God’ in actions of love, justice, compassion, and kindness. Liberation-orientated theologians like Aloysius Pieris and Paul Knitter made the </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘kingdom’ the criterion for discerning God's activity in all religions and, like Hick, were able to discern equally salvific traditions within more than one religion (for full bibliographical references for all authors mentioned here and subsequently, see D’Costa 2010). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knitter and Pieris found this kingdom-centredness especially helpful in dealing with non-theistic Buddhism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emphasis on the Father alone led to important questions: What was the basis for such a normative doctrine of a loving God? Did the different religions yield the same ‘God of love’? Was such a thin narration of the ‘God of love’ acceptable to any particular religion in its attempt to privilege no one religion? Could this doctrine commend itself to orthodox Trinitarian belief? And what of religions that held a normative non-theistic ‘divine’ like Buddhism? Hick eventually had to mythologize ‘God’ as he had the ‘Son’ (as well as other religions’ normative truths) to try to be fair to all religions. The emphasis on the kingdom also generated complex questions: Could the kingdom be detached from the person of Jesus? Could it be detached from the Church? And was it not ultimately just a privileging of certain values, possibly those exalted by liberal moderns, when detached from the person of Christ? (On this latter see especially Milbank 1990.) I contend that the universal fatherhood of God, who loves all peoples, and the joyful acknowledgement of traces of the kingdom outside the visible boundaries of the Church (and its all too shady presence within the history of the Church) are both quite in keeping with orthodox Trinitarian theology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, Trinitarian theology better grounds such claims in a robust Christian manner, without having the negative impact upon other religions usually attributed to it—see below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pneumatological emphasis has arisen in part because it seems to avoid what has been called the ‘Christological impasse’ which is the apparent roadblock upon the recognition of other revelations erected by the unique status given to the Son. Writers like Stanley Samartha, George Khodr, and Amos Yong want to argue that the Spirit is present in other religions and, employing a certain reading of Irenaeus, urge that we should see God's works being carried out by both hands: the Son  <i class="calibre4">and</i> the Spirit. The Barthian subordination of the Spirit to the Son is thereby overturned and the great riches and depths Page 3 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p603"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> found in other persons and their religion can be joyfully acknowledged. Questions arise here as to whether the doctrine of perichoresis and the unity of the ‘persons’ is thus compromised; whether the Spirit can be biblically other than the Spirit of the Son; and whether this neglect of Christology universalizes the Spirit in a rather gnostic fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most problematic in all these three trajectories is the minimization of the atoning value of Christ's death and the transformation of the human condition through his resurrection and ascension. The heart of Christian truth and the universal mission it  <b class="calibre3">(p. 576) </b>generates is minimized by these non-Trinitarian theologians. If all religions were to drop their most fundamental unique insights into the nature of reality so as not to cause offence to those who had different views, interreligious dialogue would cease! Is such a loss of salt necessary for the attainment of the common good, or rather, does it actually undermine the common good by removing the unique Christian contribution? I think the latter is most likely. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Return of the Trinity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The two most influential Trinitarian theologians of the modern period are arguably the Protestant Karl Barth (1886–1968) and the Catholic Karl Rahner (1904–84). Barth attended to the question of the religions twice and has been deeply misunderstood in part because of the English translation of his first famous essay that was translated ‘The Revelation of God as the Abolition [ <i class="calibre4">Aufhebung</i>] of Religions’ (Barth 1970: §17).  <i class="calibre4">Aufhebung</i> might equally be translated as ‘lifting up’ or ‘sublation’. When Hegel uses the term  <i class="calibre4">Aufhebung</i>, he emphasizes both a taking up of a concept and its being rendered anew in this process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This I think is more akin to what Barth was implying in this essay: anything worthwhile in a religion was taken up and transformed in the light of Christ, for without Christ it is always incomplete. The early Barth was concerned to establish that revelation is Trinitarian and salvific. To use the term ‘revelation’ of anything else dangerously invited idolatry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barth's battle against National Socialism is an important back-drop, although his horror of natural theology cannot be minimized. Barth is keen to establish the uniqueness of Christian revelation in its particular narrative form of Israel's covenant and the coming of Jesus Christ. Natural theology to him seemed to allow fallen humans access to God through corrupt human power. The Roman Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar argued that this misunderstood the doctrine of  <i class="calibre4">analogia entis</i> that might otherwise free the real potential of Barth's Trinitarian orientation (Balthasar 1952). The  <i class="calibre4">analogia entis</i> always needs interpretation through the  <i class="calibre4">analogia fidei</i>. To interpret Barth evenly, one should recall he was an admirer of socialism and this partial positive appreciation of some </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘alien’ cultural elements emerges in his writings on secular culture (‘parables’ in secular culture) and on the religions (their many ‘lights’) (Barth 2003: §69). Barth acknowledges that there are prophetic, truthful, and even revelatory ‘lights’ to be found outside Christianity, ‘lights’ which are reflections of the ‘Light’, Jesus Christ. Balthasar's criticism may have helped with this shift and Barth acknowledged Balthasar's work as most insightful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Page 4 of 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p604"></a><b class="calibre3">The Trinity in Interreligious Dialogues</b> Barth's immense strength was his firm rooting of God as Trinity and a searching and searing critique of culture and religions, including Christianity, from this vantage-point. His relentless concern to concentrate God-language in Trinitarian narrative is a font for post-liberal theology and philosophical forms of Reformation theology. Catholics such as Balthasar also affirmed this precious insight. Barth's weakness is his naturalizing of the <i class="calibre4">analogia entis</i> in a way that Balthasar showed was not required by a fully Trinitarian <b class="calibre3">(p. 577) </b>orientation. The human mind, even while fallen, was still capable of displaying what Augustine called ‘vestiges’ of the Trinity in thinking, feeling, and willing. Medievals developed this idea further, with Bonaventure distinguishing between vestiges, images, and likenesses of the Trinity. At stake is fallen nature's ability to still point to the divine in however defective and inadequate a manner. As Balthasar argued, the  <i class="calibre4">analogia entis</i> must always be viewed through the  <i class="calibre4">analogia fidei</i> to see the profound orientation of all creation towards the living God. Hence, the way non-Christians view these actions does not necessarily thwart the way in which God is able to work for the restoration of creation: Cyrus, the non-Israelite, facilitates God's grace for Israel. The same holds true of Christians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, it is worth noting that Barth's attitude to the religions has to be read alongside his universalism. He is often characterized as a ‘restrictive exclusivist’ (salvation only comes through explicit faith and confession in Jesus Christ), but in practice his universalism undercuts an alleged necessary implication of restrictivist exclusivism: that non-Christians are damned. This move in Barth is based on his redefining the Reformed tradition of double predestination through a reading of predestination exclusively in the person of Christ. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rahner's theology has been hugely influential in Catholic circles. In  <i class="calibre4">Spirit in the World</i> (English translation 1968) Rahner argued that the Spirit was present to all humans  <i class="calibre4">qua</i> humans, such that all nature was always graced nature with an orientation to God. This unthematized (non-explicit) relation to God was fully and most explicitly thematized in the God-Man, Jesus Christ. In history, it is through this revelation that we discover the reality of graced nature, which until then is never properly known. Nevertheless, all history affords the possibility of a person saying yes to the teleological drive of his/her own graced nature in acts of love, trust, and hope—without explicit confrontation with the revelation of Christ. A person can say no to unthematized grace in acts of despair, hatred, and evil, but there is a profound contradiction involved in sin's use of transcendental freedom to foreclose its own freedom. The outcome of Rahner's  <i class="calibre4">Spirit in the World</i> is that all humans <i class="calibre4">qua</i> humans are capable of finding redemption through the Spirit in their concrete actions that teleologically orient them to Christ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Jesus exemplified the fullness of this ‘yes’ of Man to God and God to Man, this ‘yes’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">is to be found in fragmentary form everywhere, including the religions—amidst a ‘no’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rahner thus coined the terms ‘anonymous Christian’ and ‘anonymous Christianity’, reflecting the Christological orientation of all grace in terms of final, not efficient, causality. </p>
