				<p class="Heading-A-after" id="toc_marker-4-1"><span class="bold">What is this book?</span></p>
				<p class="text">What is this book? It is an overview of Christian doctrine, aimed at undergraduates. It is not, however, a survey of all the major options in the interpretation of Christian doctrine, nor is it a detailed account of the history of those doctrines. It is, rather, my attempt to <span class="italic">make sense</span> of Christian doctrine – to provide one way of seeing how it all hangs together, and what it might mean. It is my extended suggestion for the sense that might be made of the life of Christian faith in the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, what is this book? It is my attempt to help students, and other readers, <span class="italic">think through</span> Christian doctrine. Writing it has involved such a process of thinking through for me, and I have tried to write in such a way as to get my readers thinking too. I very much want my readers to see <span class="italic">why</span> it might make sense to say the things that Christian doctrine says, and to see <span class="italic">what it might mean</span> to say those things. It is a long book, I know, but that’s because I have tried to put in as many as possible of the ideas, images and analogies that help me think these things through. I hope my way of thinking is not so eccentric as to make them useless for everybody else.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, what is this book? It is an extended exploration of one way of telling the Christian story. I think Christians can make sense of themselves as creatures being drawn to share or participate in the life of their Creator. In Part 1, I focus on the life of God, and the way in which it is opened up for God’s creatures. In Part 2, I focus on the life of the world, and the way in which it is drawn into participation in God’s life. Part 1 looks at the life of God as Trinity, and at the incarnation of the Son and the sending of the Spirit. Part 2 looks at creation, providence and eschatology, at suffering and sin, and at the Church. Part 2 also finishes with two chapters that look at the Bible and at the sources for theology. I have put those chapters at the end deliberately, because my way of making sense of the nature and sources of theology is too tangled up with my way of making sense of Christian doctrine to be presented on its own at the beginning.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-4-2"><span class="bold">Where does this book come from?</span></p>
				<p class="text">Where does this book come from? I have for some years now been teaching one year of a two-year Certificate in Theology to evening class students in Exeter. I inherited a syllabus, and lots of advice, from others who had taught the class before me – most recently, Tim Gorringe and Jeremy Law – and have slowly tried to make that course my own. I also, a few years back, created an online version of that course, with the help of my colleagues Susan Graham, Jim Little and Stephen Dawes. It is that online version that has provided the basis of this book – though the job of turning it into a book has taken longer, and been more complicated, than I had imagined at the start. The online origins still show, I suspect, in the number of weblinks that I provide. I owe a great deal to the colleagues I have mentioned, who helped me learn how to teach the evening classes, or helped me learn how to put material together engagingly for the online course. Even more than to them, though, I owe a debt of gratitude to my students, who have been very good at letting me know when I’m talking rubbish, or when I am losing them in unnecessary complications, or when I am pushing one of my metaphors just a little bit too far. Some of those students, if they look carefully, might discover themselves, peering round corners in this book; all of them have shaped it for the better.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I should also say that I owe a lot to the American theologian Daniel Migliore. We have never met, and I don’t suppose he’s ever heard of me, but I’ve used his book <span class="italic">Faith Seeking Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Theology</span> (now in its second edition – Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2004) as the main textbook in those evening classes for a few years now – so he has had quite an influence on the way that I present things, an influence that is probably acknowledged inadequately in my footnotes.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Where does this book come from? It comes in large part from the people who have taught me to do theology in the way that I do it. If you look carefully at these pages, you might be able to see the fingerprints of my parents, Tony and Patricia Higton, who always want to know <span class="italic">why</span> I as a theologian say the things that I do, and how those things relate to the Bible; of my teacher David Ford, who showed me what being a theologian involved, and who introduced me to the way that theological topics ramify and interconnect and spread in all sorts of unexpected ways; of the American theologian Hans Frei who was the subject of my doctoral work, and whose elusive but generative writings have coloured my whole theological vision; and of Rowan Williams, about whose theology I wrote a short book while teaching the course that became this book, and who therefore (as you will see) gets quoted rather a lot here. I should at this point confess to some self-plagiarism as well: anyone who has read my <span class="italic">Difficult Gospel: The Theology of Rowan Williams</span> (London: SCM Press, 2004) will find that several passages from it appear, reworked, in this book.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Where does this book come from? From conversations with friends – particularly late at night in the bar at Society for the Study of Theology conferences. I can remember, and am grateful for, conversations on topics that appear in this book with Nick Adams, Jon Cooley, Tim Gorringe, David Hewlett, Steve Holmes, David Horrell, Karen Kilby, Morwenna Ludlow, John McDowell, David Moss, Rachel Muers, Paul Murray, Chad Pecknold, Ben Quash, David Rhymer, Chris Southgate, Francesca Stavrakopoulou, Susannah Ticciati, Paul Wignall and Mark Wynn. On every topic that appears in this book, at least one of these friends knows much more than I do. To my way of thinking, that means that they are the ones who should be blamed for anything I’ve misunderstood or distorted, as well as thanked for anything I’ve got right.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Where does this book come from? From SCM Press, who commissioned it, and who have been very, very kind about the five deadlines that I missed, and the word limit that I trebled. Many thanks to Barbara Laing, Mary Matthews and Christine Smith for their patience and trust. They also let me publish a version of Chapter 10 on its own as <span class="italic">Deliver Us: Exploring the Problem of Evil</span>, Church Times Study Guides (London: SCM Press, 2007).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Where does this book come from? Above all, from an author who is surrounded and supported by his family. I am deeply thankful to my wife Hester – and only hope that I manage to support her in her work<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-1" id="footnote-169-1-backlink">1</a></span> even half as much as she supports me in mine – and to my two children, Bridget and Tom, currently aged 4 and 2, who have interrupted my work on this book, scribbled on it, dribbled on it, and kept me from thinking that it is the most important thing that I do. They have also, quite unintentionally, made me think differently about all sorts of theological topics, and so appear in unexpected places all over these pages. I dedicated <span class="italic">Difficult Gospel</span> to Bridget, so this book is dedicated to Tom – because I want to, and because life with him is great.</p>
