				<p class="text">This first chapter is designed to steer you away from one set of expectations that you might have for this book as a whole, and towards another that I think might help you to make better sense of it. I want to distract you from the treacherous charms of the idea that theology is made up of abstract theories about God, and try to interest you instead in the suggestion that it has to do with individuals and communities making practical sense of their lives in relation to God.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">note that the word ‘theology’ means something like ‘rational discourse about God’;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">acknowledge that ‘rationality’ may not be an obvious aim when the subject one is discussing is God;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest nevertheless that, at its most basic, the word ‘rationality’ refers to the ways in which people make sense of their lives as they live them, and test the sense that they have made;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that communities as well as individuals engage in these ways of making sense of themselves and testing that sense;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that the sense that Christian communities have made of themselves is dominated by the claim that they have been laid hold of by God in Jesus of Nazareth; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">propose some ways in which the study of theology as an academic discipline might relate to this sort of ordinary Christian sense-making.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Preparation</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Ask yourself what you think ‘rational’ means. When, if at all, do you think you most clearly display ‘rationality’ in your life? Does such rationality have anything to do with faith?</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Ask yourself why you are studying theology, and what you hope the study will do to you or for you. Why are you reading this book in particular? If you have any kind of Christian faith yourself, how does this study relate to it? If you do not, what rationale do you have for studying specifically <span class="italic">Christian</span> doctrine?</li>

				<p class="text">In the 1980s, British Telecom commissioned a series of television adverts starring Maureen Lipman. In one, her grandson tells her on the phone that he has failed his exams, passing only Sociology. Lipman replies, ‘An ology? He gets an ology and he says he’s failed. You get an ology, you’re a scientist!’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-2" id="footnote-169-2-backlink">2</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">She’s right, in a way: the ending ‘-logy’ comes from the Greek word <span class="italic">logos</span>, and in this kind of context (the context of academic study and exam results) it does mean something like ‘ordered discussion’ or ‘rational discourse’ – something like ‘science’, if one is speaking broadly.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-3" id="footnote-169-3-backlink">3</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Combine that ‘-logy’ ending with <span class="italic">theos, </span>the Greek word for ‘God’, however, and you get ‘<span class="italic">theo</span>logy’ – that is, Godology. Theology is rational discourse about God or even the <span class="italic">science </span>of God – and even if one is prepared to accept sociology as a science, one might balk at this.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-4" id="footnote-169-4-backlink">4</a></span> One might wonder whether ‘God’ and ‘rational discourse’ can appropriately be squeezed together in the confines of a single word. It is not a word, after all, that you will find in the Bible – or at least, not quite. It is true that some manuscripts of the book of Revelation have the heading <span class="italic">Apokalupsis ioannou tou theologou</span>, ‘the Revelation of John the <span class="italic">theologian</span>’, but John deserves no congratulations from Maureen Lipman, because the -<span class="italic">logos</span> ending in his case means something very different, as a sixth-century inscription from Asia Minor explains. It praises John as the beloved disciple who reclined on God’s breast, and who was therefore given</p>
				<p class="quotes">the ineffable words through which he has shown us his divine and unfathomable inspiration, by reason of which he was fittingly called son of thunder – and <span class="italic">theologian.</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-5" id="footnote-169-5-backlink">5</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">John is a ‘theologian’ (and the word creeps into the very edges of the Bible) not because he has managed to master the divine subject matter and set it out in rational order, but because he has himself been mastered by God, overwhelmed and disordered, and entrusted with inspired utterances or oracles from God – with <span class="italic">logoi</span> from <span class="italic">theos</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-6" id="footnote-169-6-backlink">6</a></span> The writer of Revelation is about as far from the popular culture image of the scientist or the –ologist, as one could get: no Bunsen burner and test tube, no clipboard and questionnaire, no study desk and bookshelves. He is the seer on Patmos, caught up ‘in the Spirit’, hearing a voice like a trumpet, seeing a vision of God, and falling on his face as though dead (Revelation 1.9–10, 17).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Perhaps, then, the word ‘theology’ is an oxymoron, and the kind of studious activity it normally names is illegitimate? If knowing God is a matter of personal encounter, or of overwhelming involvement, or even of inspired utterances and visions, perhaps rational investigation is simply an irrelevance – a category mistake, like trying to measure the height of love? Or, worse, perhaps it is a way of trying to <span class="italic">avoid</span> encounter and involvement with God by holding God’s utterance at arm’s length, objectifying and analysing it so as not to have to listen to the challenge it issues?<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-7" id="footnote-169-7-backlink">7</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Those are serious questions, and I don’t raise them simply in order to dismiss them. I <span class="italic">do</span> think that there is<span class="italic"> </span>something uncomfortable about the word ‘theology’, almost as if two magnets were being pushed together the wrong way round, and I <span class="italic">do not </span>think one should quash too easily the rumour that intellectual mastery is an inappropriate goal to pursue if one’s subject matter is God. My task in this chapter (and in the two that follow) is not to <span class="italic">solve</span> these questions, but to sidle around them, suggesting that there might be forms of ‘rational discourse about God’ that do not get quite so big for their boots.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Between Athens and Jerusalem</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In the second century after Christ, the North African theologian Tertullian wrote:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The Lord chose the foolish things of the earth (1 Corinthians 1.27) to confound philosophy. Philosophy is the stuff of worldly wisdom, which boldly asserts itself to be the interpreter of the nature and activity of God. But what is there in common between Athens and Jerusalem, between the Academy and the church? Our system of beliefs comes from the Porch of Solomon’s Temple, who himself taught that it was necessary to seek God in the simplicity of our hearts. We have no need to be <span class="italic">curious</span> about Jesus Christ, or to be <span class="italic">inquisitive</span> about the Gospel; when we believe, we don’t desire to believe anything more.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-8" id="footnote-169-8-backlink">8</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Tertullian was worried that false teachers were corrupting the beliefs and practices of his church, and that their teachings were born from a surfeit of philosophy – the pagan philosophy that he associated first and foremost with Athens, the city of Plato and Aristotle. Christian faith, he said, has little to do with the ambitious attempts of the philosophers to sort the world out for themselves. It is based on a simple, humble acceptance of the faith delivered in God’s city of Jerusalem – not in any academy of philosophers, but in the Temple. What has Athens of the philosophers got to do with Jerusalem of the simple faithful? Why, if one has received faith from God, would one need to corrupt it by attempting to sort it out according to one’s intellectual curiosity?<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-9" id="footnote-169-9-backlink">9</a></span></p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB">The meanings of rationality</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">When people ask whether theology is rational, it is often quite difficult to work out what they mean, because the word ‘rational’ can mean a whole variety of different things.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">They might be asking whether theological claims have any place now that everyone (supposedly) knows that the natural world, structured by knowable laws of cause and effect, is all that there is.</li>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">They might even be asking whether theological claims can be deduced logically from indubitable starting points, rather like mathematical theorems.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-11" id="footnote-169-11-backlink">11</a></span></li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">They might be asking whether theological claims fit in with the ideas of some philosophical movement that they take as their guide to thinking about reality – existentialism, perhaps, or Marxism, or post-structuralism.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">They might be asking whether theological ideas fit together into a comprehensive and coherent worldview, forming an interlocking system of ideas that can order one’s understanding of anything and everything.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">They might simply be asking whether theological claims can be put forward in clear and consistent ways, avoiding ambiguity and contradiction.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">They might be asking whether theologians develop their ideas honestly and responsibly, in ways that are genuinely responsive to criticism and attentive to detail.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-12" id="footnote-169-12-backlink">12</a></span></li>
				</ol>
				<p class="text-line-above">As you will see, when I talk about ‘rationality’ in this chapter, I will be hovering closer to the end of this list than to the beginning.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-6-4">Exercise</p>
				<p class="text">Search online for reviews of Richard Dawkins’s rationalist attack on religion, <span class="italic">The God Delusion</span> (London: Bantam, 2006) – and try teasing apart the different meanings of ‘rational’ employed by him, his supporters and his detractors.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">I want to suggest two examples of rationality at work that might persuade you that it need not be kept in the fridge. For both of them, ‘rationality’ has something to do with an interplay between creative and critical impulses. On the one hand, there is the creative impulse that, faced with an unruly mess of experience or information, tries to develop some coherent way of talking about it all, some way of <span class="italic">making sense</span> of it all. On the other hand, there is the critical impulse that looks out for the ways in which the unruly mess of experience or information wriggles out of one’s grasp, and calls into question the sense one has made. I think a good case can be made that this interplay is crucial in those homes of rational enquiry, the scientific laboratory and the academic library – but also that it can be found alive and well, living incognito among ordinary people, in houses and bars and fish and chip shops.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Imagine, first, that you were reading a Jane Austen novel, one that was new to you. And imagine that in the thirteenth chapter, after the arrival of a letter in which the hero’s intentions were unexpectedly clarified to the heroine, a horde of pirates were to descend from the coast, kidnap her and whisk her away to their sea-cave hideout. You would, I imagine, be surprised. And the <span class="italic">fact</span> that you were surprised would indicate that the most important constituents of rationality were at work.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You would be surprised because the horde of pirates ran against your expectations about the book. You would be surprised, that is, because in reading the book you had built up some kind of picture of what <span class="italic">goes</span> and what <span class="italic">does not go</span> in the world in which the story was taking place. Your surprise would be evidence that, as well as simply reading the events of the story as they happen, one after the other, you had (with some part of your mind) been stepping back and sketching in the broader landscape within which the story’s events were happening. That would have involved you developing at least rough expectations about the geographical setting (you would be surprised if an episode involved visiting a glacier, or an asteroid crater); it would have involved rough expectations about the temporal setting (you would be surprised if a rock star moved into the area – even if he did turn out to be a single man in possession of a good fortune); it would have involved more subtle expectations about the genre and the limitations of this kind of story (you would be surprised by the appearance of a ghost, or of the Spanish Inquisition).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is rationality in one of its raw forms: the mostly unacknowledged sketching in of expectations and predictions, which accompanies one’s reading of a story and allows one to be surprised, or pleased, or upset, or confused by the way the story goes. In fact, it is this kind of thinking that allows one to experience a story as <span class="italic">having </span>a plot, as <span class="italic">having</span> characters and as <span class="italic">having</span> a setting: if one had no such scaffolding of expectations and understandings, one would experience the book simply as a tangled spaghetti of unconnected sentences.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This process of making sense is ongoing and dynamic. As one carries on reading, one’s half-hidden theories and hypotheses are constantly being revised. Even if nothing so out of place as a pirate posse turns up, one will find plenty that upsets the pictures one has begun to sketch. One might, for instance, have started to paint a mental portrait of a central character as an arrogant and unfeeling boor, only to find the heroine receiving a letter that places his behaviour in a new light – and so finding that one is forced to revise one’s thinking (just as she is forced to revise hers). Part of the pleasure of reading the book is precisely that of having one’s expectations confounded, and part of the skill of the writer is in helping one to build up the misleading expectations in the first place, before knocking them down. (Try reading Dorothy L. Sayers’s <span class="italic">Five Red Herrings</span> if you want a classic and, as the title suggests, very deliberate example of such misdirection.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-13" id="footnote-169-13-backlink">13</a></span>) Even when one comes back and reads the same book a second or third time, one is likely to find that some of one’s picture of its story, its world and its characters is challenged, and that one sees things at least slightly differently. (Another good example is Charles Palliser’s <span class="italic">The Quincunx</span> – a book whose very last sentence sends one back to reread the whole story again with new eyes.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-14" id="footnote-169-14-backlink">14</a></span>)</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">There is nothing really new going on when some people choose to put into words their expectations and predictions (or their sense of how the book challenges existing claims and theories) and to publish them in academic and literary journals.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-15" id="footnote-169-15-backlink">15</a></span> Such academic attempts at the rational investigation of the novel are nothing but more formal and explicit versions of the raw, ordinary rationality that we all use all the time when we are reading.</p>

								<p class="text">Try watching the first episode of a new television drama serial, and then discussing with friends how you have started sketching out the setting for this story.

							</td>

				</table>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">As a second example, consider <span class="italic">gossip</span>. I don’t mean here the kind that spreads maliciously embroidered stories about some unfortunate neighbour. I mean our ongoing, friendly and informal chatter about the lives and doings of family, friends and colleagues – the kind of chatter that constantly hazards <span class="italic">interpretations</span> of the people around us and plays around with those interpretations. ‘Well, I think he shouts at her because he’s a bit insecure’, ‘Oh, she goes for quiet men, haven’t you noticed, they’re all the same; it’s all of a piece with the way she treats her secretary’, or ‘Do you know, I had him completely wrong; I thought he was rude, but all along he was just being shy’ – and so on: constant attempts to find reasons for what people say and do; constant attempts to build up pictures of how people work; constant attempts to revise those pictures when people turn out not quite to fit into them. That too is raw rationality at work.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If you listen carefully to the kind of friendly gossip I’m talking about, you might be amazed at how supple and sophisticated it can be. Perfectly ordinary people turn out to be capable of deploying complex, multilayered, psychologically acute, detailed and responsive pictures of their friends, colleagues and relations. Perfectly ordinary people, we might say, turn out to be sophisticated <span class="italic">theorists</span> of their friends and colleagues.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-16" id="footnote-169-16-backlink">16</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Now, I know this is a somewhat provocative example. One of the problems with gossip is that we are often better at the building up of initial pictures of how people work than at revising them when new facts come our way. Gossip can all too easily give prominence to one-dimensional caricatures of the people we don’t like, caricatures that then ‘stick’, however the person concerned acts. And part of the problem is that gossip is often carried on in such a way that the person gossiped about is the last one to hear how he or she is being described, and so the last person who can directly and explicitly challenge any unfairness in the portrait.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But that problem simply highlights the fact that being rational can’t simply mean being good at developing pictures of how people work, but must also mean being alive to the ways in which what is being talked about does not quite match those pictures. Rationality, if it is to be fully human, must be dynamic and ongoing; it involves both the building up of pictures <span class="italic">and </span>the willingness to have those pictures tested by what they purport to describe.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Rationality is sometimes presented as if it gets to work when one has shut the door on the mess and confusion of ordinary life, retreated into one’s study and cleared the desk of all that might be distracting. It is presented as working best with abstract and pure ideas, and as working towards saying something about ordinary life only slowly, awkwardly and unconvincingly – as in the popular culture image of the absent-minded professor who knows everything about time machines or ancient hieroglyphics, but nothing about doing up shoelaces or undoing bras.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-17" id="footnote-169-17-backlink">17</a></span> You might have begun this book with the assumption that academic theology was bound to involve that kind of rationality: dry, abstract, removed from ordinary life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That is not the picture of rationality I have in mind, however. Both the examples I have given (of the rationality involved in reading a novel and of the rationality involved in benign gossip) are intended to suggest something very different. Where is rationality to be found? The answer I am suggesting is, ‘All around us’. All around us we find two things combined. On the one hand, we find people <span class="italic">making sense</span> of their surroundings, of their friends, of the things that they read, seeing them not simply as collections of random characteristics, but as situations or people or stories that have some kind of consistency to them. On the other hand, we find people revising the sense that they have made, realizing that they have been mistaken, realizing that the picture they have built up doesn’t allow them to make sense of some new episode or fact or encounter, and so realizing that some new sense is needed. All around us we find the <span class="italic">making</span>, the <span class="italic">breaking</span> and the <span class="italic">remaking </span>of sense.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This making, breaking and remaking of sense <span class="italic">is</span> rationality. And to be <span class="italic">more</span> rational, if this is what rationality is, is to be more attentive, more careful about this making, breaking and remaking. To be more rational is to make sense in ways that are alive to a broader gamut of experience; it is to become more sensitive to all that calls the sense one has already made into question. To be more rational is to be more alive, more fully engaged. When reading a novel, for instance, being more rational might mean allowing one’s picture of the hero to become more alive to all the subtle signals that the story so far has given – to be, in one sense, more <span class="italic">impressionable</span>. And it will be to read with more readiness to have one’s picture challenged and redrawn as the story goes on, to read with more sensitivity to any little signals that might begin to tell us that all is not as it has seemed.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-18" id="footnote-169-18-backlink">18</a></span></p>

				<p class="text">In the remainder of this chapter, I am going to suggest three related ways in which Christian theology involves ‘making sense’. I am going to begin, in this section and the next two, by looking at some of the ways in which Christian <span class="italic">communities</span> have gone about making sense of themselves – and the place that ‘Christian doctrine’ has had in that sense-making. Then, in a section entitled ‘The meaning of life’ (pp. 21–24), I will turn to the ways in which an <span class="italic">individual</span> might go about making sense of his or her life, and the new possibilities for making such sense that are offered by Christian doctrine. And finally, in ‘Watching the world’ (pp. 24–26), I will turn to look briefly at the ways in which the whole <span class="italic">world</span> is powered by pervasive and persistent ways of making sense, and at various kinds of critique of the world therefore made possible by Christian doctrine.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We can begin thinking about the rationality, the sense-making, involved in the life of a community by comparing it to the sense-making involved in reading a novel. By participating in any community’s life, members will begin to gain some sense of the kind of community it is, of what makes it tick, of how it works and why. They will begin to learn the <span class="italic">story so far</span>, and begin to make sense of it in ways not too dissimilar from what happens when they read a novel. Their ability to go on participating in this community appropriately (rather than sticking out like pirates in a Jane Austen novel) will depend on their having made good sense of that story.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Think of what it is like moving to a new workplace: the initial awkwardness and clumsiness slowly wearing off as you learn how the place works, not just in the obvious ways necessary for doing your job, but in all the subtle and invisible ways that distinguish an insider to this organization from an outsider.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In a religious community, much of the kind of sense-making involved might be pretty low level: <span class="italic">this</span> is the sort of thing we do every Sunday, whereas <span class="italic">this</span> is the sort of thing we only do at major festivals; <span class="italic">this</span> is the sort of way we treat newcomers; <span class="italic">this </span>is the kind of school we send our children to; <span class="italic">these</span> are the kinds of jokes you can tell in church.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-21" id="footnote-169-21-backlink">21</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">From time to time, however, members of this community might find themselves emerging into uncharted waters, unsure of how to go on. What happens when your community floats from being powerless to being powerful, or the other way round? What happens when the patterns of members’ working lives change, and make regular attendance impossible? What happens when your leaders are involved in a scandal? What happens, in other words, when the story does not simply drift along in much the same channel as before, but reaches some more or less dramatic transition?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">When this happens, members of a community may find themselves uncertain about how to proceed; their normal habits of action and imagination may not be enough to carry them through. They may be forced to think more explicitly than they normally do about what it is that they are doing – to find some new way of telling the story so far that will allow them to make sense of this new episode, and to write new chapters in the story in ways that don’t betray what has gone before.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Imagine, for instance, a Christian community that devotes a great deal of time, money and energy to running a Sunday school for children. People coming into the community would slowly learn how much this meant to the church, what kinds of involvement in it were possible for them, what could and could not be suggested as appropriate activities. All this would show that newcomers were learning this bit of the community’s story well enough to know how to go on. Much of the time, the reasons for all this activity won’t be clear to people: this is simply what this community does, and it knows how to do it well.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Now imagine what happens when numbers attending the Sunday school slowly but inexorably decline, until the expenditure of time, energy and money becomes patently absurd. Painful though it might be, members of that community might need to pause and discuss <span class="italic">why</span> they were engaged in this activity in the first place. In a discussion in a church meeting, some might stress that this activity has been more than a way of amusing the children while their parents went about the serious business elsewhere, and more even than a way of training the children up so that they might go on to be good adult churchgoers at some point in the future. The Sunday school has been run because the children are <span class="italic">already </span>full members of the church, but need to have ways of participating in the life of the church that are appropriate to their age and that don’t make it impossible for other age groups to experience forms of worship appropriate to <span class="italic">them</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This attempt to explain why this community has a Sunday school might well be an invention, in one sense: it might well be that the Sunday school in its present form evolved without anyone saying or thinking anything quite like this. However, it might also be a matter if discovery: it might, that is, be a good way of bringing to the surface the kinds of instincts that various people in the community have had about how it should be run. It might be a good way of crystallizing into an explicit account a widespread but vague, mostly implicit sense of what this activity means, or of providing a banner under which people with all sorts of implicit account might rally.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, the appropriateness of this way of making sense might be disputed. Others might suggest that children can’t really be seen as full church members until they have undergone adult baptism or confirmation, or until they are old enough to understand what the Christian gospel means – and that ‘preparation’ for that transition <span class="italic">should</span> be the keynote of the Sunday school’s life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the end, whichever of these ways of making sense of the Sunday school’s existence wins enough hearts and minds will become the basis upon which this community revises its practice. The community can look for new ways in which it could use the time, energy and money that had previously been put into the Sunday school, while still pursuing the ‘same’ goals. Perhaps the community will set up regular ‘all-age worship’ services and a midweek evening youth club. Perhaps it will start examining what it is about their normal Sunday services that is inappropriate for children, and see where else in the church’s life those things might be relocated. All sorts of futures are possible, but each will involve some stab at making sense of the present and the past.</p>

				<p class="text">I have mentioned the kinds of sense-making that might be involved in reading a novel. Think of the difference that there might be between the kinds of sense-making that would be involved in reading Dickens’s <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> for pleasure, and the kind that might be involved in reading his unfinished novel <span class="italic">Edwin Drood</span> with a view to writing your own ending to it (as many authors have).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-22" id="footnote-169-22-backlink">22</a></span> The kinds of attentiveness you would need when reading <span class="italic">Edwin Drood</span> would not be fundamentally different in <span class="italic">kind</span>, but the need to write your own fully appropriate ending to the novel would force you to pay deeper, closer, more persistent attention.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You would have to come up with some way of grasping the plot, the meaning, of the parts that Dickens had completed: spotting a way of making sense of the hints and clues that he left behind. Your way of making sense would be your own invention, and it might be a controversial one, but it would have to be as responsible as you could make it to what Dickens had already written. Without such a way of making sense, there is no way that you could continue where Dickens left off – even if, in practice, your way of making sense of his words will only fully emerge as you write and revise your continuation.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">You can think of Christian theology as the sense-making that is involved when churches want to know how to continue the story so far. A church is, after all, a community that has a whole set of deeply ingrained practices: worshipping; telling stories about Jesus and the early church; reading Jewish Scriptures; baptizing; celebrating the Eucharist; carrying out various forms of mission; and so on. Theology emerges wherever Christians seek to go on doing these things in new circumstances, or seek to deal with changes, challenges and conflicts to them, or seek to pass them on to new generations, or to communicate about them or propagate them beyond their existing cultural settings. Theology is not, or need not be, the imposition of some cold, rationalizing scheme on to the rich and breathing life of a community; it is an inevitable part of how this rich and breathing life is carried on, and passed on.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-23" id="footnote-169-23-backlink">23</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-6-8"><span class="bold">The place of doctrine</span></p>
				<p class="text">I have not quite said enough to explain the basic character of Christian theology. There are, after all, all sorts of different ways that a community might make sense of itself. In some religious communities, this kind of sense-making might be largely delegated to a charismatic leader or group of leaders – people who are seen so to embody all that is best in the community that they can be trusted to know at an intuitive level, or perhaps by divine inspiration, how the community should respond to a new challenge. No one way of telling the story of the community’s ideas or principles is given absolute pride of place – rather, it is the ability of the leader to discern the appropriate account at the appropriate time that is central. (To the question, ‘Who are we?’, such communities might answer simply ‘Ask our leader; we are his people!’)</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In other religious communities, the process by which members make enough sense to go on will be closer to the ways in which lawyers and judges interpret existing laws for new situations. They build on a secure knowledge of the existing history of cases, and therefore have a good grasp of how rulings that makes legal sense can be put together. When they make decisions in ambiguous or unusual cases, they hope to decide those cases in ways that follow existing precedent as far as possible, even when their new decisions themselves set new precedent. (To the question ‘Who are we?’, such a community might reply, ‘We are the community held together by this law.’)</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Following the letter of the law</span></p>
				<p class="text">It can be tempting to think that all the ways in which communities will ‘make sense’ of themselves in times of change will have some kind of ‘letter’/‘spirit’ structure. That is, it can be tempting to think that communities always have to look behind the ‘letter’ of current practice (the detailed present shape of what they do) to discern the ‘spirit’ (the deep principles or ideas or commitments or intentions behind that present shape). Faced with an unprecedented situation, the community alters the letter, but tries to express the same spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">However, not all communal rationality works in quite that way. For instance, Orthodox Jewish law does not allow people to work on the Sabbath, and the definition of ‘work’ given in some classical sources is very broad, so that, for instance, pushing wheelchairs, prams and pushchairs turns out not to be allowed. If someone concerned to alleviate these difficulties worked with a letter/spirit mentality, he might try to discern the deep <span class="italic">principles</span> at stake in this law – its ‘spirit’ or ‘intention’ – and then propose a reformation of the letter of the law that would protect that spirit. That is not, however, the way that certain Orthodox Jewish communities have operated. They do not see themselves as having the freedom to tinker with the letter in this way; instead, their solution is to look at the letter more closely. For instance, in the classical formulation of the Sabbath work laws there are various exemptions, including certain locations in which some kinds of work are allowed. In particular, although disallowed in public spaces, some work is allowed in <span class="italic">private </span>spaces<span class="italic"> </span>– with ‘private’ being defined as spaces fully enclosed by a wall pierced by doors (such as a room or courtyard). Rabbis have looked at the words used in the law’s precise definition of such private space, and tried to see ways in which other, larger kinds of space than were originally envisioned could be included under the same verbal definition. In this case, they realized that a large area – even a whole section of a town – could be turned into private space by the creation of an ‘eruv’, an area surrounded by fences or walls, broken only by ‘doors’ each of which consists of two posts and a lintel (in modern eruvim, most often telegraph poles linked by wire). There are many such eruvim around the world, and in 2002 a large area of North-West London around Golders Green was (somewhat controversially) turned into one – thus allowing a greater degree of freedom to orthodox Jews living within it on the Sabbath. Those who automatically think in terms of letter and spirit often find this sort of development bizarre; but the orthodox proponents of the eruv claim that they can find flexibility in the law precisely by keeping strict hold of the letter, and challenging assumptions about its spirit or intention.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-24" id="footnote-169-24-backlink">24</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In Christianity, a large portion of the discussion of what is central and what is peripheral, of what can be changed and what must be kept the same, of how the same faith can be lived in different circumstances, has tended to cluster around certain <span class="italic">teachings</span> that are held to underlie and hold together the diverse practices and customs of Christian people. These teachings are held to spell out the basic plot of the story so far, and to provide resources for writing fresh chapters of the story to come, in any and every new situation. Discussion of how Christianity should respond to new situations, or to challenges, or to internal disagreements, has tended very often to circle around the ongoing exploration and restatement of these teachings, of their implications, and of the ways in which they relate to and support the whole rich and complex tapestry of Christian life. Such teachings are often called ‘doctrines’ (which is simply a word derived from the Latin for ‘teachings’, just as ‘doctor’ originally meant ‘teacher’).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-25" id="footnote-169-25-backlink">25</a></span> The teachings in question normally have something to do with how Christian people understand themselves and their world as relating to the God who has laid hold of them in Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">‘Who are we?’ Part of the answer that Christians have traditionally given – the part on which discussions of Christian doctrine tends to focus – is, ‘We are the people who believe and celebrate the story summarized in <span class="italic">these</span> teachings; we are the people who believe themselves to have been laid hold of by God in Jesus Christ.’ ‘We believe in God, the Father Almighty …’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-26" id="footnote-169-26-backlink">26</a></span> That does not mean that the life of Christian communities is a life <span class="italic">derived </span>from a set of teachings, as if the teachings came first and the life second; rather it means that the teachings have emerged as relatively stable points in the swirl of ways in which Christians have made sense of their life together.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The indispensable basis of Christian identity</span></p>
				<p class="text">When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, the German churches came under pressure to conform to Nazi ideology. Jewish Christians were compelled to leave the ordained ministry, and the churches were expected to accept the authority over their internal affairs of the German state (the ‘Reich’), headed by Adolf Hitler. Many of the churches, the so-called ‘German Christians’, adopted these measures – some of them very willingly. Adolf Hitler was praised as a prophet come to purify the church.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Some Christians in Germany did, however, resist. At a meeting of theologians, church leaders and others at Barmen in 1934, the theologians Karl Barth and Hans Asmussen drafted a declaration (the ‘Barmen Declaration’) proclaiming that these measures ran against the deep commitments of the Christian Church – the deep sense made by Christian life. And they did so by drawing on certain central Christian <span class="italic">doctrines</span> that they believed were betrayed by these measures. Here are some extracts:</p>
				<p class="quotes">In view of the errors of the ‘German Christians’ and of the present Reich Church Administration, which are ravaging the Church and at the same time also shattering the unity of the German Evangelical Church, we confess the following evangelical truths …<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-27" id="footnote-169-27-backlink">27</a></span></p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">The Christian Church is the community of brethren in which, in Word and Sacrament, through the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ acts in the present as Lord. With both its faith and its obedience, with both its message and its order, [the Christian Church] has to testify in the midst of the sinful world, as the Church of pardoned sinners, that it belongs to [Jesus Christ] alone and lives and may live by his comfort and under his direction alone, in expectation of his appearing.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">We reject the false doctrine that the Church could have permission to hand over the form of its message and of its order to whatever it itself might wish or to the vicissitudes of the prevailing ideological and political convictions of the day. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">The Confessing Synod of the German Evangelical Church declares that it sees in the acknowledgment of these truths and in the rejection of these errors the indispensable theological basis of the German Evangelical Church as a confederation of Confessing Churches. It calls upon all who can stand in solidarity with its Declaration to be mindful of these theological findings in all their decisions concerning Church and State. It appeals to all concerned to return to unity in faith, hope and love.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Here we see one kind of Christian communal rationality at work: digging down in a time of crisis to discover what teachings provide the ‘indispensable … basis’ of the Church’s life, in order to see how those teachings can help members of the Church ‘in all their decisions’. We see, in other words, a church community trying to make sense of itself in order to know how to go on. It is just such Christian ways of making sense that are going to be our main subject matter from now on.</p>

				<p class="text">We can see the emergence of Christian sense-making, and get a stronger sense of how it works, in the earliest extant Christian literature: the epistles of Paul of Tarsus.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the years after his conversion, Paul travelled around spreading the message about Jesus and founding Christian congregations. When it came to tending these churches, however, problems arose. The churches were so widespread that he could only stay in touch intermittently, from a distance, by sending envoys and letters.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-28" id="footnote-169-28-backlink">28</a></span> He sometimes relied simply upon his own personal authority and upon the loyalty that members of those churches felt for him.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-29" id="footnote-169-29-backlink">29</a></span> But such a strategy doesn’t work at all well over a distance, especially when there are other, more charismatic teachers rather closer at hand bidding for your readers’ loyalty. Instead, Paul tried to convince the churches that any guidance he was now offering them was not in fact an attempted exertion of his<span class="italic"> </span>personal<span class="italic"> </span>authority. Rather, he was simply clarifying the implications of the faith they already knew and lived. He claimed that his teaching was simply a continuation of the story they already believed. So Paul tried repeatedly to lead his various congregations to see that what they already knew and believed concerning the Christian faith – the basic practices, experiences and teachings with which they were familiar – contained in embryo all the guidance they now needed if they wanted to know ‘how to go on’ in a Christian way in the complexities of their current situation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In 1 Corinthians 8, we see Paul trying to answer a question posed by the congregations in Corinth: Was it acceptable for them to buy and eat meat from the Corinthian markets, even though they knew that it would have been offered to idols during the slaughtering and preparation process? After stating the problem, Paul gives advice to the Corinthians that he presents as derived at least in part from knowledge they already have – that there is no God but one (v.4), that there is one Lord, Jesus Christ (v.6), that Christ died for each member of the congregation (v.10), and so on. Later in the letter (ch. 10) he returns to the same topic, and in order to refine his advice draws on further ideas already known to them (for example, concerning the Eucharist in v.16, or creation in v.26). There, he explicitly tells the Corinthians to ‘judge for yourselves what I say’ (v.15). That is not a declaration that they should make their own minds up independently, but a prompt to them to <span class="italic">recognize</span> what he was saying as an apt description of their own faith.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This practical need to help distant churches know how to govern themselves meshed with his deepest Christian beliefs. He believed that the world had been addressed by God in Jesus Christ. The kind of ‘making sense’ that he pursued is therefore the attempt to know how to go on given that one has been addressed in this way. (‘Who are we?’ ‘We are the ones who have been addressed by God in Christ.’) This address was clearly not one that directly told one everything one might possibly want to know; it did not, for instance, tell Paul directly the answer he needed to give to Corinthian questions about idol meat. Nevertheless, Paul clearly believed that God’s address already tells one all one needs to know in order to <span class="italic">work out</span> how to handle the question of idol meat – whether to shun it or whether to accept it, or whether to leave that up to the consciences of individual Christians. So instead of answering the Corinthian queries by dragging out some extra bit of the original message that he hadn’t got round to telling them before (‘Oh, by the way, here’s what Jesus said about meat’), he argues that what the Corinthians know about the gospel <span class="italic">already </span>gives them the basic tools they need to work out how to answer their own question, if only they would recognize it. He reasons on their behalf, giving them an answer by showing them how to make sense of themselves.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It would be possible to say, therefore, that Paul’s message to the Corinthians, as he responds to all the questions they have about how to live out their faith, is contained in the verse I have already quoted: ‘Judge for yourselves what I say!’ He believes that they can find the answer to questions about how to go on by digging down into what they already believe – into the basic Christian teachings that have been passed on to them – and by discerning what implications those teachings have for their conduct in the current situation. Of course he thinks he is the best guide to their existing belief, the one able to offer the most convincing ways of telling their story so far, but this isn’t quite the same as simply relying upon his personal, charismatic authority, or the authority of a clear instruction already delivered to them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Neither is it simply a case of straightforwardly ‘applying’ the faith they already have, of course. The Corinthians are going to have to work, with his guidance, to understand that faith more deeply, to see more of how it might hang together, how it might make sense. But as they pursue that investigation of the basic teachings of their faith, they will find (Paul believes) that they are enabled to see more clearly how to go forward in the world. God in Christ has already said to them all that they can need to hear.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-30" id="footnote-169-30-backlink">30</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-line-above">Despite all that I have said so far, careful readers are bound to ask whether we can take seriously Paul’s insistence that the Corinthians should ‘judge for themselves’ – after all, it is the Greeks who desire wisdom, while Christians simply proclaim Christ crucified. The wisdom that Paul is talking about is, of course, primarily the wisdom of Athens, in Tertullian’s terms, and so the kind of wisdom that emerges from the arguments of the Greeks (the ‘debaters of this age’, wise by human standards).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-31" id="footnote-169-31-backlink">31</a></span> I don’t think, however, that Paul’s critique can be restricted simply to one or two specific brands of Greek philosophy; I think it makes sense to construe Paul’s target as human wisdom or human judgement more broadly: ‘the wisdom of the world’, ‘a wisdom of this age’, a wisdom of ‘lofty words’ and ‘plausible words’. It is the prevailing wisdom of the age; it is the normal way in which people were making sense of themselves and of their world in that time and place; it is the wisdom that enabled the man and woman on the Corinthian street to know how to go on as participants in their world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-32" id="footnote-169-32-backlink">32</a></span> Clearly ‘judge for yourselves’ can’t really mean, ‘judge according to human wisdom’. So what can it mean?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">For Paul, the wisdom of the world is utterly foolish because it renders people incapable of making sense of what God was doing on the cross. It is wisdom that assumes that the world’s spring is wound by the kind of power or strength conspicuously absent in the ‘weakness’ of the cross – a kind of power or strength that actually leads only to destruction. If you make sense of yourself and your world in these prevailing ways, Paul says, the idea that God was addressing the world in ‘Jesus Christ, and him crucified’ will be nonsense to you – sheer foolishness – and you will, presumably, be incapable of judging truly for yourself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">But the foolishness of the cross is the foolishness and weakness of God, tripping up the world’s wisdom. And it is therefore, Paul says, the beginning of a new kind of wisdom. ‘We have received … so that we may understand …’ he says; God’s foolishness is something the Corinthians can be ‘taught’. Certainly, the spiritual wisdom to which Paul calls his readers is an understanding based on <span class="italic">faith </span>– but it is a form of understanding nonetheless, and so a way of making sense of oneself and one’s world. Paul is calling for the Corinthians to develop ways of thinking about the world that will allow the story of the cross to make sense. What do they need to believe about themselves, about their world and about God for this story not to be foolish nonsense? How, if the cross has become a central focus of their lives, can they make the kind of sense that will allow them to go on living in its shadow?<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-33" id="footnote-169-33-backlink">33</a></span></p>

				<p class="text">I described earlier the kinds of sense-making that might be involved in trying to write a continuation for Dickens’s unfinished novel, <span class="italic">Edwin Drood</span>. You can imagine an author beginning her continuation of the novel with a chapter in which some startling new incident cast the whole of the story so far in an unexpected new light, making the reader revise his opinion of nearly everything that had happened so far, including his estimate of the motives of various characters and of the relationships between them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Something like that has happened for Paul. The advent of Jesus has cast a new light on to his story, the story of his people and the story of his world. His recognition of this new light has not involved him in tearing up the earlier chapters of the story, but it has made him see them in a whole new way. He will now read his life, Jewish Scripture and the whole world in this new, controversial way – but he will claim that this new way of reading allows him to make deeper, truer sense of what he is reading, and so to write a more compelling continuation.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-34" id="footnote-169-34-backlink">34</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">For the Corinthian community to go about making this new kind of sense involves them allowing some of their existing ways of making sense to be broken open. It involves them allowing themselves to be tripped up by the teaching that God has addressed the world in the life and death of Jesus Christ. Later in his correspondence with them, Paul speaks of ‘destroying arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of God, and taking every thought captive to Christ’ (2 Corinthians 10.4–5). The ‘taking captive’ of their every thought to Christ is the result of insistently taking all their ways of making sense to the cross, to ask whether they still make sense if God is indeed addressing them there. It is this <span class="italic">process</span> of breaking and remaking to which, according to Paul, Christians are called – and it is involvement in this process that underlies any ability they might have, in his eyes, to judge for themselves.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-6-14"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">For Paul, the way God has addressed the world in Jesus Christ upsets some of the sense that the Corinthian community has been making of itself.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Paul also believes that the way God has addressed the world in Jesus Christ enables the Corinthians to make surprising new sense of themselves.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-6-15"><span class="bold">The meaning of life?</span></p>
				<p class="text">If we take our cue from Paul, we will see Christian theology as in the first place an activity of Christian communities – the activity in which such communities take stock of themselves in the light of the activity of God that they believe has called them into being, searching ever deeper into that core in order to see its implications in ever new situations. To study Christian doctrine is to study some of the key ways in which Christian communities have ended up making such sense of themselves and of their world over the past two millennia.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A lot of the people who study theology, however, do so less because they are part of Christian communities that are struggling to know how to go on, and more because they are enquiring individuals trying to make sense of their own lives and of their place in the world. Thankfully, much of what I said earlier about making sense also applies at this individual level. After all, as you live your life, you inevitably make sense of yourself as you go along: you make sense of the story that your own life tells and learn to hazard some guesses about what makes you tick.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Such sense-making is in the background much of the time, but a crisis or a change in circumstances can bring it to the fore. A couple of years ago, I was faced with the possibility of applying for a job at a different university. In the past, when something like that has happened, it has always been pretty obvious to me what I wanted; I have not had to think very hard about what I am applying for and why, only about what to do to avoid making a fool of myself. This time, however, I was genuinely unsure whether I wanted to move or stay. Thinking about it led me to ask uncomfortable questions about what I really wanted and why. I realized, for instance, that I had a rather fanciful vision of myself as becoming a somewhat old-fashioned kind of scholar, slowly working away in book-lined studies and dusty libraries on long, learned articles – and that one of the things driving my application for this job was the thought that the other University would allow me to do more of that. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this picture of who I wanted to be didn’t really do justice to the kinds of work I actually enjoyed most; it was a way of making sense of myself that was not in fact very convincing. I had to think hard about whether, if I acknowledged the more diverse things that I really wanted from an academic job, the proposed move still looked like the right one to make. In other words, this minor crisis provoked me to see that some of the stories I told myself about how I worked and what I wanted were actually untrue, and helped me come to some new, slightly more realistic understanding of how I ticked.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This is a fairly trivial example, and I am sure that even so I am over-dramatizing it. The bigger the crisis or disruption, however, the deeper one might have to dig in order to make liveable sense. One might get pushed beyond comfortable reliance upon habit and made to ask what one <span class="italic">really </span>cares about, what one’s <span class="italic">deeper </span>commitments are. Who are you? Who do you want to be? Posed in the abstract, these can be deeply self-indulgent questions, redolent of teenage angst, sounding portentous while not actually getting hold of any real query. But when they arise in the disrupted course of a life, when a person is striving to make enough sense to go on, or enough sense to feel that he or she has not simply ‘lost the plot’, they can be urgent and unavoidable. Such a person looks for ways of making sense that do justice to what she knows of herself and of her situation. It is not that she simply discovers the right way of making sense, because the process of making sense is always a creative (and controversial) process. But she tries to come up with a way of making sense that does as much justice as possible to the situation and to what she knows of herself.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Espedair Street</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Towards the end of Iain Banks’s <span class="italic">Espedair Street</span>, the central character and narrator, Daniel, whose life has been falling apart, has a moment in which things quite suddenly make a certain kind of sense. He is walking down Espedair Street when, as he says,</p>
				<p class="quotes">slowly a feeling of contentment, intensifying almost to elation, filled me. I couldn’t say why; it felt like more than having gone through a period of mourning and come out the other side, and more than just having reassessed my own woes and decided they were slight compared to what some people had to bear; it felt like faith, like revelation: that things went on, that life ground on regardless, and mindless, and produced pain and pleasure and hope and fear and joy and despair, and you dodged some of it and you sought some of it and sometimes you were lucky and sometimes you weren’t, and sometimes you could plan your way ahead and that would be the right thing to have done, but other times all you could do was forget about plans and just be ready to <span class="italic">react</span>, and sometimes the obvious was true and sometimes it wasn’t, and sometimes experience helped but not always, and it was all luck, fate, in the end; you lived, and you waited to see what happened, and you would rarely ever be sure that what you had done was really the right thing or the wrong thing, because things can always be better, and things can always be worse.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-35" id="footnote-169-35-backlink">35</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This is an example of the kind of rationality I have been talking about. Danny has taken the great mess of experience, of action and rebuff, success and failure, that the novel has described, and come – by whatever conscious and subconscious processes – to an understanding of the stage on which all that drama has been played out. It is not quite that he has made sense of his story, rather that he has made sense of the world in which his story took place, and in which lives can’t be expected to make much sense.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Danny’s vision is not a theological one: he makes no recourse to God, to any kind of providence, to any overarching plot. Nevertheless, the ‘sense’ at which he arrives is not simply the sketching in of assumptions about the social and geographical setting of a particular story; it is something deeper. Danny, we might say, has arrived at an apprehension of the total moral context within which he lives – the texture of the whole world in which his actions and interactions play out, for better or worse. One question that will be worth keeping in mind is how Danny’s vision might relate to specifically Christian ways of thinking about the total moral context. When set alongside a vision like this, must Christian ways of making sense seem like too-easy consolations? Must Christian ways of making sense deny the sheer messy contingency of things that Danny sees?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Paul presents the message of the cross of Christ as a challenge to the Corinthian community’s ways of making sense, but the same message can be as much of a challenge to the ways individuals<span class="italic"> </span>make sense of themselves and their world. The gospel can, for Paul, be seen as the biggest crisis of them all: the irruption into one’s life of the disruptive, disquieting message of the cross – forcing a re-evaluation of all the sense that had glued one’s life together.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As well as being a communal discipline, therefore, theology can be a discipline that involves careful, sometimes painful attentiveness by an individual to the sense by which she lives her life – a process that involves teasing out some of the assumptions and images and dreams and prejudices that shape what she thinks of as normal or proper or acceptable, allowing those to be challenged by the different ways of making sense offered by the Christian gospel. Theology can be what you might call a <span class="italic">spiritual</span> discipline, encouraging deep, careful attentiveness to one’s habits, one’s relationships, one’s assumptions – not simply for <span class="italic">in</span>formation’s sake, but for <span class="italic">trans</span>formation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In this light, I don’t think that it is <span class="italic">only</span> members of Christian communities who can study Christian theology, or those who have (or will have) some responsibility for influencing the course that such Christian communities take. <span class="italic">Anyone</span> can explore and examine the ways of making sense that are explored by Christian communities. Of course, some who are not themselves members of Christian communities will study Christian ways of making sense simply in order to understand how one group in their society understands itself and the world, and that in itself is an important approach. But some others who would not identify themselves as Christian will study Christian theology in order to see whether Christian teachings challenge the sense they have made of themselves, and whether some of the pathways by which Christians go about making new sense of themselves are pathways that they themselves could follow, or whether thinking through their reasons for not following those pathways will itself bring them to a new sense of themselves.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-36" id="footnote-169-36-backlink">36</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Some will perhaps feel themselves to be somewhere in the borderlands of a Christian community, and will study Christian theology in order to discern whether or not they really are members, and what coming down off the fence might mean.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And some who are already convinced Christians will see it as a means of exploring and deepening their own faith, of ‘taking every thought captive’, just as Paul suggested.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">So although the study of Christian doctrine is certainly <span class="italic">tied </span>to Christian communities (because the ways of making sense that are being explored are ones that have grown in the soil of those communities), it is not <span class="italic">restricted</span> to members of those communities: it can be studied by all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons – sometimes simply because they are trying to understand how others live, but often as part of an individual’s own journey of sense-making.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-6-17"><span class="bold">Watching the world</span></p>
				<p class="text">The world around us takes the shape that it takes in large part because of the kinds of sense that the people in it make. People make deep, mostly unnoticed assumptions about what is natural, normal, appropriate, allowable – and the direction of their lives is in part shaped by those assumptions, in part by the interaction and conflict between their assumptions and those of others. This is true at the small scale, and you can see it played out, say, in a family where different assumptions are made by a mother and a daughter over what forms of dress count as acceptable, and over what ‘acceptable’ means in the first place. But it is also true at the larger scale, where the ways that a society or culture functions depend upon matted tangles of assumptions spread below the surface of its life – assumptions and disagreements about what kind of standards of living are sustainable, assumptions and disagreements about the roles of men and women, assumptions and disagreements about differences between races, and so on. The process I spoke of in the previous section, of careful, sometimes painful attentiveness, teasing out some of the assumptions and images and dreams and prejudices that shape what one thinks of as normal or proper or acceptable, and allowing those to be challenged by the different ways of making sense offered by the Christian gospel – that process can be applied on this broader scale as well: attending to and challenging the ways of making sense that power our world. The process of ‘taking every thought captive’ must eventually extend to this wider stage – the stage of culture and politics.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-37" id="footnote-169-37-backlink">37</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">And that means that to be theologically proficient is to become <span class="italic">critically attentive</span> to the world. To become theologically proficient is to start taking critical notice of the ideas and patterns of thought that make the world go round. To become theologically proficient is to learn what happens when you start examining and questioning all those ways of making sense in the light of the gospel, asking what difference might be made to those ways of making sense by the belief that God has addressed the world in Jesus Christ. This kind of intellectual activity has been said to involve having ‘the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-38" id="footnote-169-38-backlink">38</a></span> It is vital to learn all that you can about the Christian story, and the ways in which Christian teachings have been explored and examined over the years, but it is just as vital to read a newspaper, to read novels, to be interested in current affairs, to begin learning to read the whole world around you as carefully as you can. Real proficiency in Christian theology will only emerge as that careful reading of the world and the exploration of the Christian gospel meet and interact with each other – just as the Corinthians were sent deeper into their understanding of the gospel when they were forced to think through challenging situations in the world, and sent deeper into their understanding of that world when they were led by Paul to examine it in the light of the gospel.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In this chapter, I have asked some fairly broad, fairly abstract questions about what rationality is and how it works, and have started setting out some ideas about specifically Christian rationality. This kind of discussion is, I think, important – particularly for those who want to go further in academic theology where such questions about rationality are often debated at fearsome philosophical length. If you are studying theology in an academic context and get asked to write an essay on some title like ‘What is theology?’, this is likely to be the kind of discussion in which you are expected to get embroiled. Important though all this may be, however, its primary purpose is to clarify some of what is going on in the real heartland of theological enquiry: the attempt not simply to talk about the ways that Christians have of making sense of themselves and their world, but actually to get stuck in directly to the rather richer and more varied intellectual activity involved in exploring and critiquing, in the light of Christian teachings, the sense that all of us are always making of ourselves and of our world.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-6-18"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The world around us – its culture and politics – is driven by deeply embedded ways of making sense.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christian theology calls those ways of making sense to account.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">To become proficient in theology it is not enough to get to know Christian doctrines well; one must also cultivate a critical curiosity about the way the world works.</li>

				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Going further</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Here are some directions in which you could pursue further the topics touched on in this chapter:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">My discussion of ‘rationality’ has been what philosophers would call a ‘non-foundationalist’ one. That is, my picture of rationality has not involved finding some absolute and inviolable starting point (‘foundation’) against which all ways of making sense could be tested. Rather, I’ve suggested that rationality operates ‘in the midst of things’, as people take stock of where they’ve got to, using the mental tools available to them. If you want to take this further, you could look at Stanley J. Grenz and John R. Franke, <span class="italic">Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context</span> (Louisville: WJKP, 2000), D. Z. Phillips, <span class="italic">Faith after Foundationalism: Critiques and Alternatives</span>, new edn (Boulder: Westview, 1995), or Fergus Kerr, <span class="italic">Theology After Wittgenstein</span>, 2nd edn (London: SPCK, 1997).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Much of what I said about rationality assumed the priority of ‘abductive’ over ‘deductive’ or ‘inductive’ reasoning. That is, it gives priority to the development or employment of hypotheses that would make sense of the data in question, rather than the deduction of necessary consequences of the data or the proposal of rules on the basis of regularities in the data. For more on this, see Peter Lipton, <span class="italic">Inference to the Best Explanation</span>, International Library of Philosophy, 2nd edn<span class="italic"> </span>(London: Routledge, 2004).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">My description of the way that communities make sense of themselves needs to be probed further. It should not, for instance, be assumed that a viable communal life requires an identical way of making sense to be shared by each participant, or that learning one’s way about in a community is therefore a matter of acquiring precisely the same understanding as others in that community. A community may work precisely by the interaction of differing ways of making sense that mutually reinforce one another. See Timothy Jenkins, ‘The country church – the case of St. Mary’s, Comberton’ in <span class="italic">Religion in English Everyday Life: An Ethnographic Approach</span>, Methodology and History in Anthropology (Oxford: Berghahn Books), pp. 41–74. Jenkins also provides a useful account of ‘apprenticeship’ as the way in which both ordinary people and academic investigators learn their way about in such complex social settings. See ‘Fieldwork and the perception of everyday life’, <span class="italic">Man</span> 29.2 (1994), pp. 433–55.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">My account of how individuals make sense of themselves similarly needs further probing. People never make clear, coherent and comprehensive sense of their own or other’s lives, and attempts to make sense of a life are as much proposals of ways forward as descriptions of the past or present. See Rowan Williams, ‘The Suspicion of Suspicion: Wittgenstein and Bonhoeffer’ in Williams, <span class="italic">Wrestling with Angels: Conversations in Modern Theology</span>, ed. Mike Higton (London: SCM Press, 2007), pp. 186–202, esp. p. 190.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Lastly, there’s a question that haunts this whole book. Do descriptions of Christian doctrine capture the ways in which any real Christian community makes sense of itself? Do descriptions of Christian doctrine really crystallize the inchoate sense that drives the lives of Christian individuals and communities? Or do those individuals and communities regulate themselves in quite different ways, and use Christian doctrine simply as window dressing?</li>

By saying ‘We believe …’, the congregation is not simply proclaiming what they believe; they are proclaiming who they are. Credal statements have been used in baptismal liturgies for as long as they have existed; they begin being used in eucharistic worship from at least the sixth century in the East, and the eleventh in the West. See Joseph A. Jungmann, <span class="italic">The Mass of the Roman Rite: Its Origins and Development</span>, tr. Francis A. Brunner and Chares K. Riepe (London: Burns and Oates, 1959 [German original, 1951]), pp. 295–8.</p>

We would not be getting too far from Paul if we said that the -ology in theology is defined by this logos of the cross.

It is a little unfair to quote the relevant passage on its own because, in order for the ‘revelation’ not to sound cheap, you need to know the story that leads up to it and explains it. You need to see how all this could emerge as an answer for Danny within the context of the questioning forced upon him by his life.</p>
