				<p class="text">In the first part of this book, I argued that Christians can make sense of their lives, corporately and individually, as threefold journeys into the triune life of God. I described how Christians saw Jesus of Nazareth as the visibility of God, God’s way of loving the world and sharing God’s life with the world; I described the Spirit as the power of God’s Christlike love at work in the world, drawing it in conformity to Christ in love for Christ’s Father and the world that the Father loves. In the second part of the book, my emphasis will shift slightly. I will be asking what the life of the world looks like once one sees it as caught up in this divine drama. In this chapter, we will explore the doctrine of creation, and I will try to show that it is not so much a claim about the process by which the universe, life, and human life in particular came into being, and more a claim about how the whole of the world and the whole of life depends at every moment utterly upon the same God who, by Word and Spirit, is drawing the world into fullness of life. The chapter begins an arc that will sweep on into a discussion of the doctrine of providence in the next chapter and culminate in a discussion of the end times (‘eschatology’) in Chapter 9.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">The whole of Psalm 89 is about David and about those who saw themselves as his descendants, the Davidic line of kings. The first part is a song about the steadfast love and faithfulness that God has shown to this Davidic line, which is seen as mirroring the stability of God’s dealings with creation. ‘I will sing of your steadfast love’, says the Psalmist; it is ‘as firm as the heavens’. But the stability of the natural world is not simply a useful metaphor for God’s faithfulness to him: the stability of the natural world displays to the Psalmist the steadfastness and faithfulness of its creator, and it is the very same steadfastness and faithfulness which he sees played out again in God’s covenant towards David and his line. The nature of the God in whom the Davidic line can have faith is displayed to them on the broad canvas of God’s creative work.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, there is an intimate link between the Psalmist’s understanding of <span class="italic">creation</span>, and his understanding of God’s <span class="italic">covenant</span> – God’s promises, God’s faithful compact – with Israel and Israel’s king. One might say that the Psalm only speaks about creation because it wants to speak in a certain way about covenant: God’s creation faithfulness functions as a backdrop, a back-projection from God’s covenant faithfulness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And that means that God’s creative work is seen in highly charged terms. It is not simply the creation of a neutral space <span class="italic">within </span>which the drama of good and evil, of truth and falsehood, of faithfulness and unfaithfulness, will be played out. It is itself an act in the drama. God’s creation of the world is not here presented simply as the calm speaking of a word that instantly brings a world into being; rather, it is presented in more mythological terms as the defeat of the monster Rahab, and the forcing back of the primal sea. The monster and the sea are symbols in Israel – in fact, more widely in the ancient Near East – for chaos, for dissolution, for dissipation, for disorder, for the unpredictable erosion of all stability. So God’s creation of a faithful, reliable world is here being presented as the crushing defeat of unreliability, a campaign of shock and awe against unfaithfulness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The world is held in being by God’s constancy, by God’s holding to God’s promises; it is preserved from an existence entirely erratic, entirely arbitrary, entirely chaotic. Just so, the Psalm carries on, God’s divine goodness gives the people a stable line of kings as a shield against the sea of political chaos, against the monsters of invasion and disintegration. God is faithful, the world is good, and the people are happy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Except that they are not. The second part of the Psalm begins in verse 38 with the words, ‘But now you have spurned and rejected him.’ God has spurned the covenant, has allowed the walls of the kingdom to crumble into ruins, and has allowed David’s line to be cut short. The supposed bulwark against chaos has vanished, and the sea has come flooding back. The goodness, the faithfulness, the reliability of God has been hidden behind death and Sheol, behind Rahab and the sea.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So the Psalm is not simply a calm and cheerful description of a perfect world. It is a call on God to <span class="italic">remember </span>faithfulness. This Psalm proclaims the goodness of creation as a way of proclaiming faith in and hope for redemption – as a way of proclaiming the belief that the chaos that has engulfed David’s line is not the final word, that God’s faithfulness is still there, hidden behind it all, and that God can bring it to the surface again.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-150" id="footnote-169-150-backlink">150</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">This Psalm’s proclamation of the goodness of creation is made in a world that is quite clearly not good; it is made <span class="italic">despite</span> the evil of the world. In fact, it would be truer to say that this proclamation is made <span class="italic">because</span> of the evil of the world. The goodness of creation is proclaimed as a way of interpreting the evil of the world – a way of denying it ultimacy. It does not, this Psalm says, go all the way down, and it will not have the last word. To rest content with evil, as if it were simply part of how things have to be, is to forget God’s covenant.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This Psalm shows us where the heart of the doctrine of creation stands. That doctrine does not have as its central question, ‘How did God create the world?’ We will see more clearly later on that a concern with <span class="italic">mechanism</span>, with the ‘how’ of creation, is a peripheral matter. The doctrine is more about the claim <span class="italic">that </span>God created the world than about <span class="italic">how</span>. Further, Psalm 89 suggests the doctrine does not trade in curiosity about an event deep in the past, over and done with; it is about the holding in being of a stable world now. We might say that the central topic is not simply that God <span class="italic">created </span>the world, but that God <span class="italic">creates</span> the world. Most importantly, however, God’s holding of the world in being is portrayed in the doctrine as a matter of God’s generosity, patience and goodness: the central affirmation is not simply that God creates the world, but that God creates the world <span class="italic">good</span>.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">Just as with Psalm 89, the context for this New Testament reference to creation is talk about salvation, about God’s rescuing of his people from the power of darkness, God’s making his people to be holy, blameless and irreproachable. The author’s trust in God’s redemptive, sanctifying purpose is strengthened by the affirmation that nothing in heaven or earth, visible or invisible, is out of the hands of the one who saves. But there is nothing here like Psalm 89’s depiction of God defeating the monster Rahab; God is not portrayed as one who happens to be strong enough to struggle with chaos and defeat it, however easily. Rather, God is the world’s context. God is the one in whom the whole of creation lives and moves and has its being: ‘in him all things hold together’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-152" id="footnote-169-152-backlink">152</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Specifically, it is in <span class="italic">Christ</span> – the one who shed blood on the cross and was then raised, firstborn from the dead – that all things hold together. The salvation by which Christians believe God has caught them up in Christ, their reconciliation to the Father in the Son by the Spirit, is not a process that will take them away from the world, nor is it the bringing into creation of a foreign element (even if humanity was, before Christ, ‘estranged’ from God), and nor is it an extra to creation, something new and unexpected added to it. No, salvation in Christ is <span class="italic">proper</span> to the world, because the world is Christ’s. In turning to Christ and being grafted by the Spirit into his body, the world is simply becoming what it was created to be. The rule of Christ is not a curb on the world’s freedom, training it into shapes that are not its own – Christ’s work is not like the tending of a bonsai tree, training it into bizarre shapes utterly unlike those that it would take in the wild. Rather, it is the freeing of the world from the darkness and estrangement that have distorted the unity and shape it was given in creation; it is the freeing of the world to be itself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This text’s affirmations about creation all circle around a central claim: that when Christians find salvation in Christ, they are at the same time discovering the deepest truth about themselves and their world. This is a salvation that does not take them away from the world, but sends them deeper into it. And that in turn means that these affirmations about creation are a way of saying something about sin and evil – about everything that stands in the way of love, reconciliation and holiness. It is sin and evil that are the foreign elements; <span class="italic">they</span> are the intruders that do not belong. To be human, to be a creature, is not the same thing as being a sinner, and is not the same thing as being caught up in evil: sin and evil are <span class="italic">distortions </span>of true creatureliness and of full humanity.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-153" id="footnote-169-153-backlink">153</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This is why the gospel can be ‘preached to every creature under heaven’. In Christ, believers find not salvation <span class="italic">from</span> the world, but the salvation for which the whole world was made. No part of the world is beyond salvation’s reach. In this context, to say ‘God created the world’ is another way of saying ‘Jesus is Lord’.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">It is common, when Psalm 139 is quoted, for people to call a halt before they reach that final paragraph, put off by the sudden change in tone. What has been reverent and uplifting suddenly becomes harsh and vindictive. To omit those verses, however, is to disguise the fact that this Psalm is not a piece of speculative reflection on the nature of God’s presence to human beings, nor a pious and comforting meditation on the intimacy of God’s relation to the believer. It is a plea for help. It is a cry sent up from within a disordered world where the wicked thrive, those who deny God prosper, and where the situation of the righteous is parlous. It is a cry sent up from within a world where righteousness and wickedness are invisible, hidden behind a surface of unjust prosperity and indiscriminate suffering.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is in this context that the Psalmist makes his declaration of faith in a God who sees truly, who can see past appearances (prosperity, adversity) to what lies beneath (wickedness, righteousness). It is a declaration of faith in a God who not only sees that hidden righteousness and wickedness, but has the power to make it visible to all: to vindicate the righteous, and to bring the wicked to nothing. It is a declaration of faith in the one who has the power to restore the deeper, truer order of things, to clean away the grime that has accumulated on the surface of creation until the true colours shine out again, and to re-establish love and justice.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is, for the Psalmist, simply no possibility that these deep truths could be hidden from God. Despite that phrase about ‘searching out’, God sees these things not because God is very good at seeing through disguises, such that it would be very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to fool God, but because the very idea of hiding righteousness or wickedness from God is a nonsense. God knows the heart of the Psalmist, for instance, not because God has some kind of spiritual endoscope, but because God <span class="italic">made</span> that heart.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, God does not ‘enter into’ a relationship with a ready-formed Psalmist; God does not ‘get to know him’, however successfully. God does not start from the Psalmist’s outside and work inwards. No; everything about the Psalmist – his thoughts, his words, his inmost constitution – is already seen by God, already held by God, because it was made by God, written in God’s book. To think of there being any aspect of the Psalmist beyond God’s knowledge or control is, according to this Psalm, simply nonsensical.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Psalmist also says that there is nowhere he can go in the world that would take him beyond God’s reach. Although the world is a realm in which contradiction to God appears to thrive, it is not a realm any part of which is distant from God. If the wicked manage to deny God, they do not do so by backing away from the reach of God’s hands, so that God must lunge if God wants to grab hold of them again. There simply isn’t any direction that they can take that would count as a step away from God. Although it is possible to live for God or against God, there is, in reality, no going further away from or closer to God. God is not at some one location in the world, with some parts of the world more nearly in God’s reach than others: God is everywhere – or perhaps it might be better to say, everywhere is in God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-155" id="footnote-169-155-backlink">155</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The doctrine of creation does not, then, attempt to describe a distant initiating event that set this world unrolling like a carpet away from the throne of its maker. Rather, it declares an obstinate faith that in all times and places, however dark and disordered they might be, the world is in the hands of the one who made it and who knows it and who cannot and will not abandon it. Rowan Williams has put it well.</p>
				<p class="quotes">If God is faithfully present in the glory and the beauty of creation, what is going on when I don’t sense that? Well, the answer is, the same thing is going on. God is going on. And how can I believe that? ‘With face and hands clinging unto thy breast. Clinging and crying, crying without cease.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-156" id="footnote-169-156-backlink">156</a></span></p>

				<p class="text">Psalm 139 begins to expose one of the sinews of the Christian doctrine of creation. That doctrine in its classic form involves a rejection of one simple but misleading way of thinking about the relationship between God and the world, in which God on the one hand struggles with the world on the other, succeeding in knowing the world only because the divine gaze is so penetrating, and shaping it only because the divine strength is so great. Any such picture of struggle<span class="italic"> </span>between God and the world in effect makes God and the world two realities within a context that contains both of them – a context that is bigger than the world, and also bigger than God: an arena in which they compete for space and control. This is not the picture that the classic Christian doctrine paints.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That doctrine does not express a hope that the world will be subdued by the force of a God who is outside it; it does not hope for an imposition of order from outside the world (an enemy army come to impose democracy, say). It is, rather, expressive of a hope for the world’s true flourishing in God. God is the context<span class="italic"> </span>in which the world grows: God is not an outsider to the world, because God is the space in which the world lives and moves and has its being.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Rather than thinking of God as an artisan, tinkering with the world on his workbench, one might think instead of God as the world’s mother, and of the world growing in God’s womb. The world, like a foetus, is not the same reality as the mother, but it is wholly dependent upon the mother; everything that sustains and nourishes it comes from the mother. It grows only because the mother has opened up a space within herself for something that is not her, and given herself over to the support of this something. The doctrine of creation speaks of this kind of absolute and ongoing dependence of the creation upon its creator, and of this kind of intimacy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This means, incidentally, that talk of God’s transcendence (that is, of God’s difference from creation and Lordship over it) and talk of God’s immanence (of God’s presence in and to creation) go hand in hand. Transcendence and immanence are not qualities that need balancing off against one another, as if they pulled in different directions. God’s transcendence <span class="italic">is</span> God’s intimacy. That is, God’s transcendence consists in the fact that God is not an element <span class="italic">in </span>the world, with a specific location, but that context upon which every creaturely thing utterly depends, resting upon God directly and entirely for its existence.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Against Gnosticism</span></p>
				<p class="text">A debate about creation was one of the first major Christian theological controversies. In the second century, there were various Christian groups that have been labelled ‘gnostic’. At least some of those groups taught that creation was not an act of divine will, the deliberate and loving bringing into being of a reality distinct from God that God could love, but that it involved rather a process of ‘emanation’. From the reality of God there emerged spiritual realities distinct from God, and from those spiritual realities there emerged further realities, somewhat less spiritual – and so on through numerous ranks of less and less spiritual creatures until eventually there emerged the gritty stuff of the material world. That world was not the direct creation of God, but the product of beings much lower in the hierarchy – even, perhaps, of beings so removed from God that they could be thought of as malevolent. The material world was seen as distant from the purely spiritual reality of God from whom it had ultimately descended, but it was connected to it by this great chain of emanations, and there were within it – within at least some human beings – sparks of more spiritual reality that could in principle return back up the hierarchies, from less to more spiritual, and so return to God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In response to this kind of theology, theologians like Irenaues of Lyons insisted that creation was a direct act of God’s loving will, bringing the whole world into being and holding it in being, and that even though that meant one must operate with an absolute distinction between the Maker and the made, rather than with a graded hierarchy of more and less spiritual, one could not properly think of creation as lying at any <span class="italic">distance </span>from God. God is immediately present to all that God has made.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-157" id="footnote-169-157-backlink">157</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">I argued in earlier chapters for the propriety of imagining God’s life as a community of persons, united in love. In that context, the act of creation can be understood as that community making space within itself for the participation of others. That Triune life, which was complete in itself, is opened up in an act not of necessity but of delighted generosity – of the kind of joy that desires to share a pleasure with others. I spoke of ‘perichoresis’ as meaning, literally, something like ‘giving place to one another in turn’. The doctrine of creation is the claim that the persons of the Trinity also make way for the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is the point of the traditional Christian claim that God created the world <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span> – ‘from nothing’. There is, Christians have said, no medium, no resistant stuff, from which God wrests creation: all that we can picture God as working on is, as it were, God’s own life, so as to make space or give nourishment to creation. And if God’s life is wholly generous, wholly giving, wholly caught up in delighted sharing (as the doctrine of the Trinity declares) then the act of creation is entirely proper to God’s life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Creation is not really to be thought of, in Christian theology, as an act of divine strength, or as a divine achievement. It is an act of love, and God is love. And the affirmation of the doctrine of creation by Christians is therefore the affirmation, in any and all circumstances, that the only source and ground of their lives and their circumstances is the loving generosity of God, and that their lives and their world grow in the medium of this loving generosity, nourished and upheld by it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">How on earth this affirmation can be made in a world of sin and suffering is a topic to which we will be returning.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Children of a lesser God</span></p>
				<p class="text">One corollary of all this, which has been rather unevenly realized in the history of Christianity, is that there can be no ‘children of a lesser God’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-158" id="footnote-169-158-backlink">158</a></span> That is, there is a universalism built into Christianity: <span class="italic">all</span> people are created by God; all people owe their existence to the generosity of God. There are no groups of people who, simply by virtue of <span class="italic">what</span> <span class="italic">they are</span>, are more distant from God, or whose lives are not to the same extent gifts of God’s generosity. Of course, all people live to one extent or another against the grain of this connection to God – but for all people that is a distortion of their true reality. Salvation, participation in the life of God, is (according to the doctrine of creation) equally proper to everyone, regardless of their sex, their race, their orientation, and their background.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-13-8"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christian theology does not picture creation as the outcome of God’s struggle with some material.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">According to Christian theology, the only source and ground of our lives and our circumstances is the loving generosity of God.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-13-9"><span class="bold">Creation and incomprehensiblity</span></p>
				<p class="text">The claim that God has made all things from nothing provides the deepest ground of classical Christian theology’s insistence that God is incomprehensible. Think, for instance, about the distinction between male and female. If God made them both, and if both are equally called to share the life of God, then one must think of God’s life as being ‘beyond’ the difference between male and female. And so although one might use gendered language and images to speak of God – indeed, although one might find it impossible not to – one will know that ultimately such language must fail to grasp hold of a God who cannot be characterized as either male or female. God’s difference from me, a male human being, is not like the difference from me of my wife, a female human being. It is a different kind of difference: God is <span class="italic">more</span> different than that.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But the doctrine of creation affirms not just that God made both men and women, but that God made all things – male and female, physical and mental, animate and inanimate, visible and invisible, material and immaterial, and so on – and made all things to share in the life of God. God is, therefore, <span class="italic">beyond</span> the distinction between physical and mental, <span class="italic">beyond</span> the distinction between animate and inanimate, <span class="italic">beyond</span> the distinction between visible and invisible, <span class="italic">beyond</span> the distinction between material and immaterial. God is beyond all distinctions between kinds and types of God’s creatures, because God is creator of all. God’s difference from the world is not like the difference of one creature from another creature, however great that difference might be. God is more different from me than my wife is; more different from me than a rock is; more different from me than a feeling of nostalgia is; more different from me than the colour blue is; more different from me than the number three is; more different from me than the idea of unity is. And that does not mean that God is very, very distant from me – because God is beyond the difference between proximity and distance; language about distance or closeness fails in the end to do justice to God no less than does language about male and female.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">God is, according to the doctrine of creation, beyond all creaturely distinctions, and so although one may and must use all sorts of creaturely language and imagery to speak about God, God is not grasped and held by that language. And as we have no ways of speaking that do not trade in the coinage of creaturely distinctions, we have no language that is adequate to God.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">No thing</span></p>
				<p class="text">The late medieval German theologian and philosopher, Nicholas of Cusa, was fascinated by the unknowability of God. He wrote a book, <span class="italic">De li non aliud </span>– <span class="italic">On God as Not Other</span>, in which he argued, in effect, that God was not a ‘thing’, not some particular object (of whatever kind) that could, like all things, be defined by means of some set of distinctions (a thing is always <span class="italic">this</span> not<span class="italic"> that</span>). Although the details of Cusa’s own presentation are – to say the least – somewhat abstruse, his general point holds: God is <span class="italic">never </span>one more thing in any list of things. God is no thing.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-159" id="footnote-169-159-backlink">159</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">That human beings can speak about God at all, Christian theology says, is not because human language inherently has the capacity to speak about God. It is only possible because God has grasped hold of human beings – of these language-using, distinction-making, creaturely and particular beings. And although God remains God in the process, and so incomprehensible, unknowable and unutterable, God is named on the basis of the way in which human beings see themselves being grabbed hold of, in Christ and the Spirit. Christians, in other words, can only speak directly and properly about God’s <span class="italic">economy</span> – about God’s work within creation for creation’s salvation. And they can only trust that in speaking about and knowing this economy they are knowing the one whose economy it is, and that their speaking is part of the process by which they are being drawn into creaturely conformity to God’s immanent life. They must, however, acknowledge that that immanent life remains utterly beyond them. This is what it means to worship the creator of all things.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This prohibition paradoxically extends to talk about creation itself. As the first three sections of this chapter should have made clear, Christian theology names God as creator on the basis of the economy of salvation – that is, on the basis of the ways in which they believe God relates to them in history. And that economy gives them all sorts of imaginative ways of gesturing towards God’s creative act: talk of mothers’ wombs, or of the extending of the community of the Trinity, and so on. But Christians can no more directly and finally grasp what it is for God to create than they can directly and finally grasp anything about God. Christians know that, on the basis of God’s dealings with them, they cannot but imagine God as creator, but they also know that they cannot literally and fully know what it is for God to create.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Father or Mother?</span></p>
				<p class="text">I have used the name ‘Father’ to speak of the first person of the Trinity in order to keep a strong connection between what I say about the immanent life of God and what I say about the patterns, the drama, of the gospel story – in which the person in question is named by Jesus as his Father. The word ‘Father’ when used of God is therefore always shorthand for ‘the one whom Jesus called Father’ or ‘the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This ‘Father’, however, is one whose life consists in a kind of self-giving which eternally gives birth to a Son; he is one whose generativity is more like a womb in which another is born and grows than like one who at some point makes a decision to create something external to himself. In any culture remotely like mine, that puts a cat among the pigeons that are kept by the male name ‘Father’. In order to do justice to that disruption, one may need to turn for help in this to texts like Isaiah 66.12–13, which speaks of God as a mother, comforting Jerusalem by breastfeeding her, carrying her around, dandling her on her knees; or to Deuteronomy 32.18, Psalm 90.2 and Numbers 11.12, which speak of God giving birth to Israel. And one may need both kinds of imagery – paternal and maternal – to do justice to the image of God speaking creation into being, and providing the space within which creation grows and kicks. It may be only by the unstable, imagination-foxing mixture of these different patterns of imagery, male and female, that one can both speak aptly of God, and yet be reminded that God’s immanent life is beyond one’s imagination, and cannot be pinned down on any of our gender maps.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-160" id="footnote-169-160-backlink">160</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-13-10"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">God is, according to classical Christian theology, beyond the distinction between male and female.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">God is also beyond all other creaturely distinctions.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">All language, which inevitably works with those distinctions, fails when it tries to speak directly of God.</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-13-11"><span class="bold">Being creatures</span></p>
				<p class="text">The doctrine of creation in Christian theology is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it calls human beings to acknowledge and celebrate God as God – as the ungraspable Creator and sustainer of all that is. On the other hand, it calls human beings to acknowledge that they are not gods but creatures, and to celebrate that fact.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If God is the creator, and so beyond any distinctions between mental and physical, material and immaterial, visible and invisible, flesh and spirit, then there is no greater bar to physical, material, visible, fleshy creatures like us human beings participating in the life of God than if we were somehow purely mental, immaterial, invisible and spiritual. Christians can therefore proclaim that the whole of creation, in all its parts, was made for participation in the divine life, which is not reserved simply for their spiritual part or aspect, some detachable soul or spirit that is understood somehow to relate more closely to God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The central confirmation and ground of this affirmation is, for Christians, the incarnation. I explained in Chapter 5 that, for classical incarnational doctrine, Jesus’ whole bodily, creaturely, finite life – material, visible and particular, caught up in a web of relationships and language, located at a particular point in space and time – was a life utterly caught up in and transparent to the life of God. The difference between God’s life and creaturely life is not in Christian theology the kind of difference that would mean that creatures could only share that life or mirror that life to the extent that they ceased to be creatures. It is a different kind of difference, and the incarnation shows us that it makes sense to say that creaturely life can, in its own way, genuinely conform to and display the life of God without ceasing to be fully and entirely creaturely. Christians believe that the world is called to the fulfilment of its creatureliness, not the abandonment of it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This means, however, that Christians are called to recognize that their creatureliness is not an impediment to, but is the material for, godly life. And since to be our kind of creature is (among other things) to be finite, to be bodily and to be dependent upon the environment and one another, Christians are called to see their finitude, their bodiliness, their dependence and their relationships as the material in which their participation in God’s life will be displayed. God is making sculptures, and this is the kind of clay God is using – and, like a good sculptor, God will work with the properties of the material, rather than fighting against it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">I will focus on just two aspects of this now. In the first place, we are bodies. We don’t just <span class="italic">have</span> bodies, as if they were possessions that we could discard. We <span class="italic">are </span>bodies, and bodies are all that we are. The Christian hope is hope for resurrection, bodily resurrection like that of Jesus, and whatever mysterious fulfilment and completion of bodily life Christians hope for, belief in the resurrection of the body rather than the immortality of the soul means that Christian hope remains bodily. Now, it is often said that Christians in the past seemed to hate their bodies, and to live in denial of this claim – and there is altogether too much truth in that. Nevertheless, the adoption of ascetic practices, of self-denial, of various kinds of abstinence, can be seen in a much more positive light. It is not the rejection of bodily life as irrelevant or simply as a burden, but an attempt to shape and train it, to find ways in which bodily life with all its needs and appetites could itself be made to display a person’s godliness: the shifting of the focus of their desires away from themselves and onto God and their neighbours. It need be no more antagonistic to bodily life as such than is an athlete who trains for hours a day in preparation for a big race, regulating diet, posture and activity according to some careful plan. Of course, in practice, this kind of ascetic training could all too easily slip over into disgust for the body and its needs, or into a dangerous denial of the physical necessities and pleasures of human life. But the basic idea beneath those distortions is correct, and is indeed essential to a Christianity that holds to the doctrine of creation: bodily life, precisely as bodily, is the material of salvation. As those who hold to the doctrine of creation, Christians are bound to ask how their bodily habits and actions contribute to or detract from the growth of love and justice. Should one buy fair-trade coffee? How do feasting and fasting both build up the church’s common life? What is a Christian responsibility in a world that so pervasively turns bodies – particularly female bodies – into commodities in advertising and on fashion catwalks as much as in brothels and pornography? How can Christians model a loving acceptance of the frailty, mortality and laughable clumsiness of human bodies? How can Christians practise acceptance of all, whatever their body shape, size or colour? These are the sorts of questions that a doctrine of creation makes unavoidable.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In the second place, we human beings are entirely dependent upon our environment. Creation is a complex of interdependent parts, and we are inescapably part of it. Our existence, let alone our flourishing, is dependent upon an intricate web of connections and influences. The doctrine of creation calls upon Christians to recognize and celebrate that, rather than live in denial of it. To pursue love and justice, and the proper flourishing of human life, is inevitably also to care about the ways in which human beings fit into their wider natural environment. It is natural for Christians who have a doctrine of creation to care about farming, about rain forests, about urban planning, about the built environment, about climate change, about pollution, about the distance travelled by food to our supermarkets, about fish stocks, about energy production. Not to care at all about these things would be a denial that we are creatures. The doctrine of creation tells Christians that this whole interconnected world – the fragility and complexity of whose interconnectedness have become much more frighteningly visible in recent decades – is the world in which God is saving humanity, and the world that God made to share in God’s own life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is not the place for a detailed examination of environmental theology. Nevertheless, we have already unearthed some of the bones of such a theology. In the first place, as I have been stressing, the earth is a whole – an interconnected web of dependences. In the second place, that this interconnected whole exists is, the doctrine of creation <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span> says, a result of God’s love – it is a product of God’s generosity, giving space to the existence of something other than God not out of need but out of delighted joy. In the third place, this interconnected whole that exists as an expression of God’s delight can therefore be thought of as itself one vast symphony of praise to God. By being themselves, all creatures praise God: they reflect God’s joy back to God. The mountains and the hills burst into song, and all the trees of the field clap their hands.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-161" id="footnote-169-161-backlink">161</a></span> Rather than seeing themselves as separate from ‘nature’, and seeing nature as subordinate to their needs and projects, the doctrine of creation can suggest that human beings might be better thinking of themselves as players in an orchestra, to whom has been given the melodic line that weaves all the other instrumental parts into a whole and offers it back to the listening composer.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As this suggests, the doctrine of creation is a resource for the shaping of Christian imagination. It pushes Christians to re-imagine the world and their place in it, and so to begin to live in it differently. The world is not simply a warehouse of brute facts, nor an indifferent vastness: it is the creation of a creator, and love is ‘creation’s final law’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-162" id="footnote-169-162-backlink">162</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-13-13"><span class="bold">Addendum: Creation and creationism</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">I would have liked to finish the chapter at this point, and move on to the next chapter’s discussion of providence, which is really nothing but an extension of the discussion of creation. There is, however, one topic that it is sadly necessary to touch on, however briefly – if only because it is the topic that most people think of first when they hear the doctrine of creation mentioned, and to which many have devoted a titanic expenditure of energy. This is the topic of creation<span class="italic">ism</span> – that is, the claim that the Christian doctrine of creation involves a direct challenge to standard scientific explanations of the origins of the universe, or at least of life on earth, and that the upholding of this challenge is a vital duty for Christians in today’s world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It should have become clear by now that I do not believe that the role played by the doctrine of creation in Christianity has a great deal to do with <span class="italic">explanation</span>. That is, it does not have a great deal to do with accounts of <span class="italic">how</span> life originated on earth, or of <span class="italic">how</span> human beings appeared among the other life forms. I hope I have done enough to call into question the idea that belief in God as creator originally grew from any impetus towards explaining the way the world worked. From the evidence I have presented, the idea of God as creator seems to have more to do with God’s people learning how to face evil, injustice and suffering than with their attempts to explain where we all came from. I contend therefore that it is a mistake to think of the doctrine of creation as a pre-scientific way of explaining the existence of the world – whether one then goes on to defend that pre-scientific way, or to attack it. That is not what the doctrine is about.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, the doctrine does provide a kind of answer to the question, ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ – though it is a strange kind of answer. The answer that the doctrine gives is ‘God’, and that is not really a claim that could count as an <span class="italic">explanation</span>, God is that which we cannot grasp, and about whose act of creation we can only speak in language that we admit to be inadequate. What kind of explanation is that?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Again, the doctrine does claim that there is a purpose to creation: the extension of God’s life for the inclusion of creation. But it is no obvious matter to see how to turn that claim into a claim about the processes or mechanisms by which the world ended up taking the shape that it now does. Even if one thinks that this claim tells one that God’s purpose was to ensure that there would be conscious beings capable of love (and given some of the things Christians have wanted to say about the whole of creation praising God, it may be that even that is a step too far), it is not easy to see how to turn that into a claim about the processes or mechanisms by which such life arose. Even when speaking of the purpose for which the world was created, the doctrine of creation has little if anything to do with causal explanation.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The end of why</span></p>
				<p class="text">One way that Christians have sometimes thought about God as creator is by thinking of God as the place where the asking of ‘Why?’ stops. Faced with any thing or event in the world, we can always ask ‘Why?’ Why did that happen? Why is it there? And, given any answer to those questions, one can always (as my three-year-old daughter knows) ask ‘Why?’ again. Why do I feel warm? Because my radiator is warm. But why is my radiator warm? Because there is hot water in it. But why is the water hot? Because it has been heated by the boiler. But why? But why? But why? I can keep on asking the question, and if I keep on long enough I will either find myself asking about where human beings and their desires and needs come from, or where the material stuff that constitutes the world around me comes from, or where the laws of physics that keep the whole thing ticking over come from. Eventually, my questions will become unanswerable: Why is there anything at all? Why should it have any particular character? Medieval theologians suggested that God is where the asking of ‘Why?’ stops, because God is a reality that could not not be, a reality that is in no way contingent, a reality that it makes no sense to imagine not existing or not being precisely as it is – and so a reality for which the Why question finds no purchase. That is the difference, they said, between creator and creation: creation is the realm of ‘Why?’; the creator is the only unquestionable answer. This is a claim that is absolutely independent of what there actually is in the world and how it works, and so a claim that is absolutely independent of any explanation of the world that works at the level of mechanisms and processes – it is not a response to the question, ‘Why this particular thing?’ but to the question, ‘Why anything whatsoever?’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-163" id="footnote-169-163-backlink">163</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">When one looks at the vast majority of what gets said and written about the doctrine of creation these days, it is hard to avoid the sense that there are many who have taken a wrong turning, and have substituted vigorous defence of a set of quasi-scientific explanatory claims for adherence to the Christian doctrine of creation. In so doing, they have, with the best of intentions, helped to bury the real claims of that doctrine (which, as we have seen, are claims about covenant and gospel, claims about the good news of salvation). What proponents of creationism or intelligent design defend has little inherent connection to the heart of the Christian gospel, and the God to whom they refer in those defences does not seem to be clearly identifiable as the God of Jesus Christ – even if in the rest of their lives these creationists might be devoted Christians who follow that God wholeheartedly. If it is Christianity and the Christian gospel that they are wanting to defend, they have picked the wrong battle lines, and to the extent that they make the manning of those battle lines central to the public presentation of Christianity, they have contributed much to the contemporary discrediting and misunderstanding of the Christian faith.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">There is much more that could be said about Christian attitudes to environmentalism. A famous article by Lynn White, ‘On the historical roots of our ecological crisis’, <span class="italic">Science</span> 155 (10 March 1967), pp. 1203–07, laid a good deal of the blame at the door of Christian theology; an extract from the article and some responses were printed in the <span class="italic">Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation</span> 21 (1969), pp. 42–7, and are available online at http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1969/JASA6–69White.html. Positive theological responses to the environmental crisis can be found in, among many others, Michael Nothcott, <span class="italic">The Environment and Christian Ethics</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996); John Cobb Jr, <span class="italic">Is it Too Late? A Theology of Ecology</span> (New York: Macmillan, 1971); Leonardo Boff, <span class="italic">Ecology and Liberation</span> (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1995); Celia Deane-Drummond, <span class="italic">The Ethics of Nature</span> (Oxford: Blackwell, 2003); and Rosemary Radford Ruether, <span class="italic">Gaia and God</span> (San Francisco: Harper, 1994).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">What I have said briefly about the importance of bodies could be explored much more fully. Various questions about bodiliness are covered by Nancey Murphy, <span class="italic">Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) and Elisabeth Moltmann–Wendel, <span class="italic">I Am My Body</span> (London: Continuum, 1995). One specific question that properly comes up is how Christians should live with disabled bodies. Nancy Eisland’s <span class="italic">The Disabled God</span> (Nashville: Abingdon, 1994) is a key resource; as is Frances Young’s <span class="italic">Face to Face</span>, 2nd edn (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1990).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">To my mind, the real challenge which evolutionary theory poses to Christian theology is over the goodness of creation. The natural world, as pictured by evolution, is a battleground: the motor that drives evolutionary diversification is bloody competition; the long history of evolution is littered not just with slaughtered individuals, but with whole exterminated species – many more than are alive today. The picture is a bloody and violent one. Can one really call such a creation ‘good’? We will be discussing the question of suffering and the goodness of God at length in a later chapter, but this particular issue will not be our focus. For those who want to pursue this question further, I recommend Christopher Southgate, ‘God and evolutionary evil: Theodicy in the light of Darwinism’, <span class="italic">Zygon </span>37.4 (December 2002), pp. 803–24.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">I have deliberately avoided, for reasons I explained, the kind of discussion of the doctrine of creation that gets mired in ‘science versus religion’. I am not going to reverse that decision in this brief note, but simply suggest that the best preparation for discovering what positive contact there might be between theological and scientific ways of talking about the world around us is to inform oneself about the history and present state of science, and to try to capture the sense of wonder and delight that can accompany scientific exploration. Start with Bill Bryson’s, <span class="italic">A Short History of Nearly Everything</span>, (London: Black Swan, 2004) and Oliver Sacks, <span class="italic">Uncle Tungsten</span> (London: Picador, 2002), and then take a look at the wide-ranging discussions in Christopher Southgate (ed.), <span class="italic">God, Humanity and the Cosmos</span>, 2nd edn (London: Continuum, 2005).</li>
