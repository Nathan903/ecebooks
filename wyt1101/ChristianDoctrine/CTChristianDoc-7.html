				<p class="text">In Chapter 2, I argued that Christians can make sense of their lives, individually and corporately, as journeys on which they are being drawn deeper into the life of God, and in Chapter 4 I will explore some ways in which that basic claim can be expanded and enriched. This chapter, however, is a pause for clarification, and for the introduction of some distinctions and terminology that should make the way through the next chapter easier. I am going to look at different kinds of language that Christians use to speak about God and, in particular, examine the question of how Christians can speak about God at all without falling into idolatry.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that, for Christian theology, God is in one sense strictly unknowable, but that in another sense God makes Godself known;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">claim that there are three broad types of Christian language about God: pragmatic, propositional and imaginative;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">introduce a fundamental distinction between God’s immanent life and God’s economy (or the economy of salvation); and</li>

				<p class="quotes">6Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god. … 8Do not fear, or be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it?

Let them all assemble, let them stand up; they shall be terrified, they shall all be put to shame. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">13The carpenter stretches a line, marks it out with a stylus, fashions it with planes, and marks it with a compass; he makes it in human form, with human beauty, to be set up in a shrine. 14He cuts down cedars or chooses a holm tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. … 16Half of it he burns in the fire; over this half he roasts meat, eats it and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, ‘Ah, I am warm, I can feel the fire!’ 17The rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, bows down to it and worships it; he prays to it and says, ‘Save me, for you are my god!’</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">In the previous chapter, I argued that freedom and faithfulness – God’s freedom to transcend any definitions arrived at by God’s people, and God’s faithfulness to the promises declared to those people in the past and in the present – are constitutive of God’s self-identification. That continues to be true in this passage from Isaiah. At first sight, it presents us with two sets of people. On the one hand there are the people of Israel, directly addressed and declared to be God’s witnesses; they know God as the rock upon which they stand and as their Lord, their King and their Redeemer. They know God’s identity ‘from of old’, and may trust God to be true to it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand stand the idolaters or false witnesses who are not addressed but described with biting sarcasm. They do not know God; they substitute for the true God things made with their own ‘merely human’ hands. They worship mundane realities that they can control and use for their own benefit; their gods are in their power.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In one corner, then, we have the true witnesses who rest in the hands of their God; in the other, the false witnesses who hold their god in their hands. There is a twist in Isaiah’s oracle, however. God says to those who are being addressed directly and comfortingly as true witnesses, ‘I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like mist; <span class="italic">return to me</span>, for I have redeemed you.’ Having been addressed as those in the right, it becomes clear that they are no strangers to the wrong, and perhaps have not yet abandoned it. Tug on this thread and the passage, with its commendation of true witnesses and condemnation of false, unravels to reveal a plea to Israel to repent, to turn away from false witness and from idolatry, and to <span class="italic">become</span> the true witnesses that they are not. The problem of idolatry is not somebody else’s problem – it is theirs.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This passage was, of course, written in a specific historical situation, and addressed to a people involved in various very specific forms of idolatry. Nevertheless, it is a tributary of one deep stream of Jewish thinking that was eventually to flow into a more radical interpretation of idolatry. Idols were eventually abjured not because they were representations of the wrong god, nor because they were the wrong kind of representation of the right God, but just because they were <span class="italic">representations</span>, and God was held to be beyond all representation. This God is held not to be the kind of God who can aptly be depicted ‘in the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth’ (Exodus 20.4). No particular part of creation – visible or invisible, natural or artificial, animate or inanimate, human or animal – can be an adequate representation of the God who is the source of them all.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-58" id="footnote-169-58-backlink">58</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Many theologians in both Judaism and Christianity have wrestled with the snares buried in any human description of God because they have been all too aware that human beings are perennially tempted to tame God, to remake God in their own image, or to slip God into their pockets. They have known that all descriptions that human beings might be capable of deploying are finite, because they are built from words whose everyday applicability is to finite things in the world, and because they are painted with imaginations all of whose colours come from life in the midst of that world. To use these descriptions of God is always to describe God in terms more normally applicable to things that are not God. Any talk about God – any picture, any image, any account, any story, any name, any description, any theory, any hypothesis – therefore presents believers with the temptation to absolutize something finite, something made with human hands (or human voices or human minds). That is, any talk about God presents a temptation to take a finite description not as a hand gesturing towards a God who is always more surprising than any description allows, but rather as a tool that enables the believer to grasp hold of God, to delimit God, to make God out as finite – to de<span class="italic">fine</span> God, and so to limit and define the demand that is made by knowing God.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Some Examples</span></p>
				<p class="text">Consider the following descriptions of God:</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Rock</span>: It is not difficult to see that this is a metaphor, describing God in terms appropriate to something that is not God. It is (or was, when the metaphor was fresh) a striking way of helping people to glimpse God’s faithfulness and dependability, but the limit to how far one can take the metaphor is obvious; it is a limit that one would find oneself beyond were one to ask what God’s mineral content was, for instance. Christians know that God is not a rock, so to describe God as one presents little temptation to idolatry.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Wise</span>: What about this one, though? It too is a word whose meaning we learn first through ordinary human examples – from which we gather that it means something like ‘able to judge appropriately, on the basis of long experience’. But what can one make of the idea of God having ‘long experience’, or even of God weighing up possible courses of action and judging appropriately?<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-59" id="footnote-169-59-backlink">59</a></span> There are clear limits to how far this description goes, too – even though, as we shall see below, descriptions of God as wise or good or loving don’t work in quite the same way as the description of God as a rock.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Infinite</span>: This might seem to be a good, abstract word, free from inappropriately material or human associations. But it, too, is a word whose meaning is learnt in particular contexts, as part of particular practices. It is possible, after all, to give a human (social, material) history of the contexts and practices and forms of imagination that have surrounded this word’s emergence and development.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-60" id="footnote-169-60-backlink">60</a></span> If one thinks that the word directly describes some characteristic of God (instead of being, say, a comment upon the inadequacy of all finite descriptions) one will eventually find that it too has smuggled in contraband assumptions or illegal connotations – material that properly belongs only on the creaturely side of the border.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-2">Exercise</p>
				<p class="text">Return to the liturgy that you looked at in preparation for this chapter. Would you now assess differently any of the names or descriptions of God that you found in it?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">God says ‘I am who I am’ and ‘I am the God of your ancestors’ to the same people, at the same time. It is not that one category of people, the idolaters, need to be reminded that God is beyond their false definitions, while another category of people, true witnesses, can be told to rest content with the proper definitions that have made it into their possession. This passage from Isaiah suggests, rather, that there might be an ongoing interplay between the two messages. On the one hand, the Israelites are told, ‘Here is how God has defined Godself’; on the other, they are told, ‘The God who has done this is, and remains, a God who is beyond all definition.’ God makes Godself known – but God cannot be known.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This will seem like a direct contradiction until one realizes that the word ‘know’ has more than one meaning. If, by ‘God can be known’, we mean that God could be grasped and understood, defined and explained, or that human beings could gain intellectual mastery over this subject matter, then Christian theology denies that God can be known even by Christians, even by those to whom God has revealed Godself. God is, in that sense of the word ‘know’, radically and inherently unknowable.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">For Christians, I said in the previous chapter, the word ‘God’ names the source of the life of the Christlike love and justice into which they believe they are being caught up. The relation in which they stand to that source will not be that of knowing subjects facing a known object, able to define it or to gain some kind of intellectual mastery over it. Rather, they will stand as those who are themselves in the process of being mastered by the one they face, and the forms of language appropriate to this will not be calm descriptions or abstract definitions, but expressions of praise, thanksgiving and penitence – language squeezed out of them as they find themselves grasped by God.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The unutterability of God</span></p>
				<p class="text"><span class="bold">‘</span>For if a man cannot look upon the sun, though it be a very small heavenly body, on account of its exceeding heat and power, how shall not a mortal man be much more unable to face the glory of God, which is unutterable?’</p>
				<p class="source">Theophilus of Antioch, <span class="italic">To Autolycus</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-61" id="footnote-169-61-backlink">61</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Consider someone illuminated by a bright light. The light shines on him and on everything around him, and enables him to see himself and his surroundings in new ways, and so to live in new ways in those surroundings. He can see the quality of the light by attending to how it shines on the different surfaces around him, and by paying attention to the way the shadows fall he can learn from where in the sky above him this light streams. In one sense, therefore, he can ‘know’ the source by seeing what and how it illuminates. But if he turns upwards, to face the source itself, the light will be blinding. He won’t be able to see the source itself directly – not so as to see how it works, or how the light is generated in it. The light outstrips the capacity of his eyes, and they become useless, even though the searing blindness that he experiences is itself a sign that he is looking in the right direction. One ancient Christian writer described this as a ‘brilliant darkness’: a light so bright that it is tantamount to blackness.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-62" id="footnote-169-62-backlink">62</a></span> Look directly at it and you can see no more than if you were left wholly in the dark.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This, too, is a metaphor that will only roll so far. Nevertheless, Christian theologians have often stressed that alongside the kind of knowing of God that I discussed in the previous chapter, a proper account of the knowledge of God must include this radical unknowing – this affirmation of the abiding unknowability of the source. ‘No one has ever seen God’ (1 John 4.12; John 1.18); ‘no one shall see me and live’ (Exodus 33.20). And this is no abstract conclusion forced upon Christians by speculative philosophers, denying something that Christians would otherwise have cheerfully affirmed; it is, rather, something that God is believed to have taught and to go on teaching. In the burning bush, in the prophecies of Isaiah, on the cross, God is weaning Christians from forms of knowing that have the nature of God all wrong.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Bridled minds</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘God, indeed, from time to time showed the presence of his divine majesty by definite signs, so that he might be said to be looked upon face to face. But all the signs that he ever gave forth aptly conformed to his plan of teaching and at the same time clearly told men of his incomprehensible essence. For clouds and smoke and flame (Deuteronomy 4.11) although they were symbols of heavenly glory, restrained the minds of all, like a bridle placed on them, from attempting to penetrate too deeply.’</p>
				<p class="source">John Calvin, <span class="italic">Institutes of the Christian Religion</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-63" id="footnote-169-63-backlink">63</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Yet, Christian theologians have affirmed, God does indeed make Godself known. God reveals Godself, and God’s freedom does not trump God’s faithfulness or promise. The knowledge in question is the kind of knowledge that I discussed in the last chapter: the knowing that is like knowing a piece of music; the knowing that consists in participation in what God is doing; the knowing that finds its object most clearly displayed not in an abstract definition but in an ensemble of lives being made holy. The negative declaration of God’s unknowability is nothing more than the declaration that this kind of musical, living, participatory knowledge is the only kind of knowledge of God available. God makes Godself known, and in that very process makes known God’s unknowability outside of this provision. God cannot be known in anything other than the ways in which God makes Godself known.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The question remains, however, whether this form of knowing leaves Christians any kind of speech <span class="italic">about </span>God? Does this kind of knowing allow Christians <span class="italic">any </span>direct description or definition of God’s nature? Perhaps appropriately, in a discussion that focuses on forms of language other than direct, literal description, I am going to begin my answer to that question with an extended parable.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-4"><span class="bold">Acknowledging the sun</span></p>
				<p class="text">There was once a king who sought a counsellor who would understand the workings of the natural world. Many men and women applied for the post, but any appearance of knowledge or wisdom crumbled under his questioning, and he sent each of them away. One day, his servants told him that another applicant had arrived, that she was waiting in the Great Hall – and that she seemed promising. The king quickly made his way there from his chambers and, without any greeting, as soon as he had opened the door, he asked her: ‘Tell me, madam, what is the sun’?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘It is a vast fire, sir, suspended in the emptiness of space.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">His face fell. ‘Well then, tell me more. Is there air in space?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘No, sir, I don’t believe there is. Ah, I see your problem: fires need air to burn, so how can the sun be a fire in airless space?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Quite, quite. And what of fuel?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Fuel, sir?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Yes – fires need fuel. What fuel is burnt by the sun? Where does it come from?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘A good question, sir. I answered hastily – the sun, I meant to say, is <span class="italic">like</span> a vast fire, and we may think of it imaginatively as being “suspended” in space.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘So can you, then, tell me what the sun <span class="italic">really</span> is?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The woman fell quiet for a while, and then looked up at him with a smile. ‘No, sir, I do not know what the sun really is. At least, I cannot <span class="italic">tell</span> you what the sun really is, but—’ she hesitated for a moment, and then continued, ‘I can show you. Would you come with me, sir, over to the balcony?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">He was sufficiently intrigued to walk with her through the doors that opened on the East side of the room, onto the hall balcony. He glanced up at the morning sun, trying to glimpse something of its true nature – but as always the glance half-blinded him: he did not see the sun so much as the dancing spots that the glare left in his eyes. ‘I can barely look at it, madam – and the same is true of you, I suspect.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Of course, sir, but that is not what I meant. Staring at the sun will not answer your questions about it. But you can feel its warmth, can’t you?’ He could, even through the breeze. ‘And look out at your kingdom, sir: you may not be able to look at the sun, but the sun enables you to look at all this. That’s what the sun is: the source of the warmth on your skin, and the light by which you see the world. You may not be able to know the nature of the sun directly, but you can know yourself and your world as bathed in its light.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">His grunt might have indicated approval, but after a moment he said, ‘Very good, madam – but that is not enough. Anyone can feel that warmth and see in that light. I’ve been hoping to find an <span class="italic">expert</span>, someone who can tell me the sun’s secrets. I was hoping you might be such an expert.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘No, sir, not me.’ She paused again, and then continued, ‘but I do know where to find such experts. Look over there, and tell me what you see.’ She pointed out at the landscape spread below them. He looked, and saw nothing but the spreading fields and his people at work on them. He frowned. ‘Who out there is an expert on the sun, madam? Don’t play games!’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Over there, sir – those people in the fields. They work every day under the sun, and know what it feels like in every season. They work every day <span class="italic">with</span> the sun, and know when to plant and when to harvest, when to work in the fields, and when to stay in the shade, how to cover their heads to keep themselves cool, and how to treat themselves if they get burnt. If you want to know what the sun is, look at them. Or, better, go out there in the fields with them and start learning its ways. You won’t necessarily find any new words for the sun in that way – you may still only be able to call it a vast fire hanging in space, knowing all the while that those words are inadequate – but you <span class="italic">will</span> know the sun, nonetheless.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The king thought for a while, caught between a feeling that he was being cheated of a real answer to his question, and a building admiration for her response. After a minute or two staring down at the baked fields, he spoke again. ‘But is there nothing you can say directly about the sun – no description that you can offer me that is not pictorial and inadequate?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Well, yes, in a way. I have already done so, have I not, by describing what the sun is <span class="italic">not</span>. It may be <span class="italic">like</span> a fire, but as you demonstrated a moment ago we know quite firmly and clearly that it is not a fire in any sense we understand. More positively, though, I suppose we could also say quite firmly that the sun is the source of the heat and light that you feel and see with, and that those people are working with. That is a direct statement about the sun, even if we don’t know <span class="italic">how</span> the sun is the source of these things.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Yes, yes – but the first is knowledge of what the sun is not, rather than knowledge of what the sun is.’ He paused, and then continued, ‘And the second does not really add anything to what you said before: it simply repeats your claim that the people in the field know the sun. Or rather, it gives the name “sun” to what the people in the field know. It is really a statement about their knowing of the sun, isn’t it, not a statement that tells me directly what the sun is. Is there nothing else you can offer me?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">When she spoke again, it was with a half smile: ‘Yes, sir, I have one more thing. Though I do not think it will satisfy you. The people down there in the fields tell all sorts of stories about the sun: that it is a golden apple thrown each morning by an imprisoned hero to his no-less imprisoned heroine; that it is a boat sailing across the sea with a burning sail; that it is – yes – a huge fire lit by the Gods to warm the earth, but that the demons sometimes steal the fuel and sometimes pile too much back on, trying to freeze or burn the earth. They don’t seem to mind that the stories contradict one another. But those stories, sir, are important: they are part of the way in which those people <span class="italic">learn</span> how to live with the sun; they shape their imaginations, and so shape their actions. Because of those stories, people do know the sun not only in what they do, but in what they think and say, and their knowledge is true knowledge, sir, even if their words and stories are not ones that we could claim speak directly of the sun.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Will that do, sir?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The king paused before answering. He was still not satisfied: these were not the kinds of answers he had been hoping for. But he could not think of another way of asking his question, and in any case was now too distracted by the thought that he had no idea what salary it was appropriate to pay to this woman once he appointed her.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-5"><span class="bold">Pragmatic, propositional and imaginative</span></p>
				<p class="text">In this parable, the prospective counsellor offers the king three ways of speaking about the sun. Those three ways are analogous to three kinds of Christian talk about God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The first kind of talk I call ‘pragmatic’ because it is focused on <span class="italic">activity</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-64" id="footnote-169-64-backlink">64</a></span> The prospective counsellor explains to the king that although she cannot tell him directly about the sun, the workers in the field do know about it – and their knowledge is shown in the patterns of their activity, the shape of their lives. She only gives the sketchiest possible outline of the sort of thing she means – they ‘know when to plant and when to harvest, when to work in the fields, and when to stay in the shade’ – but if she had wanted to tell the king in more detail what the workers know about the sun, she could have done so by describing their lives, their practices, in more detail. And that is what I mean by ‘pragmatic’ language: the kind of theological description that, as a way of speaking indirectly about God, speaks about the shape and texture of lives that <span class="italic">respond</span> to God. Christian theology can speak about the patterns of Christian life – of prayer, of worship, of mission, of reading, of relating – with the conviction that God is the reality to which that patterned life is a response. In the previous chapter, this was what I was suggesting: I was refusing to talk too directly and independently about God’s love, and instead saying that one must attend to lives that have been and are lived in response to that love. Such lives, I said, are the best, the most direct language about God that Christians have: God is known in the lives of all those individuals and communities who have heard the call of God, who have begun to learn Christlike love and justice, and who therefore display the identity of God. Pragmatic <span class="italic">description</span> of such lives is therefore the best, most direct way that a theologian’s words can speak about God. Everything else is commentary.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Cultural-linguistic theology</span></p>
				<p class="text">The American theologian George Lindbeck has suggested that Christians be thought of as analogous to a people who have a distinctive culture, and who speak a distinctive language. Think of an anthropologist visiting a remote island tribe whose language and culture are uncharted. The theologian’s job, Lindbeck suggested, is like the job of this anthropologist: he must get to know this people’s culture and language, trying to reach the point where he can understand both the language and the patterns and rules that govern the culture in which that language is embedded – discerning the cultural as well as the linguistic ‘grammar’ that shapes this people’s life. Doctrines, for Lindbeck, are not primarily statements of theories about God’s nature; they are ways of stating some of the rules by which this people governs its behaviour. It is only, he says, the lives that are governed by these doctrinal rules that should be thought of as making a claim about the nature of God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-65" id="footnote-169-65-backlink">65</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The second kind of language I am calling ‘imaginative’. The prospective counsellor referred to the stories and metaphors that enable the workers in the field to pass on their understanding of life in the sun. This richly varied, extravagantly imaginative language is not mere decoration that could be abandoned without real loss to the substance of their understanding; it is a necessary part of how their understanding is shaped. In fact, the use of this imaginative language is one of the practices by which they relate to the sun: it is one of the practices that pragmatic language about them will describe. A pragmatic description will focus on <span class="italic">their saying</span> of these things, and the role taken by that saying in the overall shape of their lives. The imaginative language itself is the <span class="italic">content</span> of what they say: the stories and images and metaphors and parables that place in a communal store their wisdom about the sun.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The case with Christian language about God is similar. Christianity boasts a lush and extravagant growth of imaginative language about God. Such language is not dispensable; it is not mere decoration, or a sop for the hard of thinking. It shapes the imaginations of those who use it, and so shapes the lives that they live – and so it plays an indispensable role in sustaining and shaping the way that their lives respond to God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Human beings are, after all, imaginative creatures, and inhabit the world by imagination. To be active in the world requires us to see the stuff around us not simply as a bewildering variety of pure sense-impressions, but to see it as a world of objects or circumstances with which we can interact. This ‘seeing as’ is a matter of imagination, and that imagination is shaped by metaphors and parables and stories more powerfully than by apparently direct, literal description. Staring in front of me now, I see a patch of grey with a strange, luminous patch of blue within it, and within the patch of blue a white rectangle speckled with black marks. Or rather, that’s not what I see, unless I take my glasses off: I actually see a computer monitor, with a blue desktop pictured on it, and a white document on that desktop, covered with writing. I see it, in other words, as something I can understand and work with – as containing possibilities for action. My ability to see it in this way, and so my ability to engage with it, is shaped by my having learnt various metaphors, similes and stories: I see the blue desktop as being <span class="italic">like</span> a physical desktop, a space on which I can arrange my work; I see the white patch <span class="italic">as</span> a piece of paper on which I am typing – and so on.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-66" id="footnote-169-66-backlink">66</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">In just the same way, one could think, for instance, of Rowan Williams speaking of God loving ‘the reflection of his love within creation; he cannot bear to be separated from it and goes eagerly in search of it, hungry to find in the created “other” the reality of his own life and bliss’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-67" id="footnote-169-67-backlink">67</a></span> Eagerness, hunger, inability to bear separation – these are words fit for finite human lives, words that are clearly inadequate when applied to God; and yet this inadequate, extravagant image is one that enables the reader to see the love of God in a new light, and so to respond to it and live with it in a new way. By making possible a richer lived response to God, it enables truer reference to God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-68" id="footnote-169-68-backlink">68</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">The third kind of language I am calling propositional.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-69" id="footnote-169-69-backlink">69</a></span> It is the kind of language that tries to set down in unambiguous language clear statements of fact about God. Its statements can then be subjected to careful logical analysis to see what does and what does not follow from them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You will have noticed – and, after the last chapter probably not have been surprised – that the prospective counsellor is rather evasive about using this kind of language. There <span class="italic">are</span> direct statements in what she says, however, and they <span class="italic">are</span> direct statements that say something about the sun. What she says is, in fact, full of such statements.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the one hand, she makes clear claims about what the sun is <span class="italic">not</span>, saying for example that ‘it is not a fire in any sense we understand’. Yet she uses such language to ensure that the king will not be tempted to look for the wrong kind of statement about the sun. Her propositional statements both warn against thinking that there are direct, positive ways of speaking about the sun, and warn against taking imaginative language as if it were literal description. Nevertheless these statements do convey something, however indirectly, about the sun itself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, she spends a lot of time making the more positive claim that the king himself in minor ways, and the workers in the fields in richer and more complex ways, are genuinely responding to the sun. Her explanation of that is full of direct statements: she says things like, ‘the sun <span class="italic">is</span> the source of the heat and light that you feel and see with, and that those people are working with’. As the king points out, however, what she says simply ‘gives the name “sun” to what the people in the field know, and it is really a statement about their knowing of the sun … not a statement that tells me directly what the sun is’. Even though her propositional statements do make claims about the sun, and do so quite definitely and in one sense informatively, the claims are once again made indirectly.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You may recognize some of what I said in the last chapter and earlier in this as belonging squarely in this propositional camp. Most obviously, there was my claim that ‘God’ is the name of the source of the Christlike love and justice that flows through people’s lives. That is a positive propositional claim, and it is definitely a claim about God, but it is not itself a direct description of God. It is a statement about <span class="italic">where one can find</span> something like a description of God: look to the lives of those caught up in God’s life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, there is my negative propositional claim that God’s own love is beyond human imagination and understanding, like the sun whose light we can see when it shines on the world around us, but which blinds us when we look towards it. That is equally clearly a kind of claim about God, but it is a negative one: it says who or what God is by denying that one’s normal ways of naming and understanding realities in the world work in God’s case.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In the kind of theology I am exploring in this book, propositional language is most at home in these indirect modes, talking about God by explaining why in God’s case one should not look to one’s normal ways of grasping and explaining reality but instead should look elsewhere – to the lives described in pragmatic language and to the imaginative language employed in those lives.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Propositionalism</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Some theologians, of course, believe that propositional claims can do a great deal more than this. They hold that it is possible to speak much more directly and much more fully about the nature of God’s life in a propositional idiom, setting down clear definitional statements about who and what God is. The philosophical theologian Richard Swinburne, for instance, at the start of his book on <span class="italic">The Existence of God</span>, states:</p>
				<p class="text">I take the proposition ‘God exists’ (and the equivalent proposition ‘There is a God’) to be logically equivalent to ‘there exists necessarily a person without a body (i.e., a spirit) who necessarily is eternal, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and the creator of all things.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-70" id="footnote-169-70-backlink">70</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Chapter 2 has already shown what I think of this. I believe it makes better Christian sense to see this kind of apparently direct, positive claim about God as in fact a commentary upon or summary of that deeper Christian knowledge of the love of God that is found in Christian lives.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Let me give an example. If Swinburne is asked to expand on what he means by ‘omnipotent’, he says:</p>
				<p class="quotes">By God’s being omnipotent, I understand that he is able to do whatever it is logically possible (i.e., coherent to suppose) that he can do.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-71" id="footnote-169-71-backlink">71</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Later in this book (in Chapter 10), when I expand on what I think ‘omnipotent’ means, I say:</p>
				<p class="quotes">If I say, for instance, that ‘God is omnipotent’, I won’t understand what that means by trying to come up with an abstract definition, and then arguing about what God must be able to do. I will discover what those words mean as I learn what it means to live with the trust that there is no situation in which God’s love fails, no reality or extremity in which God’s love is extinguished or finally defeated.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">That is, I take this sort of apparently direct, positive proposition ‘God is omnipotent’ as no more than a convenient shorthand for something more complex: a ‘pragmatic’ description of a pattern of Christian life and imagination, coupled with the propositional claim that this aspect of Christian life truly ‘responds’ to God. To treat it as a straightforward definitional claim as Swinburne does is, I believe, to mistake the kind of knowing of God that is available to human beings.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">So, there are at least three different kinds of language at work in Christian theology: pragmatic, imaginative and propositional. Pragmatic language describes lives; imaginative describes the imaginations of the people living those lives; and propositional claims comment on the other two, making direct claims about what those lives and imaginations amount to.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-7"><span class="bold">Immanence and economy</span></p>
				<p class="text">One day, when the new counsellor was dining with the king, she reminded him of their conversation about the sun. ‘Sir’, she said, ‘I have been thinking further about our knowledge of the sun. I wrote a letter to an astronomer I know – a man who spends all his time either observing the stars and planets, or developing mathematical models of how they move. He suggested a distinction that I had not thought of before.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘What distinction is that?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Well, think about the workers in the field, and all the things they know about the sun.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Yes, yes: they know about its heat, its light, the patterns of its rising and falling, the changes in its strength throughout the year. We discussed all this.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Well, sir, my astronomer friend pointed out that not everything they know is of the same kind. The heat that they know, for instance, is truly the heat of the sun – even if they can have no idea of how the sun produces that heat, or what the heat of the sun itself is like all the way up at the sun itself. Even though the bearable heat that they feel, live with and respond to is very different from the unimaginable fire of the sun’s own heat, they are right to think that the sun itself is, in some sense, hot – and to understand that hotness by analogy with the heat they themselves feel.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘You do like making things complicated, don’t you. I think I understand so far, though. Carry on!’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘He pointed out, sir, that many of the other things that the people know work rather differently. Take the rising and setting of the sun, for instance. The sun itself does not rise and set; it is thanks to the turning of our world that we experience the sun as rising and setting. Or the strengthening and weakening of the sun over the seasons: that has, he says, to do both with the tilt of our world’s axis, which means that the sun’s path through our skies is at some times of the year more directly overhead than at other times; and it has to do with the path that our world takes around the sun, sometimes closer to the sun and sometimes further away.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘I see your meaning. These things that the people know, they are facts about how we and our world relate to the sun, and not facts about the sun itself? Yes, yes, I see that. Sunset, sunrise, the seasons. Of course the sun itself does not move up and down; it does not grow hotter in summer and cooler in winter – it is constant. But, yes, the path that we take around it is so arranged that we experience it in these changing ways.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Yes, sir.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Ah, but has your astronomer friend noted that we take that path <span class="italic">because</span> of the sun, though? If I understand these matters aright, our world is held on its path around the sun <span class="italic">by</span> the sun. The movement we have that makes us experience the sun as rising and setting, strengthening and weakening, is a movement arranged by the sun, a movement the sun has given us?’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Very good sir! I had not thought of that. I will write to him again at once.’ She had learnt already that, even with this genial monarch, a little flattery now and then was a sensible precaution. After all, she did not want the sun to set any time soon on her position as counsellor.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This story can help us to make an important distinction, between claims about the sun as it is experienced in the lives of the people and claims about the sun as it is in itself. On the one hand, there are what we call ‘economic’ claims, not because they have anything to do with any financial arrangements, but because of an older sense of the word ‘economy’. It comes from the Greek words <span class="italic">oikos</span>, meaning household, and <span class="italic">nomos</span>, meaning law, and could refer to the way someone puts their domestic affairs in order, the way that someone makes provision for his or her family. So ‘economic’ claims are, in this context, those that focus on the patterns into which the sun has arranged the lives of those who respond to it. How does the sun appear to those people, and how is the nature of the sun seen in the way that their lives are arranged?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">On the other hand, there are ‘immanent’ claims. They are claims about what the sun itself is truly like, regardless of the position of the people making the claims. Immanent comes from the Latin <span class="italic">immanere</span>, to dwell or remain within, and can mean both ‘indwelling’ and ‘inherent’. Here it is the latter that is in view: what properties are really <span class="italic">inherent</span> in the sun? What properties dwell not in the relationship between sun and observer, but in the sun itself?</p>

								<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The ambiguity of immanence</span></p>
								<p class="text">There are two different uses of the word ‘immanent’ in theology, and they should not be confused. On the one hand, there is the usage I am sketching at the moment: ‘immanent’ is used in contrast to ‘economic’ to speak about what is true of God in and for Godself. On the other hand, ‘immanent’ can also be used in contrast to ‘transcendent’ to talk about God’s presence in and to God’s creation – God’s closeness or intimacy to the world. It is particularly important not to confuse these two meanings as they are almost direct opposites, one having to do with God considered in abstraction from any relationship to the world, the other having to do precisely with the intimate quality of that relationship.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In my story, claims about the heat of the sun are both economic and immanent. On the economic side the heat of the sun is something that the people experience, that they know and work with in their daily lives. Yet on the immanent side the astronomer claims that the people experience this heat from the sun because the sun <span class="italic">is itself hot</span>. The heat that the people experience and the heat that the sun has in itself might be of vastly different orders of magnitude, and the sun’s inherent heat might be impossible to imagine properly (no one, after all, could ever experience it because to experience it would be to die); nevertheless, the two are intimately connected. The sun’s immanent heat produces the economic heat that the people feel, and because of that connection, the economic claim that the sun <span class="italic">feels</span> hot can become the immanent claim that the sun <span class="italic">is</span> hot.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Claims about the sun rising and setting, however, are only economic. The people can rightly claim that the sun rises and sets – but what they are talking about is <span class="italic">only</span> the sun-as-seen-from-their-vantage-point, the sun-as-they-experience-it. The economic claim ‘the sun rises and sets <span class="italic">for us</span>’ cannot be turned into the immanent claim ‘the sun itself inherently rises and sets’. Someone who lived not on a rotating planet but on a planet that always turned the same face towards the sun would not experience the sun as rising and setting: it would be a constant presence, always in the same quarter of their sky.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Alongside this talk about the sun that is only economic, and alongside the talk that is both economic and immanent, could one have talk that is only immanent? That is, could one have talk about what the sun is inherently like that was not at the same time talk about some aspect of how the sun appears in human lives? One might think, perhaps, of the theories of the astrophysicists, which declare that the sun has an inner core taking up about one fifth of its diameter, that this core has a density of some 150,000 kilograms per cubic metre, and that it is powered by a fusion reaction that converts hydrogen to helium. Even these, of course, are claims based on empirical data, and so claims that have their roots in some rather refined aspects of how the sun appears in our lives. The chains of analysis and disciplined speculation involved in developing these claims from that data are so long and tangled, however, that there remains very little direct sense in which claims about the size, density and nature of the sun’s core are also claims about how we relate to and experience the sun. The economic base of these claims has been left so far behind that they have almost achieved pure immanence.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, no one uses the words ‘immanent’ and ‘economic’ when talking about the sun: they are theological terms used when talking about God. ‘Economic’ refers to God’s ‘economy of salvation’ – the arrangements that God has made for God’s world, and the knowledge that God’s people have in that economy of who God is <span class="italic">for them</span>: how God appears to them, from their vantage point (a position or vantage point that God has given them). ‘Immanent’, on the other hand, refers to what God is in Godself; God’s inner or essential nature – what God is like not just when seen from one particular vantage point, but absolutely.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On page 58, I asked whether Christian theology allows any kind of direct description or definition of God’s nature. I can now rephrase that question. Most of what I said in the last chapter was focused on the <span class="italic">economic</span> level, in that it had to do with who God appears to be in the lives of believers, or how the lives of believers constitute a kind of claim about who God is <span class="italic">for us</span>. I have also, in that chapter and this, been insisting on the unknowability of God – that is, the idea that direct, clear statements about God’s nature are deeply problematic. In other words, I have been denying that God’s <span class="italic">immanent</span> life is a reality that one can easily or straightforwardly talk about. So, the question that faces us now is, ‘Does Christian theology allow one to say anything about who God is <span class="italic">immanently</span> – or does it abandon the attempt, and allow God’s immanent life to remain wholly swathed in mystery?’ I may say, economically, that to learn to know God is to learn to know oneself and one’s world as bathed in God’s love, and that to know God is to learn to recognize oneself and one’s world as called to participate in that love. But can I go further, and say that God <span class="italic">is</span> love, immanently – that this love characterizes God’s essential nature?</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-8"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">In theology, ‘economic’ description of God refers to God as he is experienced, learnt and responded to by Christians caught up in the ‘economy of salvation’.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">God’s ‘immanent’ life is what God is in Godself.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-9"><span class="bold">Analogical language</span></p>
				<p class="text">Imagine that you have a CD player with one of those graphic displays on which there are several columns of coloured lights showing you the levels of sound being put out at different frequencies. Imagine that you have such a CD player in front of you, but that the speakers are disconnected, so that no sound is audible. Imagine that there is a CD in the player, and that you have pressed ‘play’. No sound comes out, but the display is working, so you see the various columns of lights pulsating up and down, sometimes staying quite low and green, sometimes becoming taller and acquiring red tops.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, you have a CD player equipped with visualization equipment, and what you see on that equipment has to do in general with that equipment’s features, its connections and components. But what you see when this specific music CD is played is what happens when the connections and components of this equipment are taken up and used by this music: the music conforms this equipment to itself, and makes this utterly unmusical equipment (equipment that plays lights, not sounds) communicate something of the music.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You could describe the visual display that this equipment produces using words appropriate to the visual world: ‘This bit of the music is very tall; this bit has lots of red; in this bit the column tops slope down to the right, in this bit they slope to the left; in this bit the whole thing is very jumbled up. …’ These are the spatial, visual words appropriate to the visual display, and they are not musical words as such; they don’t tell us directly about the music (unlike words like ‘loud’ or ‘quiet’ or ‘rumbling’ or ‘deep’). These visual words are adequate to the visual display, but they are decidedly inadequate as descriptions of the music: what would it mean to say that music was tall, red or sloped? Were you finally to connect the speakers, the music you would hear would utterly exceed this visual language that you have now developed for it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And yet, because the graphical display is a faithful representation of the music, the description that you offer of it can, in a way, be <span class="italic">true</span> of the music. It is capable of getting hold of something real about the music; there is some feature of the music, some real feature, that corresponds to each of the words that you use to describe the display. When the columns are taller on the right than on the left, that does mean <span class="italic">something</span> about the music. When there is a lot of red on the screen, that does mean something too.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Something a little like that is going on in the move from description of the economy of salvation to claims about the immanent nature of God. A Christian can attend to and describe the patterns of the economy – the processes in history and in her life by which she believes God has addressed the world and begun to draw it into that love and justice which are God’s life. She can speak and think about this economy using the pragmatic and imaginative language appropriate to it: language appropriate to a sequence of events and relationships lived out in time; language appropriate to human imaginations.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">She can, however, believe that this economy is like the pulsating of the CD player’s lights: it is a faithful transcription of the melody of God’s immanent life, a transcription that is true to that life, even though it is a transcription for a medium utterly different from that life. This transcription does not make the immanent life of God fully knowable and graspable, any more than flashing lights let one hear a CD’s music – but it does make possible some kind of true knowledge of that life. The full, unimaginable reality of the immanent life of God exceeds the economy just as surely as the music of Beethoven pouring out of the speakers would exceed the lines of green and red lights winking on and off on the front of a CD player – but she can claim that the immanent nature of God, while remaining utterly beyond her, is nevertheless truly given to her in the economy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This picture of Christian speech about God suggests that one can arrive at a description that is in some sense true of God, even if the reality that one is describing so far exceeds one’s ability to describe it that one cannot know <span class="italic">how</span> one’s description is true. This is called ‘analogical’ speech: it works on the basis that there is an <span class="italic">analogy</span> or similarity between what one says using frail human words and God’s immanent life, even though any such similarity is qualified by a still greater dissimilarity: the dissimilarity between God’s life and the life of the world. The heat of the sun that I feel is analogous to the heat of the sun itself, even though the heat of the sun itself is not something I could possibly imagine: it exceeds the limits of what could be experienced by bodies like mine.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On reflection, this might seem a rather useless claim. Of what use is a true description of God if one cannot know what it means for it to be true – if the reality to which it points remains ungraspable? Christian theologians have replied that such description can be of use precisely because the primary purpose of one’s talk about God is not the development of accurate description, nor the provision of explanatory theories or models of God. Christian talk <span class="italic">about</span> God is an ingredient in the processes by which Christian lives are conformed <span class="italic">to</span> God. The claim that Christian speech about God can, despite God’s unknowability, be analogically true speech about God’s immanent nature is simply one aspect of the broader claim that Christian <span class="italic">life</span> in response to God can, despite God’s unknowability, be life that is truly being drawn to share in its own way in the immanent life of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The claim, as it were, is that the visual display is genuinely plugged into the music, such that someone whose attention and language is kept in conformity to that display is himself (in a sense) plugged into that music. Similarly, by the grace of God’s action in the economy of salvation, Christian language can be genuinely plugged in to the music of God’s immanent life, and so Christian life that is guided and shaped by this language can be genuinely plugged in to that divine music.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The kind of knowledge of God available to human beings, according to this theology, is not primarily a matter of accurate description or convincing explanation: it is primarily a matter of lives caught up to share in God’s life. But within that kind of knowing-by-living there can, nevertheless, be a certain kind of theoretical knowing, a certain kind of ability to describe God, a certain kind of ability to speak the truth <span class="italic">about</span> God – a way of speaking that, even though it is limited and inadequate, can be meaningfully claimed to be true.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-10"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christian theologians have claimed that the economy of salvation is a transcription into creaturely terms of God’s immanent life.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">They have claimed that to be caught up in this economy is therefore, in a sense, to participate in the immanent life of God.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">They have also claimed that the speech about God that the economy makes possible can be true speech about God’s immanent nature.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Such speech is true only analogically, however, and believers cannot know <span class="italic">how</span> what they say applies to God.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-11"><span class="bold">Love all the way</span></p>
				<p class="text">Why should it be important to make this claim? Once the distinction between ‘economic’ and ‘immanent’ has been made – the distinction between God as God is in Godself, and God as God appears to or engages with the world – why should anyone insist that Christian response to God, Christian life in relation to God, somehow connects with or shares in the <span class="italic">immanent</span> life of God?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As my parable about the sun suggests, to say that some claim about God is purely economic would be to suggest that what one sees of God from this vantage point might change were one to move to another vantage point. That is, to say that something is purely economic would be to say that, in principle, one could be in some time or place or situation or state from which that something would not be true of God – just as one could be on a planet from which the sun could be seen not to rise and set.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To insist that the claim that ‘God is love’ is not simply economic, but applies analogically to God’s immanent life, is to claim that there is no imaginable vantage point from which God will not be seen to be love. There is no place that one could go to, no time at which one could arrive, no situation in which one could find oneself, in which God would be anything other than love. God is love all the way down.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">That may sound like the kind of statement that nobody could disagree with. Yet if you think back to the previous chapter (or if you read on into the next), you will remember that, for Christian theology, the true meaning of love is found in Jesus of Nazareth. For a Christian theologian, to say that God is love all the way down is to say that God is <span class="italic">Christlike</span> all the way down. ‘God is Christlike and in him there is no unChristlikeness at all’, as the twentieth-century Anglican theologian Michael Ramsey said.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-72" id="footnote-169-72-backlink">72</a></span> God, according to Christian theology, is <span class="italic">immanently</span> Christlike.</p>

								<p class="text">There is another reason for insisting on the link between an economic understanding of God and God’s immanent life. It is that link that ensures that the understanding of God found among ordinary believers – the workers in the fields, who know how to live with and respond to God’s love – is a knowledge that gets to the heart of who God is. There is not some different kind of knowledge available only to theological experts who have got beyond the economic level, a knowledge that leaves behind the naive level of ordinary believers and grapples with the <span class="italic">real</span> nature of God. The love of God that ordinary people know goes all the way down, and the only ‘experts’ are those who know most deeply that they are loved, and love most deeply themselves. Those are forms of knowledge that do not necessarily go with academic prowess or ecclesiastical preferment.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">To insist that God is love, that God is Christlike, ‘all the way down’ – that to learn at Christ’s hands the love of God is to learn the immanent heart of God – is to believe that one need have no hesitation about making a lifelong commitment to this way of learning God. This is a pathway, Christians trust, that goes all the way into the heart of God, and travellers along this path will never reach a time or a place where it peters out and leaves them stranded. To bind oneself to this pathway, to make the lifelong investment of time and energy and attention that is involved in taking it with utmost seriousness, is not to keep oneself to the economic shallows: it leads on, Christians believe, into the immanent depths.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-12"><span class="bold">Key point</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">To claim that God makes God’s immanent life known in the economy is to claim that what Christians learn about God in the economy can be trusted in all times and places.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-8-13"><span class="bold">The analogy of love</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In the light of all this, I can say more precisely what is going on when Christians make the statement, ‘God is love.’</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">In the first place, ‘love’ is a word that people learn in the midst of finitude – by being loved by parents or carers, by reading love stories, by falling in love, by loving their children, by living their lives. There is no one definition of ‘love’ that captures all of these; rather, people learn to use the word ‘love’ differently, but more or less appropriately, in each of a kaleidoscope of human activities, situations and relationships. The uses of the word ‘love’ that people learn are not simply ‘univocal’ (all meaning exactly the same thing); neither are they simply ‘equivocal’ (meaning several completely unconnected things). They are, rather, ‘analogous’: connected by various degrees of resemblance. ‘Love’ is already a stretchy word.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">To say ‘God is love’ is to attempt to say something about God’s immanent life. But to apply this word to God is to stretch it far beyond its ordinary limits – unless one starts imagining that God is simply a big version of a human being, with emotions and understanding and commitments that work in much the same way that ours do. Christians are certainly called by God’s economy of salvation to imagine God as the one who loves the world passionately and consumingly, who is so given over to love that there is nothing in God that is not love. And yet they are also called to imagine one who loves purely – that is, one who loves without selfishness, without particular interests, without an ego that is fed or advanced by this love. So although Christians have certainly said that ‘God is love’, and have normally regarded themselves as saying something about God’s immanent life when they do so, theologians have traditionally argued that Christians do not (and cannot) know quite <span class="italic">what</span> they are saying when they do so; they cannot imagine quite how love works in the case of God.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Nevertheless, Christians are committed to using this word of God because of what God has done – loving them in Jesus of Nazareth, and beginning to draw them into Christlike love. That is something that they can grasp; it happened and happens in the finite world of people and things, which is the very world for which their words are suited. So Christians say ‘God is love’, not because they can imagine or define exactly how it is true – not because they can imagine or define exactly the God who is loving – but because they trust God as the ineffable source of the love that encounters them in Christ, and catches them up into itself.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Learning to say ‘God is love’ is therefore inseparable from the process by which Christians are taught what true love is by being loved truly. The love shown to them in Christ is not, they believe, simply one more example of love to set alongside all the others. It is <span class="italic">the</span> example of love – and learning to recognize oneself and the world around one as loved by this love begins to change one’s understanding of (and so practice of) love. This is a love that one learns by learning to become loving.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Christian theologians have therefore affirmed that there is a sense in which ‘love’ is a word used <span class="italic">most</span> properly of God (even though they cannot know how love works in God’s case). God is the source of perfect love, and God’s love is the criterion for all human love. All a person’s finite and imperfect loves are therefore given a standard outside themselves: they are called to account before God’s love. To say ‘God is love’ is therefore inseparably bound up with the critique of all one’s other ways of using the word ‘love’ – both the ways in which one has personally learnt (and sometimes mis-learnt) how to love, and the ways in which one’s culture enshrines various ideas and confusions about love.</li>
				</ol>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Love in culture</span></p>
				<p class="text">Learning the meaning of love involves a journey into the resources and problems of our culture. We are surrounded by images of love in books and films and television programmes and adverts and posters and songs. Some of them are good and some of them are dreadful; some of them are profound, and some of them have – to use a wonderful phrase from J. K. Rowling – ‘the emotional range of a teaspoon’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-73" id="footnote-169-73-backlink">73</a></span> The journey on which Christians learn what ‘love’ means is a journey into discernment about all these images – a slow learning to differentiate between the help and the hindrance that each can offer. The field of ‘theology and culture’ (theological explorations of films and novels and television programmes and computer games) is not, as is sometimes suggested, a less-than-serious distraction from the real business of theology: it is an unavoidable part of learning the meaning of the word ‘God’.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The statement ‘God is love’ certainly looks like a direct propositional statement about God. And to a certain extent, it does work like one: it conveys a kind of true information about God. But if my analysis of the nature of this analogical claim is right, it is not a statement that can be extricated from the Christian lives and imaginations that are its context. The claim ‘God is love’ cannot be separated from the kinds of reality spoken of in pragmatic and imaginative Christian language. This is a statement about God’s immanent life only because it remains a commentary upon that economic reality.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Communicable and incommunicable</span></p>
				<p class="text">Traditionally, a distinction has been made between ‘communicable’ and ‘incommunicable’ attributes of God. Love is a classic communicable attribute: as I have been emphasizing, it is an attribute that can in some sense be shared by God’s creatures. The same would be true for wisdom, justice, faithfulness and goodness, among many others; all of these work in the same way that I have been suggesting ‘love’ works. On the other hand, an incommunicable attribute would be something like ‘omnipresence’ – an attribute that can’t be shared by God’s creatures. That does not mean that to speak of God as omnipresent is somehow to capture God more directly. God’s omnipresence is just as thoroughly unimaginable as God’s love, and claims about that omnipresence are no less bound up with Christian lives and imagination. To say that ‘God is omnipresent’ is best thought of as a commentary upon Christian lives lived in the faith that there is nowhere one can go to evade God’s presence, nowhere one can find oneself where God’s love is not at work. There may be no meaningful sense in which Christians are called to become omnipresent themselves,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-74" id="footnote-169-74-backlink">74</a></span> but even an incommunicable attribute like this is something that is best understood by looking to the patterns of Christian life.</p>
