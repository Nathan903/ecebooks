				<p class="text">Back in Chapter 1, I suggested that theology emerged as Christian communities tried to make sense of their lives, but until now I have concentrated on sketching the context or backdrop against which Christians believe that their communities’ lives are played out: the nature of the God that these communities worship, the texture of the world within which they live, the shape of the salvation in which they believe themselves caught up. In this chapter, however, I finally turn to those communities themselves, and reach ‘ecclesiology’, or the doctrine of the Church. What is the Church? Why do Christians gather together? What do they do? What are their communities and meetings and institutions <span class="italic">for</span>? In the present chapter I will explore two of the central themes of ecclesiology: worship and unity, before turning to two more (apostolicity and holiness) in the next.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-1"><span class="bold">Any given Sunday</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">Last Sunday morning, I went with my wife and two small children (Bridget aged three and Tom aged one) to a large fifteenth-century granite church that dominates a small village on the edge of Dartmoor. We arrived just as the service was about to begin, were each handed a hymn book and a service sheet at the door, and then sat right at the back so that Bridget and Tom would have easy access to the children’s play area (crayons and paper, lots of children’s books, some cuddly toys, some Sticklebricks). We took little notice of the familiar surroundings: the stone font standing near us, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century stained-glass windows, the plaque with a memorial to those from the village who died in the World Wars, the grave slabs set into the floor and other monuments round the wall, the pulpit, the wooden screen partially separating the chancel from the nave, the communion table in the chancel with a chalice and candles set on it, the pipe organ on one side of the chancel, the piano, the tower behind us with bell-ropes just visible in the loft, the modern white cross hanging in front of the tower. There were perhaps 25 people in this barn of a building, most of them older than us, many of them retired, all sitting in wooden pews facing the chancel. At the division between chancel and nave, a robed vicar stood to lead the service, except when he climbed up to the pulpit to deliver the sermon. We sang a selection of hymns accompanied by the organ; we heard and said various parts of the Anglican liturgy for Holy Communion; we listened to readings from the Bible and heard a brief sermon from the vicar expounding one of those readings. At least, we tried to do all those things, but were often distracted as we tried to keep Bridget and Tom amused and relatively quiet, making sure that they didn’t use the crayons on anything other than the colouring sheets, and administering snacks (rather than smacks) when other amusements ceased to attract. When the liturgy reached the relevant point, the four of us joined the queue of people walking to the altar rail at the front of the church, Tom toddling confidently but unpredictably by my side. We knelt, and the vicar said a prayer of blessing for each child, and gave each of us adults a communion wafer; his assistant gave each of us a sip of red wine. After the service was over, we chatted to friends in the congregation about this and that, the affairs of the week, news from the village; we picked up the scattered books and crayons, and then made our way home.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What has any of that to do with the theology that I have been exploring in this book so far? Or what has that theology to do with any of the very different experiences of Church that countless millions of people around the world had on the same day – from ornate and dramatic celebrations of High Mass to the silence of Quaker meetings, from mega-churches holding tens of thousands to rooms with just two or three, from churches that are part of some ancient denomination to unaffiliated house churches and informal groups, from vast stone cathedrals to tiny tin huts?</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-3"><span class="bold">Marks of the Church</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In one part of the liturgy during last Sunday’s service, my wife and I joined with the rest of the congregation to say the Nicene Creed. The third main section of that creed runs:</p>
				<p class="quotes">We believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
				<p class="quotes">the Lord, the giver of life,</p>
				<p class="quotes">who proceeds from the Father and the Son,</p>
				<p class="quotes">who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified,</p>
				<p class="quotes">who has spoken through the prophets.</p>
				<p class="quotes">We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.</p>
				<p class="quotes">We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
				<p class="quotes">We look for the resurrection of the dead,</p>
				<p class="quotes">and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">In other services, we might say the Apostles’ Creed, the equivalent part of which says</p>
				<p class="quotes">I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
				<p class="quotes">the holy catholic Church,</p>
				<p class="quotes">the communion of saints,</p>
				<p class="quotes">the forgiveness of sins,</p>
				<p class="quotes">the resurrection of the body,</p>
				<p class="quotes">and the life everlasting. Amen.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-284" id="footnote-169-284-backlink">284</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">In both creeds, the clause concerning the Holy Spirit introduces a series of apparently disconnected affirmations, which can nevertheless be argued to concern the way in which the speakers of the creed are caught up into the life of the God whose identity they have been declaring: through baptism, through forgiveness, through resurrection – and through participation in the ‘holy catholic Church’ or ‘one holy catholic and apostolic Church’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The four epithets given in the Nicene Creed – one, holy, catholic, apostolic – have long been called the four ‘Marks of the Church’, and they have become a common way for theologians to organize many of the things they want to say about the Church.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-285" id="footnote-169-285-backlink">285</a></span> I am going to be no exception: the bulk of both this chapter and the next will be arranged under those four headings (though not in that order). For reasons that won’t necessarily be clear until we get there, I am going to look at the Church’s worship under the heading ‘One’; at diversity and ecumenism under the heading ‘Catholic’; at the church as witness and as tradition under the heading ‘Apostolic’; and at the Church as sinful and reformed under the heading ‘Holy’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-286" id="footnote-169-286-backlink">286</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-5"><span class="bold">Unity and worship</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">For Christian theology, the Church is one because God is one.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-287" id="footnote-169-287-backlink">287</a></span> The Church comes into existence as the one Spirit draws people into the body of the one Son, on the way to the one Father – and Father, Son and Spirit are one. However diverse may be the ways in which the light of Christ’s relationship to the Father is refracted by the Spirit in different people, different places and different times, all those refractions are in principle united because they are refractions of light from a common source.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-288" id="footnote-169-288-backlink">288</a></span> They point back towards that one source, and reflect that source to one another and to the world – or so Christian theology claims.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I will have much more to say about the form that this unity of the Church takes or fails to take when I discuss the Church’s ‘catholicity’ later on. For now, my focus is simply on the claim that the unity of the Church is not found in the Church itself, but in the source to which it all points, and toward which it is all moving. It is like a painting of a landscape, drawn in such a way that the vanishing point, the point where the lines of perspective appear to converge, is outside the frame of the picture.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You may, however, notice a problem with the claim that this unity is a mark of the Church. God, I have repeatedly claimed, is the source and goal of the whole world. <span class="italic">Everything</span> has its unity in God, for Christian theology – and yet a ‘mark’ of the Church should be something that helps us distinguish the Church from other realities. It is more accurate, therefore, to say that the unity of the Church, its oneness, is not so much to be found in the claim that it has its source and goal in God, but in the claim that it acknowledges, witnesses to, proclaims and celebrates this source and goal. The unity of the Church is therefore to be found in the Church’s <span class="italic">worship</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Worship is a matter of putting God and the world in their rightful places – of acknowledging that God is the source and goal of all things, and of acknowledging that the world has its source and goal in God. More fully, worship is a matter of <span class="italic">praise</span> as God is acknowledged as the unencompassable source of all goodness, truth and beauty; it is a matter of <span class="italic">thanks</span> as the goodness, truth and beauty that people find in their lives and their world, and those lives and that world themselves, are acknowledged as gifts from God.</p>

To say ‘I believe in God’ and yet not to worship is to speak nonsense: God is known only in thanks and praise. Similarly, to acknowledge in thanks and praise that one’s life and one’s world comes to one as a gift from a source, however little one can see or say of that source, <span class="italic">is</span> belief in and knowledge of God.

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">It might, therefore, be more direct to say that <span class="italic">worship</span> is a mark of the Church. Many different activities and programmes and tendencies and events and habits are associated with the Church, but it is worship that is its central distinctive activity. Without worship – without people’s coming before God in explicit acknowledgement and celebration of who God is and how they stand with respect to God – there is no Church. Worship is what makes all other activities and practices become activities and practices of the Church. Meeting together, for instance, is transformed by worship from being an activity paralleled in any social club anywhere, to being something done before God, for God’s sake. Activities of mission in the world are, similarly, transformed from simply being forms of voluntary social action or propaganda, and become aspects of the mission of God, calling all people deeper into the life of God. Worship makes the Church.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-289" id="footnote-169-289-backlink">289</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-7"><span class="bold">Called out in worship</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">Worship is, in one sense of the word, marked by <span class="italic">ecstasy</span> – that is, by <span class="italic">ek-stasis</span>: by being called out of oneself, focused outside oneself, turned to face away from oneself. Worship involves people acknowledging, <span class="italic">knowing</span>, that they are not their own source; that the goodness, truth and beauty that they meet is not their creation or possession, that everything they have, everything they <span class="italic">are</span>, they have received from a loving source. It has to do with acknowledging a source of value and strength and life and support outside oneself, which one does not control; it has to do with finding oneself overwhelmed, bowled over and carried away by something beyond one.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Worship understood in this way is poised between two tempting distortions. Worship can become an expression of anxiety: an activity in which the worshippers seek to persuade themselves and others that God is on their side, or an activity in which worshippers try to win God over, placate or bribe God. Worship can become an activity focused on protecting and advancing the anxious self. Ek-static worship, however, is not a way of getting something done; it is not an achievement. Worship, one might say, is fundamentally not useful, not utilitarian; it is not a <span class="italic">technique</span>. And therefore to engage in worship – or, better, to be caught up in worship – is, in this understanding, one way in which self-centredness is broken open; one way in which illusions of control and security are torn down. We might say that worship is a matter of being <span class="italic">called out</span> of those things.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Liturgy as play</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘The practice of the liturgy means that by the help of grace, under the guidance of the Church, we grow into living works of art before God, with no other aim or purpose than that of living and existing in his sight; it means fulfilling God’s Word and “becoming as little children”; it means foregoing maturity with all its purposefulness, and confining oneself to play, as David did when he danced before the Ark. It may, of course, happen that those extremely clever people, who merely from being grown-up have lost all spiritual youth and spontaneity, will misunderstand this and jibe at it. David probably had to face the derision of Michal.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘It is in this very aspect of the liturgy that its didactic aim is to be found, that of teaching the soul not to see purposes everywhere, not to be too conscious of the end it wishes to attain, not to be desirous of being over-clever and grown-up, but to understand simplicity in life. The soul must learn to abandon, at least in prayer, the restlessness of purposeful activity; it must learn to waste time for the sake of God, and to be prepared for the sacred game with sayings and thoughts and gestures, without always immediately asking “why?” and “wherefore?” It must learn not to be continually yearning to do something, to attack something, to accomplish something useful, but to play the divinely ordained game of the liturgy in liberty and beauty and holy joy before God.’</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In the other direction, however, worship can become an activity in which the worshipping self simply tries to disappear. That is, it can become an activity in which worshippers abandon any sense of God as a source of life and love, and of their own lives and world as God’s gift. Worship can be an activity or experience in which worshippers are not simply taken beyond their self-centredness, but are led to despise themselves, to consider themselves as worms, and to hate the world by contrast with the glories of the heaven to which they direct their gaze. Yet worship, if it is worship of the God that I have been discussing in this book, should be an activity in which the worshipper learns to value himself or herself properly – to recognize himself or herself as a gift of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So worship is, in this view, a matter of response to grace, of hearing and answering a call. Different forms and styles of worship can be seen as tied to different assumptions about how that call is mediated to the worshipper. For some, the call is heard primarily in the spoken word – in the words of Scripture, and of preaching that expounds Scripture; much of worship might be orchestrated listening giving way to penitent and thankful response. For others, the call might be mediated particularly by music, with its capacity to worm its way into our bodies and minds and set us resonating to its own rhythm: the dynamic of such worship might be less obviously that of call and response, and more a matter of being drawn into participation with a movement that takes one out of oneself. For still others, the call might be heard most clearly in silence – as the worshipping self learns to attend to all the voices running through it, and to discern where among all the self’s selfish or despairing, distracted or obsessed babbling the call of God is echoing.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In some moments in Christian history, the paradigm of the worshipper has been the individual alone on a mountainside somewhere, glorying in a golden sunset, dozens of miles from the nearest distracting voice or face. The worshipper encounters a context that vastly exceeds the self, but of which the self is a constituent part, and there can be a strong sense not simply of acknowledging creation’s beauty, grandeur or breathtaking intricacy, but of being caught up in the song of praise that creation <span class="italic">is</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-291" id="footnote-169-291-backlink">291</a></span> Yet it is more consonant with the theology I have been exploring to suggest that the call of God is mediated more fully not by sunsets and mountains, but by other people. Worship is inseparable from the process in which a person’s limited, cramped and narrow vision of God is broken open and expanded by encounter with other people who think and see differently, who <span class="italic">are</span> different – being surprised by them, surprised by what they convey of God, and surprised by what God speaks through them. If worship involves delighting in the call of God, then the doctrine of the Spirit suggests that other people are the widest doorways into real worship, doorways into what has been called the ‘constantly astonished joy’ that is the keynote of praise.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-292" id="footnote-169-292-backlink">292</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Wherever the emphasis falls, however, the basic pattern is the same: worship is fundamentally response to the call of God as it is mediated to the worshipper through some creaturely reality.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-8"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Worship is response to the call of God.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">That call is always mediated by some creaturely reality: words, music, nature, other people, etc.</li>

					<li class="bullet-list">Worship is not a debasement of the self.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-9"><span class="bold">Sacraments</span></p>
				<p class="text">We need at this point to talk about some particular forms of worship that have been central to most forms of the Christian tradition: sacraments. In most Protestant circles, baptism and the Eucharist are considered the only or chief sacraments; in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy there are considered to be seven: Eucharist, baptism, confirmation, marriage, ordination, extreme unction (anointing with oil at the time of death) and penance (confession). I will be concentrating on baptism and the Eucharist in what follows.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Theologians have come up with many ways of defining ‘sacrament’ – including the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Sacraments are ‘visible words’ or ‘visible signs of an invisible grace’ (St Augustine).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-293" id="footnote-169-293-backlink">293</a></span></li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Sacraments are ‘certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace and God’s good will towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm, our faith in him’ (Anglican Book of Common Prayer).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-294" id="footnote-169-294-backlink">294</a></span></li>
					<li class="bullet-list">‘A sacrament is an holy ordinance instituted by Christ, wherein, by sensible signs, Christ, and the benefits of the new covenant, are represented, sealed, and applied to believers’ (Westminster Shorter Catechism).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-295" id="footnote-169-295-backlink">295</a></span></li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Sacraments are ‘outward signs, words, or actions, ordained of God, and appointed for this end, to be the ordinary channels whereby he might convey to men, preventing, justifying, or sanctifying grace’ (John Wesley).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-296" id="footnote-169-296-backlink">296</a></span></li>
					<li class="bullet-list">‘The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify men, to build up the body of Christ, and, finally, to give worship to God; because they are signs they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, but by words and objects they also nourish, strengthen, and express it; that is why they are called “sacraments of faith”. They do indeed impart grace, but, in addition, the very act of celebrating them most effectively disposes the faithful to receive this grace in a fruitful manner, to worship God duly, and to practice charity’ (Vatican II).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-297" id="footnote-169-297-backlink">297</a></span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">We can try to put some of these definitions together into something like a common explanation. In the first place, sacraments are certain activities of the Church: fairly formal, liturgical, ceremonial actions that are repeated time and time again. Those actions are not thought of simply as inventions of the Church, however: they are (in the first place) seen as responses to God’s promises in Christ. In fact, traditionally, they were seen as activities that were specifically and deliberately instituted by Christ among the apostles.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-298" id="footnote-169-298-backlink">298</a></span> Nevertheless, the idea that the initiative lies with God, and that the Church’s activity is a matter of response and participation in something done for them and with them, is still important in most definitions. So, sacraments are regular activities of the Church understood as <span class="italic">responses</span> to God. They are also seen as activities that represent, dramatically picture or portray some aspect of God’s activity towards the world – they ‘act it out’ as it were. Lastly (and most controversially, though also most importantly) sacraments have been seen not only as activities of the Church that respond to God’s promises and that represent God’s action, but as activities that provide the vehicle or the context or the occasion or the opportunity for God’s action to work upon the recipients afresh. So as well as responding to God’s action, and as well as representing God’s action, sacraments have been seen as activities in which the recipients are acted upon by God’s grace.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The controversies that surround this last idea are legion. There is, for instance, a spectrum from those who focus most upon the sacraments as a means by which God acts upon the believer, to those who focus upon the sacraments most as a context in which the believer responds to God – ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ understandings of the sacraments, as they are sometimes known. At the objective end of the spectrum are those who believe that in the sacramental activity something <span class="italic">happens</span> to the believer; he or she is given something or changed in some way – and the sacrament is said to be effective in and of itself (or <span class="italic">ex opere operato</span>, as the Latin tag goes).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-299" id="footnote-169-299-backlink">299</a></span> At the subjective end of the spectrum are those who believe that the sacraments mediate God’s grace only to the extent that they are received in faith – they are vehicles for the awakening and feeding of faith, and it is only when that faithful reception and response is present that the sacraments can be said to be doing anything.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-300" id="footnote-169-300-backlink">300</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">I am going to take a fairly middle-of-the-road route through the debate about the nature of sacraments at this point. That does not mean that it is right (I cannot solve a long-standing and very complex debate as simply as that), but it might mean that readers who lean towards differing ends of the spectrum of possible answers will be able to see something of worth in the route that I take. I am going to ask two questions of each of the sacraments that we look at: How is the Church describing itself here?<span class="italic"> </span>and What is the Church becoming here?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The first question assumes that sacraments are activities of the Church that <span class="italic">say something</span> about what the Church is.

				<p class="text">‘The eucharist is essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit. Every Christian receives this gift of salvation through communion in the body and blood of Christ. In the eucharistic meal, in the eating and drinking of the bread and wine, Christ grants communion with himself. God himself acts, giving life to the body of Christ and renewing each member. In accordance with Christ’s promise, each baptized member of the body of Christ receives in the eucharist the assurance of the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26.28) and the pledge of eternal life (John 6.51–58).’</p>
				<p class="source">World Council of Churches, <span class="italic">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry </span>(1982)<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-301" id="footnote-169-301-backlink">301</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above">When people talk about sacraments they are very often talking about the Eucharist, or Holy Communion, or Lord’s Supper: that activity in which the members of the Church eat bread and drink wine, connecting those in some way with the last supper that Jesus shared with his disciples, and specifically with his declaration over their bread and wine that ‘This is my body’ and ‘This is my blood’ (Mark 14.22–25; Matthew 26.26–29; Luke 22.19–20; 1 Corinthians 11.24–25).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">During his ministry, and climactically at the last supper, Jesus used food and drink as a vehicle for creating unexpected fellowship. He ate and drank with others – with sinners, with tax-collectors, even with Pharisees – without setting preconditions.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-302" id="footnote-169-302-backlink">302</a></span> He shared himself with them, welcoming them to share his life. When, at the last supper, Jesus broke and shared bread, and distributed wine, it was the climax of this strand of his ministry. He was once again establishing fellowship with his disciples without setting conditions upon that fellowship, sharing with both the faithful and the faithless; handing himself over to his disciples, rather than holding aloof and protecting himself from them. In the drama of that night he was later to hand himself over more directly, by refusing to defend himself from his faithless disciples, but at the supper he already symbolically put passive bread and wine into their hands and declared that in handling it, the disciples were handling him, that they had power to do as they would with the life that he had gratuitously shared with them. He makes the disciples at table with him (including the ones who are about to betray him) his guests.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Within hours, he has died a bloody death on the cross, and his symbolic handing of his body and blood to the disciples at the supper has taken on a deeper and more terrifying resonance. He did not simply place in their hands a gift of his ‘life’ in some safe metaphorical sense: it was his physical life – his real body and blood. He was given into their hands for them to do with as they wished, and they betrayed and abandoned him, letting that body be broken and that blood be spilt. The bread and wine of the supper retrospectively become vehicles, not just of the life of fellowship that he has been sharing with others, but of his total, costly self-gift made upon the cross. And the last supper, as it were, reads the cross <span class="italic">as</span> a gift – not as the unwilling tearing of Jesus’ life from him, but as a gift freely made.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">When Christians celebrate the Eucharist, after the cross and after the resurrection, they relinquish the bread and wine as their possessions, matter under their control, and receive them back from Jesus’ hands. As Christians receive bread and wine from his hands, they are welcomed to his table; they accept the gift of fellowship, the sharing of his life. The gift that he made to his disciples of his body and blood is a gift made for them also – and it is a gift that sets no preconditions. It is given to faithful and faithless alike, and is given again and again despite the deepest failures and betrayals.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">So, on the one hand, in the Eucharist we find the Church <span class="italic">describing </span>itself. It describes itself as the extension of that group of disciples who sat and ate with Jesus, who were given the bread and the wine by him, who betrayed and abandoned him, and who he met and forgave after his resurrection. It describes itself as having been given the body and blood of Christ, the gift Christ made of himself as he shared his life with sinners and made a new life possible for them. It describes itself as a body that goes on being given this life, and needs it in order to live: this life is its food, its medicine. It describes itself being given that life in part by joining in table-fellowship with Jesus: eating and drinking with him. It describes the bread and wine as bread and wine that Jesus has given back to them as he shares his life with them, and so as vehicles of that sharing. It describes itself as a group for whom Christ has died – who have had, as it were, Christ’s life handed over to them, and now have it growing within them, and in whose hands it is to betray or glorify it in the world. It says, when it carries out this strange ritual eating and drinking: This is who we are; this is what we are growing into; we are becoming the body of Christ, the community of Christ.</p>

								<p class="text">A ritual is more like a poem than like prose. It cannot be paraphrased, but lends itself to being ‘read’ in multiple ways. It matters that the Eucharist is not first and foremost a message or form of words handed on in the Church, but a ritual practice (or family of ritual practices). And the words of Christ (‘This is my body’, ‘this is my blood’) that Christians remember when they celebrate the Eucharist are not (as Christian history has proved) a commentary that <span class="italic">explains</span> the ritual: they are part of the ritual’s strange script.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The celebration of the Eucharist is not the Church’s declaration that it is a perfect community; rather, the Church acknowledges in the Eucharist that it is a community held together despite its failures and betrayals by the capacious, gracious giving of Christ. It is a community given the terrifying privilege of handling this gift, and passing it on, made by this gift into givers. So the Eucharist is an activity of the Church in which the Church tells itself about the nature of its own life. It represents its life to itself: representing its life as a gift, representing itself as frail and fallible recipient of that gift, and representing itself as charged to carry that gift in the world – bearing the question of Christ wherever it might go.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, we also find in the Eucharist that the Church is <span class="italic">becoming</span> itself. The Eucharist is not simply an activity in which the shaping and growth of the community is described, it is an activity in which the community actually grows and is shaped. So, it is an activity in which (during the preparation), however distractedly and dimly, those gathered hear the words of Christ, confess their sins and repent. It is an activity in which the community comes together and eats together – having to face up, however fleetingly and feebly, to the reality of sharing the same table or communion rail or building. In this activity, we could say, Christians come into a context in which they can be challenged, judged, remade. And they do not understand this as primarily their own achievement, but as God shaping them – this sacramental activity of theirs being a space in which they become aware of and open to the divine activity that enfolds them and is drawing them more deeply into God’s life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is, of course, still a rather idealized description of what happens in actual eucharistic services. What about those times when it is simply routine? What about those times when the recipients don’t pay attention? What about those times when they ignore the people around them? What about the times when they are more focused on not letting the toddler by their side trip and bash his head on the hard communion rail? Is anything happening then? It seems to me that even then there <span class="italic">is</span> something objective about it: even if nothing appears to change, this activity sets the terms by which the recipients are to be judged. It is rather like saying ‘I promise’ in front of witnesses. (And it is, perhaps, worth noting that in saying this I am following the Swiss Reformer Huldrych Zwingli, who is often taken to mark the most ‘subjective’ end of sacramental theology.)<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-303" id="footnote-169-303-backlink">303</a></span> If you say ‘I promise’ in front of witnesses, you cannot then wriggle out of the obligation that promising involves by saying ‘I wasn’t really concentrating; I wasn’t being serious; I don’t feel like I promised; it wasn’t a product of deep conviction’. If you say ‘I promise’ then you have indeed promised. Imagine being in an army where the general were looking for volunteers for a particular mission, and standing to say ‘I’ll go’. The standing and speaking would commit you, even if you were not taking it seriously, even if your subsequent behaviour denied it, or showed that you had not realized what you were letting yourself in for. You would be, thanks to that action, a volunteer. In the Eucharist, even if recipients fail to take it seriously, even if they fail to let themselves be practically reshaped, they accept again (verbally and in their actions) that Christ’s life has been given to them. They take it in their hands.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-304" id="footnote-169-304-backlink">304</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Whatever they then do with it, however they react, I think it makes sense to say that the handing over of Christ’s life is something that happens to them in the Eucharist. And I think it makes sense to say that it is Christ who hands his life over to the Church in this way – and so to say that while at one level of description this sacramental worship is clearly the activity of the Church, something that believers do, at another level of description it is something that <span class="italic">Christ</span> is doing. And whilst at one level of description it is clearly ordinary bread and wine that is handled in this sacramental worship, at another level of description it is the life of Jesus of Nazareth. It is the body and blood of Christ. William Temple put it this way:</p>
				<p class="quotes">‘My body’ is that part of the physical world which moves directly in response to my will, and thus the vehicle or the medium whereby I effect my purposes. … In precisely this sense (I suggest) the Eucharistic Bread is the body of Christ. … As through the physical organism which was His Body He revealed in agony and death the utter obedience of Humanity in His Person to the Father, which is the atoning sacrifice, so through the broken Bread He shows it still and enables us to become participants therein.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-305" id="footnote-169-305-backlink">305</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">This is to say more than that the bread and wine take on a particular significance for believers; that is, it is to speak about something more than the way that believers happen to place a particular interpretation on the bread and the wine: I think it proper (as perhaps some at the most subjective end of the spectrum do not) to speak of the activity of Christ making himself present, handing himself over, as well as of the activity of the celebrating believers. But equally, this is to say something quite different from any claim (as may be made in some popular piety at the most objective end of the spectrum) that some disguised change – a hidden chemical change, as it were – has taken place in the bread and wine. (This is not, by the way, to reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of ‘transubstantiation’: Herbert McCabe, while defending precisely that doctrine, explains that it too involves the rejection of the idea that ‘in the Eucharist the body of Christ is <span class="italic">disguised</span> as food and drink, perhaps to make it easier to eat and drink, as a ferro-concrete house can be disguised as half-timbered Tudor’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-306" id="footnote-169-306-backlink">306</a></span>) In the Eucharist – whatever the appropriate metaphysical distinctions might be by which this could be said with proper clarity and precision – the life of Christ is handed over to the Church, just as he handed it to the first disciples on the night before he died.</p>

				<p class="text">‘Baptism is the sign of new life through Jesus Christ. It unites the one baptized with Christ and with his people. The New Testament scriptures and the liturgy of the Church unfold the meaning of baptism in various images which express the riches of Christ and the gifts of his salvation. These images are sometimes linked with the symbolic uses of water in the Old Testament. Baptism is participation in Christ’s death and resurrection (Rom. 6.3–5; Col. 2.12); a washing away of sin (1 Cor. 6.11); a new birth (John 3.5); an enlightenment by Christ (Eph. 5.14); a re-clothing in Christ (Gal. 3.27); a renewal by the Spirit (Titus 3.5); the experience of salvation from the flood (1 Peter 3.20–21); an exodus from bondage (1 Cor. 10.1–2) and a liberation into a new humanity in which barriers of division whether of sex or race or social status are transcended (Gal. 3.27–28; 1 Cor. 12.13). The images are many but the reality is one.’</p>
				<p class="source">World Council of Churches, <span class="italic">Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry </span>(1982)<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-307" id="footnote-169-307-backlink">307</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">If the Eucharist is a sacrament in which the sustaining, growth and flourishing of life in God is celebrated regularly throughout a Christian’s life, baptism is a sacrament in which <span class="italic">initiation</span> into that life is celebrated, once for each person. Instead of the eating and drinking of bread and wine, baptism involves immersion in, or sprinkling with water. But just as the interpretation of the Eucharist has been a major source of controversy in Christian history, so baptism is hotly debated, with debate focusing in particular on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of <span class="italic">infant</span> baptism, as opposed to the baptism of adult believers.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The American theologian Daniel Migliore gives a useful summary of some of the main lines of New Testament interpretation of the act of baptism.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-308" id="footnote-169-308-backlink">308</a></span> He notes that it is presented as dying and rising with Christ, that it is pictured as the washing of a sin-stained life, that it is portrayed as rebirth or new birth, that it is linked to incorporation into Christ (into unity with Christ); and that it is seen as a sign of God’s coming reign.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Baptism is seen as portraying or enacting the beginning of the life of faith – the life in which the Spirit draws people alongside Christ, or in unity with Christ, towards the Father. In baptism, people enter upon the path that Christ took – symbolically going down with him into the grave and rising with him to resurrection life, and they do so not because it is something that they have constructed and achieved, but because this is a life into which the Spirit has drawn them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The baptized person is being redescribed in baptism. Baptism says of the candidate, this person that you see entering the water and emerging from it has died and risen. From now on, all that you see in them that resists the grace of God, that refuses to unlearn idolatry or to learn the truth of God, you must consider as dead, necrotic tissue in this person’s life: material that is as good as dead, that is rotting away – material that has nothing to do with this person’s true identity. And from now on, whenever you see this person demonstrating God’s love, witnessing to God’s life, you must consider that as their true, risen identity: that is who this person most truly is, even if that identity is still hidden by much that is dying. And when you see that healthy identity shining through, you are not to think of it as the achievement or success of this individual, but as the work of the Spirit conforming this person to Christ, clothing him or her (to switch metaphors) with Christ’s righteousness. This individual has died, and has risen – and all that you see after this is simply the working out of that basic fact.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And so in baptizing new members, the Church describes itself as simultaneously sinful and holy: as filled with people who have died and risen, but in whom the dying flesh still vies with healthy tissue. The Church points to Christ – whose path through crucifixion and resurrection is represented in baptism – as the touchstone of its own life: pointing to him and saying that its own life is only worth something, only interesting, only powerful, to the extent that it reflects his life; that its life is sinful and distorted and failing to the extent that it makes Christ harder to see.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What actually happens in baptism, however? What is the Church or the believer becoming here? What does baptism <span class="italic">change</span>? I could give an account like the one I gave of the Eucharist above, that sees the sacrament as involving something like promising or volunteering, something that objectively changes the situation of the one baptized, without necessarily requiring of them explicitly felt and understood commitment. However, to go down that route would only be to encounter one of the big debates about baptism that has divided Christians for centuries: does it make sense to baptize infants? Those who defend the baptism of infants tend to lean quite strongly towards the ‘objective’ end of the sacramental spectrum. They see baptism as a celebration and enactment of what the baptized person <span class="italic">receives</span> from God – the recognition that God’s promises apply to this person too, or – more strongly – a rite in which those promises are in fact made afresh for this person. The focus falls on what God has done (promised) and what God will do (fulfil those promises).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Those who attack infant baptism tend to lean more towards the ‘subjective’ end of the spectrum – to place the focus on baptism as a <span class="italic">response </span>to God’s promises, an act of reception and obedience on the part of the person baptized. Baptism becomes an act of explicit public commitment on the part of the one baptized.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Opposing views</span></p>
				<p class="text">Baptism ‘bears first and final testimony to the work of God on which any response of our own must be grounded … baptism does not arise <span class="italic">out of</span> any work of ours. It is baptism <span class="italic">into</span> the work of God on our behalf … even our own response is the work of God. … [R]egeneration is not a human possibility. …</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘[I]t does not stand alone but is part of that total renewing in Christ’s image which embraces sanctification and glorification as well. … Even the adult has neither reached that which baptism signifies nor begun to grasp what its consummation will be. By coming to personal repentance and faith he might be a little further on the road of entry into the divine work. But the Spirit who has brought him thus far is the Spirit who works in infants too – and both he and they have a long way to go before they are brought by the Spirit into the fullness of the baptismal work.’</p>

				<p class="text">‘The New Testament undoubtedly does provide for the singling out of children who are born and brought up in the community of Jesus Christ which is gathered, built up and sent out by the Holy Spirit. Since they live from the very first with parents who are summoned to this people … their situation is certainly very different from that of children who do not have this privilege. The fact that the promise which is given to this people and the claim to which it is subjected are from the very first (to varying degrees) presented to them and brought to their attention, means that they enjoy a very special <span class="italic">praevenire</span> of the grace of God. Even for these children, however, it cannot be cheap grace. … The Christian life cannot be inherited as blood, gifts, characteristics and inclinations are inherited. No Christian environment, however genuine or sincere, can transfer this life to those who are in this environment. For these, too, the Christian life will and can begin only on the basis of their own liberation by God, their own decision. Its beginning … cannot be made for them by others through the fact that, without being asked about their own decision, they received baptism.’</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">So is baptism primarily the free, deliberate response of the believing person? Or is baptism primarily an acknowledgement of or even vehicle for what God has done and is doing for the person being baptized? That seems to be the core of the debate between those who favour infant baptism and those who don’t – and as there can be no hope that I will manage here to resolve a question that has divided thoughtful Christians for many generations, I simply want to offer some personal reflections on the answer that has made sense to me and to my wife, as we have had both our children baptized. These reflections that follow are not meant to <span class="italic">settle</span> anything: they are not meant to <span class="italic">prove</span> anything one way or another, simply to explain one point of view.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Why did we have Bridget and Tom baptized when each was only three months old? Baptism has – as I have explained – always been understood as a kind of dying and rising: going down into the water to die to one kind of life, and coming up out of the water to rise to another kind of life. In baptizing Bridget and Tom, part of what we were doing was recognizing that they were already caught up in this dying and rising. This may sound like an odd kind of claim to make about tiny babies, but I mean it quite seriously. They had already taken the first small steps along the path towards recognizing that they were persons among other persons, steps towards recognizing that other people have their own continuity and character, steps towards recognizing that other people have their own needs and desires; steps towards the discovery that they were not the centre of the universe (despite what their parents might have thought); steps towards the discovery that they are called out of themselves to be responsive to others. You can think of this process of calling out as, even at this early stage, a process of ‘dying to self’ – dying to the kind of life entirely centred on and absorbed in one’s own needs and desires. You can also think of it as a process of ‘rising to life’ – of waking up to a life beyond the self, to a life of communion. It is a path that starts with such things as beginning to recognize a mother’s face, and playing games in a mirror; it is a path that leads towards love and justice.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, one part of what we thought we were doing in these baptisms was <span class="italic">recognizing </span>that Bridget and Tom were dying and rising. And we proclaimed that we believe that it is the Spirit who leads them on this path – that the tiny psychological and social and behavioural developments that they were undergoing have to be understood by Christians as the work of the Spirit, because that is who the Spirit is: the one who leads the world into love and justice.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But we have done more than that, because baptism is baptism into the dying and rising of <span class="italic">Jesus of Nazareth</span>, specifically – and in baptizing Bridget and Tom, we have accepted that the path on which they are already set is Jesus’ path. It is therefore a path that goes higher, deeper and into stranger territory than one might expect. We have proclaimed our conviction that the path on which they are already set is, if its full length is seen, a path that runs towards a love like Jesus’ love, which is God’s love. The call that Bridget and Tom already hear in other people, which begins to draw them out of themselves, we recognize as the first whispers of the voice of God; the love that Bridget and Tom feel, that enables them to grow towards becoming loving themselves, we recognize as the first felt warmth of God’s love towards them. In having them baptized, we have publicly named the path Bridget and Tom are on as the way of Jesus Christ, the way of the cross, the way of God’s love and justice – accepting, on their behalf, that the life, death and resurrection of Christ are the criterion by which what is truly lasting and important in their lives should be judged. And so they, even in the tiny steps which they have already taken towards learning to love, have already been placed in a context in which the moral and spiritual developments that shape their lives even now become witnesses to Christ. They have become those who reflect in their own particular, unreproducible way the life of the one under whose sign they now grow.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And lastly, we have made promises: promises to bring Bridget and Tom up in such a way that they learn the name of the path they are on, the name of the one who is calling them, the name of the one who is loving them into love. We have promised to help them learn that they are called to die and rise with Christ, to grow in love for neighbour and for God. Those promises will, if we even begin to be faithful to them, inevitably shape the particular way in which Bridget and Tom grow and develop. They will bed down in them and become part of who they are.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is, of course, no way away from such shaping. A large part of what we are is always received from those who bring us up. We could not have chosen to bring Bridget and Tom up in neutrality, entirely free to make their own marks on a blank slate: there is no neutrality; there is no blank state. We hope to bring them up in such a way that they will be able to think and question and choose – but we don’t think we will do that by trying to bring them up standing in no particular place. Rather, we choose to bring them up in a way which we think leads to greater freedom.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, when we had Bridget and Tom baptized, we recognized that they were already dying and rising. We set up a public marker, saying that this dying and rising was dying and rising with Christ, and should be understood in that light. And we made promises – promises that will become part of who Bridget and Tom are – to help turn their faces towards that criterion, so that the path they are on leads more firmly in the direction of this kind of love and justice.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-311" id="footnote-169-311-backlink">311</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-15"><span class="bold">The Church catholic</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Of course, everything that I have just said is controversial. This is one of those topics that splinters churches, dividing the one body of Christ into disagreeing and disagreeable factions, each convinced that its way is true. It is, in other words, one of the tears in the Church’s <span class="italic">catholicity</span>. The word ‘catholic’ in this context means something like ‘universal’ (it comes from Greek <span class="italic">kath’ holou </span>– ‘as a whole, in general’). If the Church is one, it also must be catholic: each part of it should live by relation to all the other parts of it, learning from (and teaching) every other part, so as to help all the parts together see more of the one source and goal of the Church’s life. This is something I have already spoken about: the call for each member of the body to become a gift to the whole body, and to receive the other members as gifts. The Church as catholic is meant to be an ‘economy of gift’: a society defined and held together by this mutual giving of Christ. According to the credal definition, the Church simply is the community of those who give and receive Christ to and from one another.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Distinguishing marks</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">It is ironic to describe catholicity as a ‘mark of the Church’. If you look for popular discussions of the marks, you will often find that they are used as <span class="italic">boundary markers</span>. Various writers will tell you that they are marks that enable you to locate the <span class="italic">real</span> Church, and belong to it. For instance, if you look on-line, and do a search for ‘marks of the Church’, you will find quite a few that come from sites dedicated to Roman Catholic apologetics. The following is a fairly typical example:</p>
				<p class="quotes">These four marks of the Church – one, holy, catholic, and apostolic – are fully realized in the Catholic Church. While other Christian Churches accept and profess the Creed, and possess elements of truth and sanctification, only the Roman Catholic Church reflects the fullness of these marks.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-312" id="footnote-169-312-backlink">312</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">You can also find Protestant or Orthodox examples. For example,</p>
				<p class="display-quote">The Church is one because God is one, and because Christ and the Holy Spirit are one. There can only be one Church and not many. … Orthodox Christians believe that in the historical Orthodox Church there exists the full possibility of participating totally in the Church of God, and that only sins and false human choices (heresies) put men outside of this unity. In non-Orthodox Christian groups the Orthodox claim that there are certain formal obstacles, varying in different groups, which, if accepted and followed by men, will prevent their perfect unity with God and will thus destroy the genuine unity of the Church.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-313" id="footnote-169-313-backlink">313</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Or, from a (rather older) Protestant source:</p>
				<p class="text">it is evident that truth of doctrine or conformity with the word of God is the true and genuine mark of the true church. … [I]t is not difficult to gather … what is that true church to which we are bound to join ourselves in order to obtain salvation. Whether it is the modern Roman church, which retains so many capital errors and idolatries altogether opposed to the word of God in faith and worship; or, on the other hand, ours, which is content with the word of God alone.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-314" id="footnote-169-314-backlink">314</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above">All too obviously, the Church is divided. There are Coptic, Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Pentecostal churches; charismatics, evangelicals, liberals; Trinitarians and Unitarians, Episcopalians and Presbyterians: all sorts of divisions emerging from a tangled and complex history.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-315" id="footnote-169-315-backlink">315</a></span> And the history of those divisions is a history bound up with culture, politics and power – with the interventions of Roman emperors trying by authoritarian means to keep the Empire unified and running; with the divisions between Greek culture and Latin culture; with the political and economic changes surrounding the emergence of the modern nation state in Western Europe; with the marital history of English kings, and so on. Sometimes the splits look tragically unnecessary; sometimes they seem to rest on deep, irreconcilable differences in theology and practice. Sometimes one group or side seems to be pretty largely in the wrong; more often it is hard to find heroes and villains, and all sides seem to have equal claim to have grasped something important, something that they were right to seek to protect or preserve.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What does it mean to affirm the catholicity of the Church in this context? The Church is <span class="italic">one</span> because Christians are on one journey, caught up together by one Spirit into conformity to one Christ on the way to one Father. The Church is <span class="italic">catholic</span> because Christians are, fundamentally, on that one journey together – and it is supposed to be a journey in which they travel not only towards God but closer to one another, until they are close enough to become gifts to, and recipients of, one another. Without some form of communion with one another – a situation in which Christians can learn with and from each other – everyone’s faith is impoverished. Fractures in the church are fractures in the body of Christ, and they correspond directly to breaks in Christians’ knowledge of Christ: gaps where Christians have not learnt as they might from others, because their communion with those others is impaired.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Ecumenism in some form – the attempt to work towards reunion or communion between the divided branches of Christianity – is therefore a natural response to division, for anyone who shares a theology similar to the one I have described. By the same token, however, a search for <span class="italic">uniformity</span> is not called for – indeed, is positively ruled out. One does not learn from those one has turned into clones of oneself.</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Church is divided.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Yet the Church simply is the community of those who give and receive Christ to and from one another.</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-19-17"><span class="bold">Ecumenism</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">Roughly speaking, we can identify two kinds of ecumenism – two kinds of movement towards the overcoming of denominational and other divisions in Christianity. On the one hand, there are official moves, negotiated by Church leaders, sealed in lengthy technical ecumenical documents and constitutional agreements.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-316" id="footnote-169-316-backlink">316</a></span> On the other hand, there are unofficial moves, co-operation and interaction at a ‘grass-roots’ level, between individuals and congregations who find themselves in proximity, despite the gaps that supposedly separate their churches.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-317" id="footnote-169-317-backlink">317</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">It would be tempting to think that the problems always exist at the official level, and that the grass-roots level – the level of ‘ordinary’ believers and congregations – is where real unity is to be found. The reality is more complex. Division can be rooted at either level. It can be rooted in the official teachings of a given denomination, and the expert theologians and church leaders who are tasked with preserving the inheritance of their particular tradition – the truths that they believe this denomination has seen more clearly, or practised more faithfully, than others. But it can also be rooted in the mutual suspicion and antagonism of ordinary believers and congregations – congregations that have learnt, perhaps, to define themselves over against other nearby congregations who do things differently, or who have a different kind of person attending, or who simply ‘aren’t us’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, moves towards co-operation and communion can take place at both levels. At grass roots, you can find that individuals and congregations, sometimes despite the official line of their denominations, discover that they can work together – share services, co-operate in social outreach, use the same buildings, meet together for worship, become friends. At the official level, you can find that theologians and church leaders, sometimes despite the deep-seated mutual antagonism of the actual congregations they represent, can work towards the point where nothing official stands in the way of communion: the point where historic disagreements in theology, historic differences in practice, are put into a new light – a light that shows that those differences can simply be overcome, or a light that shows that they should not be communion-dividing differences, but are acceptable variations, differences of emphasis and interpretation, within a single faith.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-318" id="footnote-169-318-backlink">318</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">It may be a rather bland thing to say, but it seems pretty clear that a deep-seated ecumenism will need both these forms. If one takes seriously the fact that many churches or denominations do have some kind of official teaching or official practice, it seems clear that they cannot move towards fuller communion without considering whether that official teaching and practice gets in the way – and without considering what the consequences are if it <span class="italic">does</span> get in the way. Moves towards greater communion between, say, Anglicans and Baptists would be avoiding a vital question if at least <span class="italic">some</span> consideration was not given to the question of whether the Baptists could recognize those Anglicans who had been baptized as infants as indeed being baptized believers; and Anglicans would in turn need to consider what they thought was going on when someone who had been sprinkled as a baby became a Baptist and decided to undergo believer’s baptism. Simply to avoid these questions, to pretend that they do not matter, would be disingenuous.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, you can have all the official agreements you like, but if believers ‘on the ground’ remain antagonistic it is a sham. Two congregations in the same village, for instance, might belong to denominations that have officially entered into some kind of communion and resolved many of their official differences. Decisions may have been taken at an official level that each church should recognize the ministers and ministries of the other church, so that full co-operation becomes possible. But if the members and ministers of one congregation never darken the door of the other, and if there is no co-operation, no shared worship, no shared ministry, no shared mission, if there is not even a growing of friendships between members of the two congregations, it is hard not to think that the official agreements are, in this context at least, so much hot air.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">What, however, is the goal of this ecumenism? It need not be the actual reunification of different denominations into a single, undifferentiated new denomination. From the point of view of the theology I have been exploring, the point of ecumenism is the promotion of unimpeded mutual learning. Each church needs to learn from every other church, and each Christian from every other Christian. Ecumenism at its richest is about promoting the possibilities of mutual learning and enrichment at every level: the mutual learning by which the structures, policies and teaching of one church are challenged, deepened, and opened up by encounter with those of another; the mutual learning by which a believer is challenged and called out of her current limited understanding by encounter with another believer. Ecumenism is about increasing and diversifying the ways in which Christians learn: growing the pool of people from whom each Christian can hear God’s call, and building connections that enable border-crossing learning to take place.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Called to be one</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘The <span class="italic">catholicity</span> of the Church expresses the fullness, integrity, and totality of its life in Christ through the Holy Spirit in all times and places. This mystery is expressed in each community of baptized believers in which the apostolic faith is confessed and lived, the gospel is proclaimed, and the sacraments are celebrated. Each church is the Church catholic and not simply a part of it. Each church is the Church catholic, but not the whole of it. Each church fulfils its catholicity when it is in communion with the other churches. We affirm that the catholicity of the Church is expressed most visibly in sharing holy communion and in a mutually recognized and reconciled ministry.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘The relationship among churches is dynamically interactive. Each church is called to mutual giving and receiving gifts and to <span class="italic">mutual accountability</span>. Each church must become aware of all that is provisional in its life and have the courage to acknowledge this to other churches. Even today, when eucharistic sharing is not always possible, divided churches express mutual accountability and aspects of catholicity when they pray for one another, share resources, assist one another in times of need, make decisions together, work together for justice, reconciliation, and peace, hold one another accountable to the discipleship inherent in baptism, and maintain dialogue in the face of differences, refusing to say “I have no need of you” (1 Corinthians 12.21). Apart from one another we are impoverished.’</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Of course, some will say that the idea is all very well, but that in practice ecumenism works by dulling the distinctiveness of those involved in it, weakening individuals’ or groups’ commitment to the truths they have perceived. Doesn’t it work by washing everything down to shades of grey, so that we may say nothing firm, nothing clear, take no stand, in case it offends one of our ecumenical partners? Doesn’t ecumenism involve a drastic failure to take our history, our inheritance, our faith <span class="italic">seriously</span>?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Against ecumenism</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">A quick search on the web turns up several examples of people expressing this fear. For instance, one site declares:</p>
				<p class="display-quote">Ecumenism tries to make one church, but yet it does not truly unite. It turns a blind eye to differences in faith, belief, doctrine, and practice, as if these things do not matter. On the contrary, these things are of the utmost importance! These things are the very basis and foundation of our lives; they are the Church. If we cast these things aside, what is left? All that is left is a shallow, hollow shell of what was formerly the fullness of the Church. If we cast these things aside, we are casting aside our own salvation. It simply does not work to bring everything down to the lowest common denominator and say that the only criteria for being a Christian is that we all believe that Jesus is the Son of God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-320" id="footnote-169-320-backlink">320</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">And another site puts it succinctly:</p>
				<p class="quotes">‘The word of the Lord endureth for ever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you’ (1 Peter 1.25) so there is no ‘fear’ of his words disappearing – except from the homes and churches of today’s modern Ecumenical Christian!<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-321" id="footnote-169-321-backlink">321</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">There is no doubt that ecumenism is not easy – and probably should not be easy. What one sees in the faces of Christians from across some divide will never be entirely unobjectionable, entirely ‘nice’, entirely acceptable. It will challenge and question and upset and irritate and shock – sometimes because those other Christians have seen aspects of the truth that one has not seen, and that one is perhaps not prepared to allow, sometimes because what one sees in those other Christians is something distorted and broken. Each Christian, in the theology I have been promoting, has in his or her particular place and time the joy (and responsibility) of being able to see Christ from an angle from which no others can see him; he or she has his or her own contribution to make to the body of Christ, which cannot be made by any other person. On the other hand he or she is inevitably fallible and weak, and his or her vision of Christ distorted, and each Christian and each Christian group dims or pollutes the light of Christ as they pass it on. Ecumenism is not about finding easy uniformity. It is not about finding no surprises in the Christian family. It is not about finding everyone in that family easy to get on with. It is about learning from them more about Christ, and it is about learning to love them. Without such ecumenism – that is, without a visible and active commitment to rediscover the lost catholicity of the Church – there <span class="italic">is</span> no Church.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The debate about the subjectivity or objectivity of the Eucharist has often been a debate about the nature of Christ’s presence or involvement or activity in the Eucharist.
