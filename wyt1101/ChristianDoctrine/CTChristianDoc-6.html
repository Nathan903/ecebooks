				<p class="text">In Chapter 1, I argued that theology was an exploration of the sense that Christian communities and individuals make of themselves. In this chapter, I will set out what I take to be the most encompassing aspect of that sense: Christians have made sense of themselves as those who have been addressed, or laid hold of, by <span class="italic">God</span>. For Christians, true knowledge of oneself and of the world is inextricably bound up with knowledge of God. But what does ‘God’ mean, and what is it to <span class="italic">know</span> God? In this chapter, I will argue that the nature of God is only properly known in the lives of those whom God has laid hold of – those whom God is addressing and drawing lovingly to Godself, and who share in God’s life. And so I will introduce the main lines of a basic Christian narrative that I will be elaborating in chapters to come: Christians can make sense of themselves as those who are being drawn into the loving life of God, to participate in that life in their own way.</p>

				<p class="text">According to Christian theology, people begin making true sense of themselves and of their world only when they see themselves in relation to God. To leave God out of account would be like making sense of a novel without paying any attention to the central character or to the crucial incidents in which that character makes his or her presence felt. Or – perhaps a better analogy – it would be like trying to make sense of the orbits of the planets without reference to the gravitational pull of the sun. Who a person thinks she is, what she thinks is possible, how she thinks she should act, what she things of the shape and texture of her world – all these look different if they are thought through in relation to God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I am not going to start this discussion of God with the question, ‘Does God exist?’, for the simple reason that one cannot ask about the existence of something when one does not yet know what that something is supposed to be.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-39" id="footnote-169-39-backlink">39</a></span> The question of the <span class="italic">meaning </span>of the word ‘God’ has to come before the question of the <span class="italic">existence </span>of any referent of that word – and the meaning of the word may not be as straightforward as one might think. Someone might say, ‘It is obvious, isn’t it. Everyone knows what “God” means, even if they disagree about whether God exists, or about some of the things God happens to have done? God is an omnipotent being—’ but then Paul of Tarsus might interrupt, speaking about God’s weakness, and the supposedly ‘obvious’ definition might start slipping from one’s grasp.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-40" id="footnote-169-40-backlink">40</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Rather than seeking out a definition of the word ‘God’ that comes from nowhere, because it is (supposedly) ‘obvious’, I am going to turn to a characteristic practice by which the meaning of the word ‘God’ has been explored within a specific religious tradition. I am going to examine a focal scriptural text that both Jews and Christians have turned to repeatedly when pondering the nature of God: the story of Moses’ encounter with the burning bush in Exodus 3. I am not approaching this text as a historical critic might, trying to identify the precise context in which it was written or tease out its likely meanings in that context. Rather, I am approaching this text as a participant in a tradition of theological thinkers and writers who have found in it the germ of ideas that have proved resilient and generative for their thinking about God, and who have continued to use this text as a sounding board for their ongoing exploration of God’s nature and identity.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-41" id="footnote-169-41-backlink">41</a></span> So, rather than asking what this text meant in whatever Near Eastern context historical research can place it in, I will be asking what meanings it yields when read in the context of this ongoing theological tradition – a tradition that has assumed that the one talked about in this text is the God of the whole Bible, the God of Christian life, the God of the whole creation,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-42" id="footnote-169-42-backlink">42</a></span> and so assumes that it is a text that can be mined for themes and ideas that can to some extent be abstracted from the particular story it tells and fed into a more generalized discussion of the meaning of ‘God’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-43" id="footnote-169-43-backlink">43</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-line-above">Moses stands shoeless in front of the burning bush, receiving a terrifying commission to speak to Pharaoh on behalf of the Israelites – and their God. He anticipates the Israelites asking, ‘What is this god’s name?’ but he is not worrying that they will simply be asking after an extra bit of information about a god they otherwise understand quite well. Moses is expecting them to ask which god is behind this mission, whether this god is friend or foe, and what kind of face this god turns towards them. The God of the burning bush gives Moses three kinds of answer.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">1</span> ‘I am who I am,’ says God. Whatever else it might mean, this is surely in part a claim that this is a God who is not going to be defined, grasped or tied down: this is a God who is free. The Israelites will not gain power over this God by learning how to place and define him; this God will remain in charge and out of their grasp. Who is this God? That’s for God to decide; God will be just who God wants to be.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">It is, in other words, not simply the Israelites’ uncertainty or ignorance that forces the question, ‘Which God?’ It is a question raised by this God’s freedom to transcend and exceed any definitions that the people are capable of producing. The only way to know who or what this God is will be to wait upon the ways in which this God will make Godself known.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">A few verses earlier, on first hearing the voice from the burning bush say, ‘I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham …’, Moses ‘hid his face, for he was afraid to <span class="italic">look</span> at God’ (v.6) – but he did not stop his ears. The freedom that God declares in the name ‘I am who I am’ is allied with this privileging of <span class="italic">hearing</span> God over <span class="italic">seeing</span> God. If you think about seeing something, it is easy to think of yourself as in control, surveying from a good vantage point, inspecting and assessing. After all, you can look at something that is lying in front of you passive and prone. If you think instead about hearing something, it is much less easy to think of yourself as fully in control. You <span class="italic">wait </span>until you are addressed, straining your ears but hearing nothing until the silence is broken by the one for whom you are listening. The reality for which you are listening has to be active. One way of paraphrasing the answer that God gives in verse 14 of this passage would therefore be ‘God said to Moses, “You want to see who I am? Listen!”’ This is, after all, the God who has chosen to <span class="italic">speak</span> to Moses from the burning bush, interrupting the settled pattern of Moses’ life. And, looking more broadly within the Old Testament, this is the God who <span class="italic">speaks</span> to call the world into being, and whose word interrupts the lives of those called to be prophets. This is a God who <span class="italic">addresses</span>, and Moses and the Israelites are not to think of themselves as those who can ‘take God into account’ – cast their eyes over God and fit God into their big picture – but rather as those who are addressed and called to account by this God.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">2</span> A little later on, God repeats the name that God had given right at the beginning of the encounter: ‘The Lord, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’. God points back, in other words, to the stories of the patriarchs, the chiefs of the tribe of the Hebrews before they moved into Egypt. The declaration of God’s freedom is matched with a declaration of God’s faithfulness – a declaration that allows the Israelites to know who this God truly is by looking to the stories of what this God has done.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Note, however, that readers of this text who turn back to the tales of the patriarchs will not find stories there that provide a detailed biography or portrayal of God, or in which God appears directly as a walk-on character (except in Genesis 3). They will find, rather, stories of ancestors who were themselves repeatedly interrupted and addressed by God – and who heard, followed, struggled with and rebelled against this calling God. Moses and the Israelites are pointed to stories in which God is portrayed most often as the invisible and mysterious source of captivating and demanding address, and in which the true character of that address is seen most clearly in the messy lives of those who obey and fail to obey it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Moses and the Israelites are to understand God as the one who addresses them, and as the one whose address has become visible in the interrupted and transformed lives of their ancestors.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Power games</span></p>
				<p class="text">There is another way of reading this declaration, and it is one we should not ignore. The deity of one particular human group – the group of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – is here being claimed as the master of a broader landscape. Look! This God’s writ runs even out here in the wilderness, away from the shrines of the homeland; this is a God capable of making his own shrines! And as the power and reach of this God is stressed, so the power and reach of those associated with this God is strengthened. At the time when this was written there were some in Israel who did not associate themselves with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – and one can imagine them feeling distinctly nervous about this bid for power. You can also imagine some in other nations hearing in it a potential claim on their territory by the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Or you could imagine, coming right up to date, some readers made distinctly uncomfortable by a text in which God declares himself for a succession of exclusively male leaders, and a people defined in terms of its relation to those leaders. And so you might hear a tension between the ungraspability of the God who ‘will be what God will be’ – the God who is not at the Israelites beck and call – and the usefulness of a God who is on ‘our side’.</p>
				<p class="text">This is a theme to which we will be returning. The declaration of faithfulness – the declaration that God can in some way be reliably identified – is always <span class="italic">particular</span>: it is always made in language that belongs more to one group than another, always made in terms that are tangled up in relations of power between communities and individuals. That entanglement is the inevitable price of any claim about God’s identifiability. It is when we consider the Christian identification of God in and with Jesus of Nazareth, and its implications for a world of multiple religions, that we will address this question most directly.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-44" id="footnote-169-44-backlink">44</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">3</span> I have suggested that God identifies Godself by a declaration of freedom, and by a declaration of faithfulness. I have skipped over one part of God’s answer to Moses, however. Moses is to say to the Israelites, ‘I am has <span class="italic">sent me to you</span>.’ Moses is not to tell the Israelites about an interesting encounter that he had one day with a God who has little to do with them. Moses is not even to tell the Israelites an interesting fact about their own back-story: the stories by which this God identifies Godself are not just stories of far away and long ago. To explain who has sent him, Moses is to tell the Israelites of a drama that is set to engulf them and drag them forward to a transformed future. After all, the self-identification that God provides to the Israelites spills over into promises about their future: ‘I declare that I will bring you up out of the misery of Egypt, to … a land flowing with milk and honey.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You might say that the identification God gives to the Israelites at this point is deliberately incomplete. The Israelites will learn the identity of God not simply by paying attention to the stories of what God has done in the past, but by being caught up in a story that is still going on in the present and will lead them on into the future, as God guides them to the Promised Land. This faithful God is free to draw this people on further, to teach them more about who God is and who they should be in response. Remember, after all, that the revelation of God and the giving of the law on Mount Sinai – a revelation that is to take the Israelites into decisively new territory in their understanding of God – is an episode that this story has not yet reached, but towards which it is unstoppably rolling.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Knowledge of this God is not neatly wrapped up and delivered complete via Moses to the Israelites; it is in part <span class="italic">promised </span>to them – held out in front of them to lure them to the future.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Moses and the Israelites are to understand themselves as addressed, and as descendants of others whose interrupted and transformed lives have displayed the address of God. And they are to understand themselves as those who are in turn addressed by one who promises and commands, calling them on a journey to the Promised Land.</p>

								<p class="text">In the light of the questions I raised earlier, we should not forget the fact that the promise made to the Israelites is one of land, and that the story in which they will be engulfed and which will lead them to this land is one of violent conquest. I happen to be writing these words amidst news reports of a war between Israel and Lebanon, and know that this conflict has some of its roots in different ideas about whose promised land Israel/Palestine is. I can’t avoid asking, in this context, whether passages like Exodus 3 reveal Jewish and Christian claims about the identity of God to be irretrievably tied up with the contested claims on territory: the assertion of ‘our’ definition over ‘theirs’.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The whole of 1 John can be read as another attempt to answer the question ‘Who is God?’ – and the connected question, ‘Who should God’s people be in response?’ After all, the epistle begins with a declaration of the identity of God (‘God is light’ – 1.5) and finishes by reaffirming God’s true identity and repudiating misidentifications: ‘He is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourself from idols’ (5.20–21). The present passage contains something of the same interplay between ‘freedom’ and ‘faithfulness’ that we saw in Exodus 3. On the one hand, John insists that ‘No one has ever seen God’, and we once again hear that the knowledge of God that God has made available is not the same sort of knowledge as one might get by inspecting and gaining an overview of some finite object. On the other hand, this passage affirms that knowledge of God is possible because God’s address becomes visible in the stories of those who have been shaped by it. Here, however, it is not the varied responses of the patriarchs to God’s address that are in view, but what John believes is the perfect response of Jesus Christ. It is because of Jesus Christ that 1 John can begin with a flush of confidence in the knowability of God; this letter treats of a truth that has not only been ‘heard’, but ‘looked at’ and even ‘touched’. The author has encountered God’s address in the flesh. And, as the letter proceeds, it becomes clear that what he has encountered has a very specific character. The true God, for John, the one whom he has encountered in Jesus Christ, has become tangible as <span class="italic">love</span>.</p>

								<p class="text">One should beware drawing the definition of this love too narrowly. Jesus said ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind’ and ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself’ (Matthew 22.37–39; Mark 12.29–31; cf. Luke 10.27), but he presented this dual command as a summary of ‘all the law and the prophets’, and was quoting Leviticus 19.18. That passage from Leviticus is itself the climax of a passage that deals with defrauding one’s neighbour, mistreatment of the blind, slander, legal impartiality – all sorts of matters of <span class="italic">justice</span>. When we speak about love in this kind of context, we are not simply referring to a certain kind of feeling, or even to the kind of relationship you might have with those who are especially close to you: it also has to do with how you treat <span class="italic">anyone</span>. That is why I will, from now on, speak interchangeably about ‘love’ and about ‘love and justice’; I am trying to keep this broader definition of love in play.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">We need to tread carefully at this point, however, in order not to oversimplify 1 John’s complex claims. Consider the following steps.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Instead of thinking one could know God in the way one knows ordinary objects, one might first move on to thinking that one might know God simply by knowing <span class="italic">about </span>what God has done – in this case, by knowing about God’s loving address to the world in Jesus of Nazareth.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Further reflection on this passage might suggest a second step, however. One might realize that, for John, one truly knows how God has addressed the world in Jesus Christ only when one knows <span class="italic">oneself</span> to be addressed – only, that is, when the knowledge becomes self-involving.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-46" id="footnote-169-46-backlink">46</a></span></li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Still more reflection on John’s words might suggest a third step. It seems that, for John, to know God is not simply to know about God’s loving address. And it is not simply to recognize oneself as addressed lovingly by God. For one to know God is for one to respond to that address and be transformed by it. One truly knows God only when one has God’s love for the world working through one. One knows God by becoming in this world what God is Godself (v.17).</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">In other words, the knowledge of God that John describes does not take the same form that knowing a fact or believing a theory take. Rather, John is talking about his readers being transformed until they become, as it were, conduits for the reality they are trying to know – until not just their minds, but their whole lives get won into correspondence with God. To ‘know’ God is to become a participant in the same love and justice that God has shown to the world in Christ. This is a reality that a person knows – <span class="italic">only</span> knows – when it meets her, captivates her and begins working in and through her.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Exclusive Love?</span></p>
				<p class="text">Lest we think that this New Testament passage poses none of the questions that we saw in the Old Testament passage discussed on page 35, we should note the strong sense of separation from the world that pervades John’s letters. Does John speak of a God who is known by those who find an <span class="italic">exclusive</span> love working within them – a love restricted to this specific community, and kept from the wider world? This is, after all, a letter that says ‘Do not love the world!’ (1 John 2.15) and condemns as liars and antichrists those who have left the community.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-47" id="footnote-169-47-backlink">47</a></span> </p>

					<li class="bullet-list">To know God is to know <span class="italic">oneself</span> to be addressed in this way, and to know oneself to be called to share in this love.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">More than that, to know God is to respond to that call, and by becoming loving to become like God.</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-5"><span class="bold">God’s music</span></p>
				<p class="text">What does it mean to say that one can know a reality only by living in a way that responds to it, or by participating in it, or by having it working through one? We can mean all sorts of different things when we say ‘I know x’. I know that the Battle of Hastings took place in 1066; I know I have a slight headache coming on; and I know some of my students quite well. Is knowledge of God like the first of these? Does it have at its heart one’s ability to provide a correct account – a collection of true statements about God? Is it like the second? Does it have at its heart some kind of ‘internal’ awareness? Is it like the third? Does it have at its heart involvement in an ongoing story of interactions between oneself and God, and knowledge of God’s similar stories with others in the past?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The Johannine ideas that I’ve been exploring suggest that it is not quite like any of these (even if it may include elements of all of them). It suggests another model of knowing – one that is rather like the kind of knowing that takes place when one knows a piece of music, if one sings or plays it. The piece of music is, after all, something objective: it has an existence beyond me; I have to learn it and it makes sense to say that I can get it wrong. As I learn it, however, the distance between me and the piece of music starts shrinking. I can work on the piece until performing it ‘becomes second nature’ (which means, if you take it literally, ‘until it becomes a new definition of who I am’). And while performing the piece remains something that <span class="italic">I</span> am doing, I can become so caught up in the piece of music that there’s almost a sense in which it is the music that plays me. I become an instrument on which this piece of music plays itself out. I might start finding it difficult to know how to relate claims about what I do to claims about what the piece of music does – how the power of the music works on me, shaping me to itself. In the end, I might say that I become one of the ways in which this piece of music is present and active in the world.</p>

No matter how fraught our lives have been over the last couple of days, no matter how abrasive our disputes about people or politics, or how visceral our differences about what we are to play and how we are to play it, it reminds us that we are, when it comes to it, one. We try not to look at each other when we play this scale; no one appears to lead. Even the first upbeat is merely breathed by Piers, not indicated by any movement of his head. When I play this I release myself into the spirit of the quartet. I become the music of the scale. I mute my will, I free my self.’</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">‘As [God] is, so are we in this world’ (1 John 4.17). If one follows John, then one might think of God as being like a melody playing eternally, and of knowledge of God as consisting in one’s ability to play that melody oneself – or, rather, as the discovery that one can <span class="italic">be played by</span> that melody, becoming an aspect of that melody’s presence in the world. To know the God who lovingly addresses the world is to become one who loves with a godly love – or, rather, it is to have God’s love and justice become what is happening in and through one. To know God is to be won by God into a godly life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This is a way of thinking about knowledge that blurs the distinction between <span class="italic">knowing how</span> and <span class="italic">knowing that</span>. I know <span class="italic">how </span>to ride a bike; I know <span class="italic">that </span>my desk is made from pine. If knowledge of God is as I have been suggesting, however, then to know <span class="italic">that </span>God is love (to know what God is like, what sort of reality God is) and to have been taught <span class="italic">how </span>to live a godly life are inseparable, almost identical. One has learnt something about the melody that is God only when one has learnt to have that something present in one’s performance of the melody. Conversely, everything one learns about performing the melody more truly is a form of learning about the melody itself. One cannot separate learning how to live a godly life from learning the identity of God. To know God is to be caught up in the love and justice that are God’s life – to ‘become participants in the divine nature’ (2 Peter 1.4).</p>

But the return of the believer home to his origin, as to his end, is the fulfilment of his longing. Now the fulfilment of his longing is the rest of the loving heart in eternal motion around the beloved. But the rest of the loving heart in eternal motion around the beloved is eternal, immediate delight, … participation in the supernatural blessings of God.

				<p class="text-line-below">Of course, my musical analogy can only be pushed so far. In particular, it is not very good at capturing the sense of God’s freedom – the living and active independence of the one who says ‘I am who I am.’ Perhaps instead I should augment the metaphor somewhat and add the <span class="italic">composer</span> of the piece of music into the picture. That would enable me to speak of the music of God’s life now as the free action of a divine composer, and I would be able to say not just that I know God when I ‘become the music’ that God has composed, but also that I know God by <span class="italic">acknowledging </span>that this music is a gift, coming to me with love from a free source – acknowledging that it has been addressed to me, and that I am therefore being caught up in a music that is <span class="italic">someone’s</span>.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Thanksgiving</span></p>
				<p class="text">For Christian theology, knowledge of God involves both living the life of love into which God calls one and acknowledging the source of that life. That does not mean, however, that it has a thoroughly practical aspect (loving), coupled with a thoroughly theoretical aspect (acknowledgement), because the characteristic form that this acknowledgement takes is not some intellectual acceptance, but <span class="italic">thanksgiving</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I recently had a conversation with a Christian friend who said that she was not yet praying with her three-year-old daughter because her daughter could not yet understand what ‘God’ meant. She thought that, given this inevitable lack of understanding, ‘praying’ wouldn’t be real; it would all be a game, a pretence – not really prayer at all.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">My wife and I explained that we <span class="italic">did </span>play the praying game with our two-year-old every night, using a standard prayer that begins ‘Dear God, thank you for Bridget’s day; thank you for x; thank you for y; thank you for z …’ – with the x, y and z being suggested by Bridget. (A typical list might include ‘thank you for dinner, thank you for ice cream’, and so on).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yes, it is a game; and no, this two-year-old did not understand what ‘God’ meant in any sense that would have satisfied our friend. Our argument, however, was that this game was precisely <span class="italic">how</span> our daughter was learning what ‘God’ means. She understood ‘thanking’ pretty well, as an expression of some kind of delight at things that have happened during the day; she was beginning to understand the idea of thanking <span class="italic">someone</span>, so that ‘God’ was beginning to mean for her ‘the one to whom we say thank you for anything and everything’. And that, it seems to us, is a very large part indeed of what is involved in understanding what ‘God’ means. By learning to thank, Bridget was learning the nature of God.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-8">Exercise</p>
				<p class="text">What else could we have been doing with or saying to our toddler to help her learn what ‘God’ means?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In order to do justice to John’s insights, however, I would need to say that God<span class="italic"> </span>does not simply compose or perform this music; he <span class="italic">is</span> this music – and at this point the analogy begins to slip from my fingers. After all, John does not just say that God loves, but that God <span class="italic">is</span> love. In other words, the conviction of this text appears to be not simply that one does (or could) know lots about God already, and might then find out one extra thing, that this God who one already knows is <span class="italic">also </span>a God who loves. No, for this text the primary thing, the controlling thing, the first thing, in some ways the <span class="italic">only </span>thing one knows about God is this love and justice.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Suppose I were telling you about the spring of a mountain stream. I might tell you that this spring was located on a patch of moorland and emerged from a certain crack in the rock. If I were telling you how to find the spring, I might say, ‘Look out for the rock that is heavy, limestone, cracked and shaped like a pulpit; <span class="italic">that’s </span>the spring.’ I would be saying that, in addition to having all those other properties (being heavy, made of limestone and so on) this rock is <span class="italic">also</span> the source of the water. Of course, you might respond (if you were a pedant) by saying, ‘No, you don’t mean that: the rock itself is not the spring; it is <span class="italic">the crack in the rock </span>that is the spring.’ I, trying to be even more pedantic, might answer, ‘Not even the crack; the rock and the crack in it are simply where we <span class="italic">find</span> the spring; the spring itself is the water bubbling up in that place.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-50" id="footnote-169-50-backlink">50</a></span> The spring, logically speaking, is simply the start of the stream; the spring is that-without-which-there-would-be-no-stream. The spring <span class="italic">is</span> (the beginning of) the stream, and the stream <span class="italic">is</span> (the continuation of) the spring. And, of course, if we are being this pedantic then the spring itself cannot be described as heavy, limestone, cracked, or shaped like a pulpit, because we can’t say that the bubbling-up-of-the-water is heavy, or limestone, or any of those things. The only words we will properly use to describe the characteristics of the spring will be words that describe the emerging-of-the-water – the spring is ‘fast’, perhaps, or ‘pure’, or ‘constant’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">John’s usage seems to be a little like this. He is not telling us that (as we all know) the word ‘God’ means an all-powerful, all-knowing being – and that Christians believe that this powerful, knowing being is <span class="italic">also </span>the source of the love that they have encountered. He is telling us that the word ‘God’ refers to the emerging-of-this-love; God is that-without-which-there-would-be-no-love. God <span class="italic">is </span>this love, and this love <span class="italic">is </span>God. Any other qualities that can be predicated of this God will be qualities of the-emerging-of-this-love. This is, for John, simply what the word ‘God’ means – and at this stage it is still an open question as to whether it will be appropriate to say of this source any of the other things that people have wanted to say about ‘God’ – an open question whether we will want to go on and say that this emerging-of-love, this spring of love, is all-powerful, or all-knowing, or personal, or whatever. In the beginning, Christian theology knows only one thing about God: God <span class="italic">is</span> love.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">To the question, ‘Who is God’, I am suggesting that the proper Christian answer is not, in the first place, ‘God is an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being’ but ‘Look at the love and justice that pours forth in Christ, and that are, however weakly and inadequately, welling up in our lives and in the world. Well, God is the source of that: that love and justice <span class="italic">is</span> God’s life, pouring through us. And yes, that life is, we believe, invincible and it is present everywhere, so we might start using words like “omnipotent” and “omnipresent” – but only because the first thing that we say is “God is love.”’</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The two powers of God</span></p>
				<p class="text">There was, in late medieval theology, a popular way of explaining God’s power that got dangerously close to denying this absolute priority of love. Theologians like the medieval English Franciscan William of Ockham spoke of God’s free decision to enter into a covenant with the world, and distinguished between God’s ‘absolute power’ (<span class="italic">potentia absoluta</span>), the ability of God to choose whether or not to enter into this covenant, and God’s ‘ordained power’ (<span class="italic">potentia ordinata</span>), the freedom of action that God has left Godself within this chosen covenant. According to Ockham and others, while God is at heart absolutely free and absolutely powerful (<span class="italic">potentia absoluta</span>), God has used that freedom to decide for a course of action that now limits what options are available to God (<span class="italic">potentia ordinata</span>): God’s freedom is restricted, but only by God’s own free decision.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">At first sight, this way of explaining matters, though somewhat technical, may sound like it is simply a spelling out of what is involved in the whole idea of God ‘entering into a covenant’: one must be able to speak of God both as free to enter into the covenant and (God’s having done so) of God as bound by it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">While this is probably an unobjectionable distinction if, by it, one means that it is possible to imagine other ways in which God could have expressed God’s love, it can be taken in another, more worrying way. It can instead suggest that love was a choice made by God, which God could have made otherwise, and that behind love there simply stands an absolutely unrestricted power of God – a power that could equally well have shown itself in hatred, had God chosen differently. God is a composer who has chosen to write a love melody, but God could equally well have chosen to compose a music of spite. To put it colloquially but appropriately, the danger of this ‘two powers’ theology is the suggestion that, deep down, God could have been whatever the hell God chose.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-51" id="footnote-169-51-backlink">51</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-9"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The word ‘God’ in Christian theology refers first and foremost to the source of the love that addresses the world in Jesus Christ.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">One cannot separate the identity of God from the stream of love into which one is drawn by this address.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Praise and thanksgiving are the characteristic forms in which God is acknowledged as the source of that stream.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-10"><span class="bold">Learning to love</span></p>
				<p class="text">To know the Christian God is to know oneself to be addressed lovingly by God in Jesus Christ. More than that, to know the Christian God is to know oneself called by that address to become loving. And even more than that, to know the Christian God is to become loving, with this same love. One knows God by having the love and justice of God that poured forth in Christ welling up within one’s life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">For Christian theology, then, God’s loving address in Christ is the criterion for one’s own love. John, after all, paints his readers as those who <span class="italic">should </span>love perfectly but who as yet love imperfectly, and who therefore need to learn to love better. And he believes that they can learn the character of true love, of godly love, in Christ – because the address that God made to the world in Christ was both a <span class="italic">call </span>to love and justice, and a revelation of the true <span class="italic">meaning </span>of love and justice.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Penitence</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In the church in which I grew up, the liturgical introduction leading up to prayers of penitence included a quotation from 1 John 1.8:</p>
				<p class="text">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-52" id="footnote-169-52-backlink">52</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This is no accident. If the kind of knowledge of God that John speaks of involves both loving with a Christlike love, and also recognizing the present inadequacy of one’s love, then it will be marked by <span class="italic">penitence</span>. You might even say that prayers of penitence are one of the characteristic forms in which Christian knowledge of God is embodied.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The idea of ‘learning to love’ might seem an odd one. It is easy to think that one either loves someone or does not, and that there is not much one can do about it if one does not.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-53" id="footnote-169-53-backlink">53</a></span> However, although that might be true of ‘being in love’, it is not true if one takes a broader and deeper definition of love. Consider, for instance, my love for my children. Of course, there is one sense in which that love is simply <span class="italic">there</span>: a matter beyond my will and control. There are all sorts of ways, however, in which I do need to <span class="italic">learn</span> to love them. I might need to learn, for instance, that some of what I think of as lovingly doing my best for them is actually my attempt to live my life again through them. I might need to learn that my supposedly loving refusal to say ‘no’ to them is actually damaging them, and at root a form of selfishness. I might need to learn that some of my ways of showing love to them are actually fed and distorted by my need to get certain kinds of responses from them, in order to feel valued. The list could go on: there are all sorts of ways in which I might need to learn that I have mistaken the nature of true love for them, and need to be taught it.</p>

				<p class="exercise-box-heading-no-space"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">Try reading Jane Austen’s <span class="italic">Emma</span>,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-54" id="footnote-169-54-backlink">54</a></span> and watch how Emma learns that what she takes to be her kind and thoughtful care – her love – for her friend Harriet is in fact a form of selfishness.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">It is because love in this fuller sense needs to be learnt that this passage from 1 John – and, in general, the whole epistle from which it comes – insists on keeping together the knowledge of God that its readers will find by loving one another and the knowledge of God that they will find in the recognition of God’s love in Christ. It keeps flitting from one to the other – saying, for instance, that we have God abiding in us if we abide in love¸ and that we abide in God if we confess that Jesus Christ is from God. To believe in Christ and to learn to love are not, for John’s theology, two separate things. It therefore makes no sense to say, ‘Why couldn’t John have said all this wonderful stuff about love without harping on all the time about “belief in Christ” as well?’ For John, commitment to love cannot be separated from discipleship to the Christ who teaches the world love’s true nature.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">God is, according to this theology, the reality that one knows – that one <span class="italic">only</span> knows – when one has God’s love working on, in and through one. But the journey towards godly love is an endless one, and it is a journey on which Christians believe that they are led by Christ’s constant tutelage.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">I have been suggesting that Christian knowledge of God should not be thought of as being like simple knowledge of a fact, nor like knowledge of a theory, nor even like knowledge of an experience. The reality of God is not like other realities, and so the God is not known in the way that other realities are known. I have suggested instead that a person can be said to know God only if that person’s whole life is being drawn into conformity to God – becoming loving as God is loving, and just as God is just. More precisely, I have suggested that knowledge of God does not simply consist in a static resemblance between God’s love and the believer’s love, but that it consists in the ongoing process by which the believer’s love is actively shaped into ever deeper conformity to God. As (in one’s own particular situation) one learns to love, as one learns justice, one is learning the nature of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Christian knowledge of God, I have argued, can therefore be thought of as an interplay between:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">the believer’s grateful recognition of God as the one who loves her and as the one who is the ultimate source of her love;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">the believer’s active living out of godly love and justice in the world;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">the believer’s penitent recognition of God’s loving address in Christ as the criterion for her love; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">the believer’s discovery that God’s loving address in Jesus Christ is the spur to ever deeper love and justice.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">One might say that in knowing God Christians know something <span class="italic">unplumbable</span> – a reality that they can never finish exploring, and so a reality of which there can be no final map, no finished representation. The only kind of representation that one can have of such a God is found in the moving image of lives exploring ever deeper, learning ever more of God’s love and justice; God is known as the one to whom such lives are the appropriate response, and of whom such lives are the only true representation. God’s life is the life into which these lives are drawn.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-11"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">To know God is to be caught up by God into the love and justice that are God’s life, and to acknowledge the source of that love.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Love needs to be learnt and, for Christian theology, Christ is the supreme teacher.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Prayers of penitence will be one characteristic expression of the process by which love is learnt.</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-12"><span class="bold">Knowing in particular</span></p>
				<p class="text">One only performs a piece of music by performing it in particular ways at particular times and places. Of course, there are plenty of generalities involved in such performances: one learns things about notes and scales and keys and rhythms that are the same anywhere and everywhere. But when it comes to an actual performance, the event in which it can truly be said that one knows the piece of music, all those generalities become subservient to the particular occasion, shaped by particular circumstances in ways that are unrepeatable. For most traditional forms of music, after all, it does not make sense to think that there could be a final performance of a piece, a performance so ‘accurate’ or complete that the piece would never need to be performed live again.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Similarly, if knowledge of God consists in living a godly life, a life of Christlike love and justice, then one only lives such a life by living it in particular ways at particular times and places. Of course, there might be all sorts of generalities involved, but in the end knowledge of God consists in the particular ways in which God’s life is lived by particular people in their own place in the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What it means to learn Christlike love will look one way for a middle-class mother of two in Nairobi; it will look another for a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank; it will look another for an isolated single pensioner in Detroit, it will look another way for the abused daughter of a paedophile in São Paulo; it will look another for the English vicar of a large set of rural parishes; it will look another for the owner of a garment factory in Beijing. In each of those widely differing, infinitely complex lives, learning to love under the tutelage of Christ will be a long, costly and perhaps bewildering process; it will involve engagement with the realities and constraints of the context in ways that people outside will be in no position to understand fully. It will involve the reshaping of each person’s particular individual history, and particular psychology; it will involve each of those people learning how to respond to and live with particular others who stand in specific relations to him or her; it will involve doing this in the context of a particular history, a particular culture, a particular political setting. Love and justice are learnt as particular people learn to love particular others in particular contexts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course there will be all sorts of connections and commonalities between what love means for each of these people; of course there will be much that they can learn from each other, and much that they can learn from those who have thought about and explored love in the past. There is nevertheless no getting away from the need for each person to learn in his or her context, amongst the people close to him or her. Each person will learn in ways that will have a good deal to do with personal growth and development, with the task of building working friendships and family relationships, and with larger scale questions of social responsibility and political engagement.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In what does a piece of music’s existence in the world consist? In a score, written down carefully and stored in a composer’s archive? No: it consists in the multiple performances of the piece of music in thousands of different venues and times – performances that often feed off each other, as people learn to perform by hearing others perform and by reflecting on their own earlier performances, but performances that are nevertheless in the end all different. Just so, we might say that the kind of knowledge of God spoken of by John properly consists in the whole gamut of particular ways in which people live God’s life in the world, and in their interconnection.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">All this means that, if one wants to find experts in the knowledge of God, one shouldn’t necessarily turn to academic theologians. Those who know God most profoundly are the ‘saints’ – those who have been so taken over by the music of God that their whole lives resonate to it; those who have been led deeper into the discovery of how to live the life of Christ in their own place and time. The expertise of academic theologians is an entirely secondary matter: it is a commentary upon such true ‘expertise’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-55" id="footnote-169-55-backlink">55</a></span></p>

It might mix interviews with players, clips from earlier performances, illustrated discussion of various basics about how performance works. Watching the programme, however, would not itself make you a performer; it would not even demonstrate that you wanted to become a performer. And similarly, to say that knowledge of God is inseparably bound up with the living of godly lives, and to say that this book is about knowledge of God, does not mean that you have to be committed to a godly life in order to read it and understand it, nor that your life will be made more godly if you do read and understand it. It does mean, however, that this book can’t try to deal with the ‘theoretical’ aspects of the knowledge of God in abstraction from real godly lives, any more than the television programme could be about musical performance without ever looking at musical performers.

				<p class="text">Chad Pecknold writes this of Saint Augustine of Hippo (354–430):</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">There are few lives that have had as much attention as the life of Saint Augustine of Hippo. This is because he sought a vision of God that was inseparable from lived reality – including the reality of his own life. In his <span class="italic">Confessions</span>, Augustine recounts his childhood, his adolescence, his sexual life, his relationships with friends and family, and through all of this, he seeks to recognize and make known his relationship with God. His account in the <span class="italic">Confessions</span> of who God is is inseparable from his account of his own life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A central point of Augustine’s theology is that one’s vision of God is inextricably united to a whole way of life in which human desire is well-ordered. To know God truly is to desire – to love – rightly, a matter not simply of correct ideas but of godly life, individually and corporately. It is not surprising, then, that Augustine’s theological descriptions are infused with narrative: the narratives of his own life, the narratives of the Roman Empire – and pre-eminently, the narratives of Scripture.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Augustine learned to understand his own story not by being provided with lessons in abstract theology, but in the light of the scriptural story. From very early on, at the age of 18, he struggled to read the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, and found it rhetorically vulgar and uncultured. His extraordinary intellectual abilities were more attracted to Cicero and Virgil, Plotinus and Porphyry. His intellectual journey was such that he advanced to become an ambitious professor of Rhetoric (the training ground for the best imperial politicians) through teaching posts in Carthage, Rome and finally, in Milan. It was in Milan, however, that Augustine came under the influence of Saint Ambrose, the bishop of that city, whose preaching of the scriptural narrative so impressed the 30-year-old that he began radically to question his life. In the summer of 386, Augustine wept in a Milanese garden with some friends, despairing of a life that seemed to him disordered. He heard a small child singing a nursery song, rhythmically chanting ‘<span class="italic">tolle lege</span>, <span class="italic">tolle lege</span>’, which means ‘take up and read, take up and read.’ Augustine interpreted these words as a sign of God commanding him to ‘take up and read’ the Scriptures. And so he did. And he tells us that the key verse impressed upon him by God was ‘put on the Lord Jesus Christ’ (Romans 13.13–14) – a command, that is, to put on not a set of ideas but a life. Through this text, truth is revealed, and Augustine finds peace with God, finds that the darkness of his doubts, his anxieties, and his tears are relieved, and finds a scriptural ‘light’ infusing his heart and mind. Suddenly he could read the Scriptures in a new way, and effectively read his life in a new way too. What was this new way? What did ‘putting on the Lord Jesus Christ’ mean? It meant hearing God’s word not as abstract philosophy inadequately couched in messy and vulgar stories, but as revolving around the life of Jesus Christ, who is God’s Word made flesh, made life, for the sake of our salvation. Augustine came to believe that putting on this identity – being shaped into its likeness – transforms how we read, and enables us to participate in a therapy of desire which can teach us how to live lives (individual and communal) that perform God’s love for the world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-56" id="footnote-169-56-backlink">56</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">If we return to the question of the first chapter, then, and ask what sense Christians can and should make of their lives, a first approximation would be to say that Christians see themselves as being drawn, in all their particular locations in time and space, into the life of God – or, more fully, that they find themselves being drawn into that Christlike love and justice which are the life of God. That is, I am suggesting, in broadest outline the plot of the story that Christians can use to make sense of the messy data of their communal and individual lives: they are on a journey into the life of God.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-7-13"><span class="bold">Key point</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">For Christian theology, knowledge of God is seen only in particular lives lived in particular contexts – the lives of those who have heard the call of God, and have begun to learn Christlike love.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Going further</span></p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The unknowability of God is a theme that has been explored most fully in mystical theology – that central strand of classic Christian theology that has concerned itself with precisely these questions of God’s unknowability and the possibility of participation in God’s life. I have already mentioned Mark McIntosh’s <span class="italic">Mystical Theology </span>(Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), which is a good introduction; Denys Turner’s <span class="italic">The Darkness of God: Negativity in Christian Mysticism</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998) is a difficult but illuminating exploration if you want to go deeper.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The idea of participation in God’s life – divinization or <span class="italic">theosis</span> – is an unfamiliar one to many modern Western Christians. It is, however, deeply embedded in the Christian tradition. The Russell book that I cited in the introduction to this chapter provides the best survey of the origins of this way of thinking – Jewish, biblical and patristic – but for some glimpses of <span class="italic">theosis</span> in other contexts, see Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson (eds), <span class="italic">Union with Christ: The New Finnish Interpretation of Luther </span>(Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1998); A. M. Allchin, <span class="italic">Participation: A Forgotten Strand in Anglican Tradition</span> (London: DLT, 1988); and Michael J. Christensen, ‘Theosis and Sanctification: John Wesley’s Reformulation of a Patristic Doctrine’, <span class="italic">Wesleyan Theological Journal</span> 31.2 (1996), available online at the Wesley Center Online, http://wesley.nnu.edu/wesleyan_theology/theojrnl/31–35/31–2–4.htm.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Is all this talk of ‘God’ <span class="italic">simply</span> a way in which Christians make sense of their lives and their world? Would answering ‘yes’ take us in the direction of theological non-realism, denying that there is any straightforward sense in which God is a reality prior to Christian sense-making, to which that sense-making must conform itself? Do I fall into the ‘theological realist’ camp if I say that Christians can’t but make sense of their lives as not <span class="italic">just</span> their lives, and their world as not <span class="italic">just</span> their world, but have to make sense of them as given, held and loved? The issues here are complex ones, but a good introduction to the debate can be found in Colin Crowder (ed.), <span class="italic">God and Reality: Essays in Christian Non-Realism </span>(London: Mowbray, 1997) and  an impressive response in Andrew Moore, <span class="italic">Realism and Christian Faith: God, Grammar and Meaning</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">If you want to take further my comments about theology’s proper currency being biography, it is worth tracking down a copy of James W. McClendon’s <span class="italic">Biography as Theology: How Life Stories Can Remake Today’s Theology</span> (Nashville, TN: Abingdon, 1974). He not only presents four biographies, but reflects carefully on what theological use can be made of them. As David Burrell puts it in a review, ‘McClendon’s conceptual point is that religious affirmations take their meaning from the manner in which communities show they can be lived out, and that communities take heart and direction from those individuals who dare to embody what they proclaim.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-57" id="footnote-169-57-backlink">57</a></span></li>

To someone who does not share those assumptions – say, an atheist scholar of Near Eastern historical texts – it is bound to look highly dubious.</p>

On the one hand, it has to do with living with, and learning to name God from, a lot of biblical and traditional stories about God addressing individuals and communities (whatever one thinks about the literal truth behind those stories); on the other hand, it has to do with a sense, however ambiguous, uncertain and undramatic it might be, that one simply can’t get away from taking the God of those stories seriously, as the God of one’s own life.</p>
