				<p class="text">I have repeated many times the claim that Christians can understand themselves <span class="italic">and their world </span>as being drawn into the life of God. That way of putting things – as well as many of the specific points I have made along the way, particularly in Chapter 11 – raises the question of the <span class="italic">scope</span> of salvation. So this chapter will continue the discussion of the last, but asks whether there is anyone who will <span class="italic">not</span> be saved. There is the general version of that question – <span class="italic">Will God save everyone?</span> – but there is also the more specific version – <span class="italic">What about other religions?</span> What place can other religions have in this Trinitarian and Incarnational theological vision?</p>

				<p class="text-line-below">There has been a universalizing flavour to much of what I have been saying in this book as a whole and in the last chapter in particular: I have spoken of God drawing the world to Godself, of God accepting the world, and so on. Does this mean that all people are being, and will be, saved? In order to explore this question, I am going to spend some time examining a long passage in Paul’s letter to the Romans in which he argues about matters that touch on these questions.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Paul begins chapter 9 filled with ‘great sorrow and unceasing anguish’ (9.2) at the thought that his people (the Jews) will not be saved. If he could trade his salvation for theirs, being condemned so that they could be acquitted, he would. ‘I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my own people’ (9.3).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Part of his anguish stems from his knowledge that the Jews are the chosen people, the recipients of God’s promises (9.4). How can they now not be saved? Has God given up on his promises? Has he abandoned his people, de-selected his chosen ones? Is God unfaithful? (9.6)</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The whole of Romans 9 to 11 is an extended attempt to answer this question. And it is a fascinating and extraordinarily complex biblical text. It is one of those texts that forces one to abandon forms of exegesis that take verses in isolation, out of context: it is a complex argument that only really makes sense – quite surprising sense – when one reaches the end. Rather than being the calm laying out of a settled clutch of opinions, presented in bullet-point form to his audience, in the first-century equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation, it bears all the hallmarks of being a struggle: ideas worked out on the go, conclusions established and then challenged, set up and then undermined, as Paul works towards a conclusion that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">He begins with a simple argument. We cannot accuse God of abandoning Israel, if we understand the definition of Israel properly. ‘Israel’ has always meant those whom God calls and keeps, not those who happen to be descendants of Abraham (9.8). Look, Paul says (9.7–13): both Ishmael and Isaac were descendants of Abraham, both Jacob and Esau, yet God chose to favour Isaac and Jacob (younger sons in both cases). Israel has always been, right from the time of the patriarchs, whoever God chose it to be – and God has always felt free to ignore the most obvious descendants (the eldest sons) in favour of strange and wayward protégés. So if God chooses for true Israel now not to coincide exactly with the Jewish people, so be it. It is entirely in line with what God has done before. And we cannot accuse God of breaking God’s promises – unless we accuse God of breaking them right back at the beginning, in those very first generations of Abraham’s descendants who show us what these promises <span class="italic">mean</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul appears to have got God off the hook, but only by catching him on another one. Isn’t the picture of God that Paul has painted deeply unfair? (9.14) Yes, we cannot strictly accuse God of breaking his promises – but doesn’t God deal with people in an intolerably arbitrary way? God is faced with two equally deserving sons of Abraham or two equally deserving sons of Isaac – equal claimants standing before God’s throne – and God chooses to be nice to one brother and nasty to the other, irrespective of what they are like. That, surely, is unfair. But Paul suggests – if I understand him rightly – that to put the objection like this is to get the question the wrong way round. It is not that we start with equally deserving sons, and then one gets condemned and another saved. Rather, God chooses to bring into being an elected son and a reprobate son, and God shapes the reprobate son so as to display hardness of heart and rejection by God, and shapes the elect son so as to display obedience and acceptance by God (9.17–18). The decision that God makes (to elect or reject) matches exactly the overall shape of each son’s life, because each son’s life is shaped toward the decision that God has made. It cannot be said to be treating two equal claimants unequally: one son <span class="italic">is </span>undeserving (because he is reprobate), the other <span class="italic">is </span>deserving (because he is elect).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In line with my earlier discussions of providence, one might think of God as a novelist writing a novel in which there is a bad character who eventually gets condemned and a good character who eventually gets saved. It does not make sense to think of the novelist as faced, before she puts pen to paper, with two equally deserving cases and deciding unfairly to condemn one and to save the other. That is simply not an intelligible way to talk about what is going on. The condemnation and the salvation are deeply appropriate to the respective natures of the characters that the novelist has brought into existence for this very purpose.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul then has to deal with another difficulty that this argument has thrown up (9.19). If one thinks of those who are not saved, those with hard hearts, simply as characters who were written that way by God – characters who never in any meaningful sense had a chance to be anything different, can one really hold them responsible for what they do? (The reprobate son will, as Paul says, ask ‘Why have you made me like this? – 9.20). Isn’t God still being unfair in writing bad characters in the first place?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul’s response at this point in his argument seems simply to be: ‘Look, God can do what he wants. He’s God. Full stop; end of debate.’ But actually his argument is a little more subtle than that. Certainly he says, in effect, ‘Who are you to question God’s methods?’ (9.21–22) But he goes on to begin explaining what he thinks God has achieved – what God’s <span class="italic">ends</span> were. So his argument is something more like: ‘Who are you to question God’s methods: what overview have you got of other ways in which God could have achieved God’s purposes? What insight have you got into what is possible and what is impossible?’ Paul then directs attention to what God has, in fact, achieved: God has made known God’s forbearance, in God’s patient handling of those destined for destruction, and God has made known God’s glorious mercy, in allowing some to share God’s life (9.22–23). Going back to our novelist example, it is as if Paul is arguing that the novelist has brought her good character and her bad character into existence, and given them their respective fates, precisely so as to show us the nature of just and measured condemnation and merciful, gratuitous salvation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">At this point, Paul’s argument seems to be complete. The remainder of chapter 9 is spent restating the fact that it is perfectly in line with God’s activity depicted in the Old Testament that God should have chosen to save a remnant of Israel and some of the Gentiles, rather than simply saving Israel – and hinting at the fact that the distinction between who is elected and who is rejected is displayed in how people react to Jesus the stumbling block.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You may not, however, be satisfied that Paul has given a completely adequate answer. More to the point, I don’t think <span class="italic">Paul </span>is satisfied with where he has got to by this point. He started with a cry of anguish about the apparent loss of salvation by his people. He has ended up by saying that God has brought some people into existence purely in order to reject them, and that God has done this in order to reveal God’s nature. If we ask, <span class="italic">to whom</span> is this revelation made, then the answer must surely be that it is primarily to the elect (they are, after all, the ones who recognize what God is doing) – so Paul’s argument is tantamount to the claim that some people are rejected in order to complete and perfect the salvation of those who are elected. The reprobate are there to ice the elect’s cake. Paul began by saying that he would willingly be condemned if it could only mean the salvation of his rejected people – and yet he has ended up by saying, in effect, that it’s okay really because those people have been unwillingly rejected so that he could be saved. The answer doesn’t quite scratch where Paul is itching.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, at the beginning of chapter 10, Paul returns to the anguish with which he began: his ‘heart’s desire and prayer … that they might be saved’ (10.1). He tries to understand how it is that they could be condemned – not now in terms of God’s overarching providential schemes, but in terms of how election and rejection play themselves out in people’s lives. It is not to do with a lack of zeal on the part of the Jews: God has not hardened their hearts by dulling their desire (10.2). Rather, it is a lack of understanding, a lack of enlightenment, a lack of recognition – a lack of that flash of insight into what is going on in Jesus which leads some to confess and believe (10.6–13). Just as the novelist writes about a bad character who is condemned, and a good character who is saved, God brings into being the un-elect who hear about Jesus but do not see what is going on in him, do not confess and believe, and so are condemned, and the elect who hear about Jesus and do recognize what is going on in him, do confess and believe, and so are saved. And the ones who are chosen for salvation in this way, Paul stresses again, can be Gentiles just as easily as they can be Jews (10.19–21).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Having restated in these more detailed terms the basic problem with which he started (the desperately sad fact that the majority of his fellow Jews have not turned to Christ) Paul at the beginning of chapter 11 returns to the question that he had apparently solved in chapter 9: ‘Has God rejected his people?’ (11.1). Has God broken God’s promises?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul reiterates in slightly different words the answer he has already given: no, God has not rejected his people – he has simply chosen to save a remnant of them (as was often the case in the Old Testament). Verses 1 to 10 add little to the argument he has already given, leaving one to wonder what unfinished business Paul felt he had with this topic to make him re-cover the ground so quickly.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">But then, in verses 11 and 12 of chapter 11, he makes a breakthrough into a new way of putting things, which sets all that he has said so far in a new context:</p>
				<p class="quotes">11So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. 12Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">What if, he says, the condemnation is not final? He has argued, in effect, that some are condemned for the sake of those who are chosen – to complete and perfect the gifts given to those who are chosen. What if condemnation is not the final word for those who suffer it? What if the stumbling to which God has condemned them is not the final word? What if God also intends to save them? How much greater is the gift given to the elect if, instead simply of seeing that some are condemned in order to make way for their election, they see that those they thought condemned are also rescued alongside them. How much more glorious is that? (11.12)</p>
				<p class="text-indent">At first, Paul describes this as if it were simply a case that the saving of some Gentiles might provoke some Jews to jealousy – so increasing the size of the remnant of Israel who will be saved. He presents it, in other words, as a partial amelioration of the condemnation of most of Israel (11.14).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But by verse 25, Paul has taken a further step. ‘I want you to understand this mystery’ he says. That is, ‘I want you to listen to a secret – something you could not simply have deduced from what you already know, something that is a fresh insight into the ways of God – you might even call it a revelation.’ ‘A hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved.’ (11.25) We are no longer dealing with a slight blurring at the edges of the harsh and sharp picture that Paul had painted in chapter 9. We are dealing with a claim that puts that picture in an utterly different light.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">God is not a novelist who has written a novel with a bad character who gets condemned and a good character who gets saved. The plot is far more complex than that. Yes, God has made it so that the majority of Israel fail to recognize Jesus. And yes God has done that for the sake of the salvation of the Gentiles, so that they can be grafted in. But in turn God has arranged for the salvation of the Gentiles in order to win the stumbling Jews back as well. His intention all along has been to save both Jew and Gentile, and the condemnation that he has inflicted has only ever been a temporary measure, designed to further and deepen salvation. God has not abandoned the Jewish people – historical Israel, genetic Israel. They are beloved (11.28). God’s promises – Paul is finally able to say this cleanly and truly, with no qualifications or get-out clauses – are irrevocable (11.29).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul’s argument finishes with that ringing statement: ‘For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all’ (11.32). It is not simply that Israel has been condemned for the sake of the salvation of the Gentiles. It is not that Paul would need to be condemned for the sake of the salvation of his people. It is rather that God has all along desired to save all, and has simply used condemnation – stumbling, turning away, hardening of heart – as part of the strange means by which to work towards that goal. ‘For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever. Amen.’ (11.36)</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This whole text is complex, and even when one has come up with an interpretation that seems to make sense of it, it is hard not to suspect that one might be missing important parts of what is going on. Nevertheless, it does seem clear that Paul, having started with a picture in which God chooses some and rejects others, ends up with a picture in which even though condemnation and election are the results of God’s prior choices, condemnation is a strategic device, a temporary measure, intended for the sake of salvation – and that includes the salvation of the very people who are for now living under condemnation. Having started with a picture in which God is contented to save some small portion of humankind, and God’s dealings with all are directed solely towards the benefit of that portion, Paul ends up with a renewed affirmation that God desires the salvation of all, and that God’s dealings with any portion of humanity are directed towards the salvation of all.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Yet it is also clear that Paul knows of no form of salvation that is not based on recognizing, believing in, and confessing Jesus of Nazareth. There is no hint here that he moves away from that. For him, that is simply what ‘salvation’ means, and a hope for the salvation of all is a hope that all will be brought to confess Christ. So, what we find in this passage is a commitment to these four ideas:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">God desires to save everyone.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">God’s desires cannot ultimately be outwitted by human actions.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Salvation is found only in Christ.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Not everyone does find salvation in Christ.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Taken at face value, these four ideas seem to be incompatible. 1 and 2 imply that God will save everyone. 1, 2 and 3 therefore imply that everyone will find salvation in Christ. 1, 2 and 3 therefore directly contradict 4. Something has to give.</p>

						<tr>
							<td>
								<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
								<p class="text">Look at those four propositions again. Do you agree that they are incompatible? If one of them has to give, which do you think it should be?</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Paul begins by deleting 1, and supposing that God does not desire the salvation of all – but he ends up rejecting that position by the end of chapter 11. He never questions 3. Some argue that he must not mean 2 absolutely – and that it is possible for people to live in such a way as to snatch condemnation from the jaws of salvation, and to condemn themselves even though God desires to save them. They would say that when Paul says ‘all Israel’, he didn’t mean ‘all’ but, perhaps, ‘a sizeable majority of Israel’ – or, at least, ‘many more Jews than believe in Jesus at the moment’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Some who follow this line think that 2 is the obvious one of the four to give because they have a strong account of free will. God gave human beings free will, and human beings are able to use that free will to pursue aims that God does not desire – and surely it is simply an extension of that to claim that people can use their free will to thwart God’s final desire for their whole lives. God gives people the opportunity to choose salvation or not to choose salvation, but the rest is up to them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Now, as we have already seen, debates over free will are notoriously complex. It is important to realize, however, that the account of free will just described is a good deal more confident, a good deal stronger, than any with which Paul seems to have been operating. Statement 2 would have looked a whole lot less flexible to him, with his very strong theology of God’s sovereignty even over human choices.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Others therefore argue that it is 4 that must give – and that when Paul said ‘all’ he meant ‘all’, every last one – and that therefore one must envisage that even those Jews who have already died without recognizing Christ will somehow be brought by God to recognize Jesus as messiah. Everyone recognizes Christ eventually, even if it takes place after death.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">All of these solutions, however, are attempts to tie down what Paul leaves enigmatic and pregnant with possibilities. They are entirely speculative solutions, and I don’t think that we have any evidence to suggest to us exactly how Paul would have taken further the hints he gives here. I rather suspect that it was not at all clear to him, and that he was willing to leave it in the safe hands of God. Nevertheless, I do think that Paul’s logic pushes towards ‘all’ meaning ‘all’, and that by the end of chapter 11 he has glimpsed a thoroughly universalist vision, even if he does not know how that squares with other things to which he is committed.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">No clear vision</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘We should not, then, be more curious than Scripture allows us to be. With Paul, we may say that grace is far more powerful than sin, that all die in Adam, but that all will also be raised to life in Christ, who will lay a perfected creation at the Father’s feet (Romans 5.12–21; 1 Corinthians 15.21–2, 28). But we must also stand with Christ himself, and with his gospel, at the edge of eternal destruction and gaze down into it. To want to overcome this final antinomy through a premature “synthesis” is not appropriate for theology in this present age.’</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">There are a few more points that I want to make before leaving Romans 9–11 behind. We are not, at this point, discussing what ‘not being saved’ is actually like. That is a separate question, and one that we won’t be considering for now. You can ask ‘Who will be saved?’ and ‘How will they be saved?’ without deciding on questions about the existence and nature of hell. All that matters for our current purposes is the question of whether there can come a point where a person finally ceases to be drawn deeper into the life of God – where a person drops out of the ongoing process of salvation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is also worth noting that the question about whether everyone is saved, or about whether Christ is the only way of salvation, is not a question posed only by modern liberal culture or by political correctness. It is a question that emerges in the Bible itself, and is tussled with there. To think it through, to work hard to understand the question, is not to bow to some anti-Christian agenda, but is to follow in the footsteps of Paul. That doesn’t mean that Paul was any kind of modern pluralist; it doesn’t mean that he thought ‘anything goes’; it doesn’t mean he watered down his commitment to the centrality of Christ. It does mean that he found himself caught between an acknowledgement of God’s desire to save everyone, his belief that Christ was the only means of salvation, and his recognition that not everyone turned to Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As one ponders this question, it is important to pay serious attention to the anguish with which the passage we have been exploring begins. If one claims that it is possible for God to desire someone’s salvation and yet for that person not to be saved, then one must recognize the gravity of what one is saying. One is claiming that God can fail, that God can ultimately be defeated and frustrated by the creation that God has made. One is claiming that human actions can render the life of God, into which God has called all humanity, incomplete. And one is claiming that the rejoicing that Christians picture as the expression of that life must forever be marred by mourning – by anguish like Paul’s – over those who have excluded themselves from this life.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">There is a good deal in the Bible that speaks very firmly of a division between the saved and the unsaved, the elect and the reprobate, and the final condemnation of the latter – including much on Jesus’ own lips. What are we to make of such passages in the light of what I have been saying? Do they pull us decisively away from any universalist answer to Paul’s questions?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">I am going to approach that question obliquely, by telling a story.</p>
				<p class="quotes">A man arrived at the gate of heaven one day, to be met with open arms by Peter. ‘Welcome, brother; welcome to your new home. Your name is one of those written in the book of life, so the gate is open to you.’ Peter showed him through the gate into the green landscape beyond, where he was met by an angel, dispatched to show him around and explain the workings of the place. He was shown where he would live; he was shown how to get in touch with relatives and friends who had died before him. The procedures for booking a chat with any of the more famous inhabitants of heaven were explained – and he asked, rather timidly, to be put down for a meeting with Mozart. He was given his library card, the menu for the nearest eateries, and some information about flying lessons. And then the angel brought him up short with a further comment: ‘Of course, you’ll probably want to visit the Viewing Platform as well.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘The viewing platform?’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘Yes, you know: it’s where you can look down into hell. You must have heard about it – it’s one of heaven’s best-known attractions. Lots of theologians and preachers have talked about it; ask one of the librarians to show you some examples, if you like. You can visit the viewing platform and look into hell, and be filled with joy and amazement at the sure justice of God meted out against sin.’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">The man was taken aback, but so much about this orientation was overwhelming that he said nothing. Yet as soon as he was left alone, he nervously made his way in the direction that the angel had indicated. He climbed a gentle slope, fringed at the top with a plain railing, and when he reached it saw that he was on the rim of a vast crater piercing the green landscape. Though the sun was shining around him, the inside of the crater was as black as night, lit only by fitful glimmers of red fire, and shrouded with smoke and mist. He had been worrying about what he might see, or hear, but at first he could make out nothing. There were not the hordes of writhing sinners that he had worried he might see, and no tortured cries reached him. It seemed empty – vast, dark, terrible and empty.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">He was about to turn away with a smile, believing he had understood, and quite pleased at the joke that had been played on him (if it could be called a joke) when a cry did reach him: a strangled, pain-filled cry from somewhere in the depths of the crater. He peered into the darkness, but could not see from where in the darkness the voice had come. And then he heard it again, and realized with a jolt that he could understand it – that on arriving in heaven all sorts of unlearned knowledge had blossomed in his head. Yes, he could understand it; it was an old, unfamiliar dialect, but it made perfect sense to him. It was Western Aramaic, he knew, of a form spoken two millennia or so ago. A rural accent, for all that he could tell from this pain-filled cry. And it was saying words he knew from something he had read: <span class="italic">Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani</span>. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">There is one person (and one person only) that the Christian tradition has confidently and with near consensus placed in hell: Jesus of Nazareth. The Apostles’ Creed says that Jesus ‘suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. <span class="italic">He descended into hell.</span>’ It was understood by some in the early Church as the extreme point of the exchange or substitution that I talked about on p. 277. Hilary of Poitiers, a fourth-century theologian, wrote ‘Christ, the Son of God, dies; but all flesh is made alive in Christ. The Son of God is in hell; but man is carried back to heaven.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-279" id="footnote-169-279-backlink">279</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Drawing on this tradition, the twentieth-century theologian Karl Barth suggested that if we are asking who is elect and who is reprobate, the answer to both questions is first of all ‘Jesus’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-280" id="footnote-169-280-backlink">280</a></span> He is the elect man, the fulfilment of the covenant with Israel who lived in full communion with the Father – and all election is <span class="italic">in Christ</span>, the election of those who share in his body, and so share in his election, his resurrection life. But, said Barth, Jesus is also the one who suffers the consequences of sin, plumbing the depths of the separation from God that sin creates. He is the rejected one, the condemned one, the one who dies godforsaken and under a curse, and descends to hell. When we think of other men and women being ‘rejected’, we are thinking of them being rejected with Christ, crucified with Christ, dying with him. So, yes, Barth suggests, the Gospel does describe an absolute separation between election and rejection, between good and evil, between the saved and the unsaved – it is the separation between resurrection and crucifixion. Yet, rather than thinking of this separation dividing people into two distinct categories, one of which will end up in heaven, the other in hell, we should think of it as a sword that cuts across all people: all need to die with Christ and all need to rise with Christ – all need to participate in his rejection, to allow the old self to be crucified with him, and all need to participate in his election.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-281" id="footnote-169-281-backlink">281</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The question about universalism then ceases to be a question about whether there is any condemnation, any wrath, any judgement – of course those exist! – but becomes instead the question of whether there are any who are so defined and dominated by the ‘old self’, the self that is to be crucified with Christ, that there will be nothing recognizable left of them to share in his resurrection life. Paul’s argument in Romans 9–11 suggests that the answer is ‘No’, without it being at all clear how that meshes with the other commitments of Christian theology.</p>

				<p class="text-line-below">What, though, of other religions? Where do they fit into the picture that I have been painting? It is popular to suggest that there are three main types of answer to this question. In the first place, there are <span class="italic">exclusivists</span>, who argue that Christianity truly describes salvation and provides access to its source, Jesus Christ, and that other religions, whatever good there may be in them, are not ways of salvation. In the second place, there are <span class="italic">inclusivists</span>, who regard Christianity as true no less than do the exclusivists, but who accept that God is saving many beyond the boundaries of the Christian Church, and may be using other religions to do so. Those other religions may, in the terms I used earlier, be ‘means of grace’, leading people into conformity with the God of Jesus Christ, even if those people do not realize that this is what is happening. In the third place, there are <span class="italic">pluralists</span>, who argue that Christianity might be a true way of describing and providing access to salvation, but not necessarily any <span class="italic">more</span> true than other religions. Christianity, says the pluralist, is one way of grasping a truth that can also be grasped quite differently: the different religions are paths up the same mountain. Some may be wider, easier paths than others, and there may even be some religions that finally keep people from the summit, but Christianity cannot lay claim to be an absolute or privileged account of the nature of God or of salvation.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-282" id="footnote-169-282-backlink">282</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The theology that I have been exploring so far in this book does not sit neatly in a single one of these categories. In the first place, it has something of the flavour of ‘exclusivism’ about it: I explained the doctrine of the Trinity as involving the claim that ‘God is the one whom Christians know as they find themselves, in the Spirit, caught up in the Son’s love of the Father and the Father’s sending of the Son.’ And when discussing the doctrine of the Spirit, I said that ‘God is Christ-shaped’ and that ‘To get into this space, you must become Christ-shaped; if you take on a different shape, you arrive somewhere else.’ And when discussing Paul’s argument in Romans 9–11 above, I suggested that one of his axioms is that salvation is found only in Jesus Christ. Knowledge of Christ, or relation to Christ, is essential in the theology I have been expounding – and, as I have repeatedly explained, ‘Christ’ does not name a general principle or idea, but a person, so it is attention specifically to Jesus of Nazareth that is essential.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">However, some of my discussions have pointed in a more inclusivist direction. I suggested in the chapter on the Spirit that <span class="italic">wherever</span> Christlike life, Christlike love, is emerging in the world, that is the work of the Spirit conforming people to Christ – and it seems obvious that Christlike life and love emerge in all sorts of places, well beyond the boundaries of the Church, or the spread of explicit knowledge of and response to the gospel. The univeralism to which I pointed earlier in this chapter suggests the same thing – that we should not divide the world up into Christians, who will be saved, and non-Christians, who will not, but should see that the judgement and salvation that Christ brings apply to all people, and that they rest upon an acceptance that God offers to all. To put it another way, the human being Jesus of Nazareth may be the only criterion by which Christians can judge, and he may be an unsubstitutably particular human being rather than an idea or a principle, but that does not mean that condemnation is the only judgement that he will offer of life that has grown up independently of devout attention to him.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This ‘inclusivist’ strand in what I have been saying does, of course, still claim a privilege for the Christian tradition: it still assumes that it is Jesus who is the criterion for judgement and salvation. It is important to notice, however, that most forms of pluralism claim no less a privilege. If one claims that all religions are really paths up the same mountain, even if one claims that one has no direct way of characterizing that mountain except by the language one happens to have learnt in one’s own tradition, one is still making the very strong claim that those aspects of all religions that directly oppose or deny or rule out other religions must be secondary or mistaken, and that in outline one knows the secret of the salvation to which those religious traditions point better than do those adherents who cling to exclusivist or inclusivist accounts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Nevertheless, the kind of theology I have been presenting does include something like a pluralist moment. I have talked a great deal about the ungraspability of God, and about Christian’s ignorance about <span class="italic">how</span> the claims that they believe they are required to make about God are actually true of God. And I have talked a great deal about openness to discovering that one is wrong, or that one needs to expand or reform one’s thinking – and about how the different ways of thinking and acting that Christians find in those around them who differ from them might turn out to be <span class="italic">gifts</span>, helping drive that process of expansion or reform.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">As a convinced Trinitarian Christian, I believe that the Word and the Spirit have truly been sent by God, and truly draw me into the life of God, and that God truly is immanently as God is in this economy – so that God really <span class="italic">is</span> Christlike, and Christ really <span class="italic">is</span> God’s way of saving the world. But I can also say that I <span class="italic">simply do not know how </span>this fits in with other claims to know God, or to know the meaning and means of salvation. I believe that I am, say, sent into conversation with my Jewish and Muslim friends with the vocation to witness to Christ – and that I don’t go into that conversation regarding this as a negotiable point or a temporary working hypothesis: I go in believing it to be <span class="italic">true</span>. But I also believe I go in called to listen to my friends and to hear from them things I could not have said to myself, which might cause me to understand my own vocation and witness differently: I go in hoping and expecting to learn something new of Christ, and so of God, in encounter with them. And it may be (though I cannot possibly legislate for this) that they approach the conversation with some analogous conviction: a desire to witness to the revelation of God in Torah or in the Quran, but a willingness to be shown the Torah or the Quran afresh in conversation with me and with each other. Each of us, as it were, might approach the conversation as a different species of inclusivist. It accords with the structure of the theology I have been expounding to say that I do not know where all this will end. I do not know whether I will simply be left with this inclusivism. I do not know whether in some unguessed future we might discover that our inclusivisms converge, and that my Trinitarianism has become thoroughly flavoured by the Torah and the Quran, just as my conversation partners find that their vocations have become thoroughly flavoured by the gospel. I do not know whether we will find that there are aspects, perhaps even central aspects, of our respective vocations that will turn out to be incompatible, so that as a Christian I will only see my Muslim or Jewish friends being drawn into the life of God via the loss or overturning of something they hold dear – or whether I might find that I am led to the abandonment of something that I hold dear, even something that I presently regard as non-negotiable. And I do not know whether it may turn out that the ends that each of us longs for and pursues may simply turn out to be different, too different even to be mutually exclusive (as different as being tall is from liking cheese, rather than as different as being tall is from being short).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-283" id="footnote-169-283-backlink">283</a></span> I have hunches, of course, and I can see all sorts of things in our practices and beliefs that look compatible or analogous, and all sorts of things that I cannot imagine leading to anything but serious disagreement, including quite central things. And if I include Buddhism, Hinduism and other religious traditions in the conversation, the variety increases even more noticeably. But standing where I stand, I do not know what end God has in store for this conversation, and nothing in my theology tells me that I <span class="italic">ought</span> to know. All that I have is the vocation to enter the conversation seriously, to do so as part of my journey deeper into the triune economy of God, and to do so as a witness to the life of God that I believe has been opened to me in Christ and the Spirit.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The questions posed by the plurality of religions are even deeper – and discussed in a very broad swathe of theological literature. One debate that is worth following is that between John Hick and Gavin D’Costa on whether the ‘pluralist’ position is any less exclusive than the alternatives. See John Hick, <span class="italic">God and the Universe of Faiths </span>(Oxford: Oneworld, 1993), pp. 133–47; Gavin D’Costa, <span class="italic">The Meeting of Religions and the Trinity </span>(Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 2000), pp. 19–52; John Hick ‘The Possibility of Religious Pluralism: A Reply to Gavin D’Costa’, <span class="italic">Religious Studies </span>33 (1997), pp. 161–6; Gavin D’Costa, ‘Christ, the Trinity and Religious Plurality’ in D’Costa (ed.), <span class="italic">Christian Uniqueness Reconsidered </span>(Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 2002), pp. 16–29.

				<p class="text-line-above">My own response to the plurality of religions has been much influenced by my involvement in the ‘Scriptural Reasoning’ movement – a joint initiative of Jewish, Christian and Islamic scholars focused on the shared reading of scriptural texts.
