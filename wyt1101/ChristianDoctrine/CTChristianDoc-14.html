				<p class="text">Once again, I continue to ask what it means for Christians to see the world in which they live as a world caught up in the threefold economy of salvation, being drawn into participation in God’s life. This chapter completes an arc that began in Chapter 7. To that chapter’s discussion of creation, and Chapter 8’s discussion of providence, I now add a discussion of ‘eschatology’: God’s bringing of creation to its appointed end, the completion or fulfilment of the work of creation.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">In the whole of this book so far, and especially in Chapter 8, the idea that God has an end for the world, or that the world has its future in God, has been a recurring motif. The world was created, Christian theologians have said, for life in God, and God is drawing all things towards that life by means of the threefold economy. In other words, everything I have said so far has had an <span class="italic">eschatological</span> cast – where ‘eschatology’ is the doctrine of ‘the last things’ (the <span class="italic">eschata</span>, in Greek) or ‘the end time’ (the <span class="italic">eschaton</span>).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christians live in a world that has a <span class="italic">horizon</span> to it, a horizon towards which they see the world heading. Wherever or whenever Christians find themselves, whatever present arrangement they inhabit, their faith interrupts them and prompts them to gaze ahead, and glimpse something of the country towards which they are journeying. This horizon lies beyond any present view Christians have of the world, and colours all their responses to it. Each situation, each event, each reality can be seen as happening against the backdrop provided by God’s future, and is in part <span class="italic">defined </span>by its relationship to that future. The world is not simply ‘one damn thing after another’, for Christians; it is a world on its way to God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-191" id="footnote-169-191-backlink">191</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christians have differed, however, in how they have understood the connection between their present environs and this looming horizon. On the one hand, Christians have sometimes thought about this horizon as a future towards which God is working steadily in the present. That is, they have understood God to be steering the world incrementally in the direction of the end, accumulating now all the resources that will eventually be spent to establish the kingdom. On the other hand, Christians have sometimes thought about this horizon as a future for which they can only wait: an end that will come ‘like a thief in the night’ (1 Thessalonians 5.2) decisively and suddenly setting to rights a broken world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the whole the emphasis in Christian theology has fallen on the latter way of thinking. However much the world might be oriented towards God’s future, however much there may be by God’s providence signs, tendencies and movements in the present that hint at it and point towards it, however much the world might be made for this end and bear the signs of that making, that future will eventually arrive as a reversal to the world’s flight from God – a challenge to and a transformation of all the present ways of the world. As such, the future horizon remains beyond any future that human beings can now project on the basis of the current state and direction of the world. Christian hope is a form of trust, not a form of optimism; it waits upon God’s faithfulness to God’s promises, rather than cheerfully estimating the likely outcome of present tendencies.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">All this means that one must be very careful to distinguish the hope for God’s future that Christians profess from something that sounds superficially similar. This Christian orientation towards the future is not about <span class="italic">progress</span>; it is not a matter of the world slowly accumulating godly practices and understanding, growing generation by generation away from violence, ignorance and confusion towards the sunny uplands of the future.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-192" id="footnote-169-192-backlink">192</a></span> It is not a matter of processes and mechanisms that one can explain and predict. In fact, when Christians have tried to give descriptions of how the world might go between now and the end, they have tended to say that it may well get worse and worse, until God steps in to set it all to rights.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-193" id="footnote-169-193-backlink">193</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Yet the other branch of Christian eschatological conviction has been important too: the conviction that even though God’s future will come as a gift, it is a gift that Christians are already receiving, in provisional, partial forms.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-194" id="footnote-169-194-backlink">194</a></span> Or (to put the same thing the other way around) Christians wait upon a gift that will not require them to empty their cupboards once they receive it, but will itself be capacious enough to gather up and hold all that God is doing in their midst in the present. After all, the gift for which Christians wait, the future for which they hope, is God’s own capacious life – life that is not absent from the world in the present.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Resurrection</span></p>
				<p class="text">Jesus’ resurrection has provided a primary model for Christian eschatological thinking. Although the very fact that Christian theology speaks in terms of ‘bodily’ resurrection means that Christians have placed a good deal of emphasis on the <span class="italic">continuity</span> between Jesus’ pre-resurrection life and the life which comes after the resurrection, the fact that they also take seriously Christ’s death means that there is a strong element of discontinuity as well. The resurrection is not seen as the natural continuance of Jesus’ life, or its evolution to a higher level. Jesus is raised by God, as a gift from God, and what God gives in the resurrection is a <span class="italic">transformative</span> continuation (a fulfilment, a perfection) of who Jesus was. The resurrection is God’s gift: a gift of the future life of the world now.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-195" id="footnote-169-195-backlink">195</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Christian authors have sometimes spoken of three comings or advents of Jesus. There was the first advent, when he was born as a baby in first-century Palestine. That advent was the coming of God’s life into the present: a portion of creaturely life was caught up and shaped so as to be utterly transparent to God. That first advent was the establishment of an outpost in the present of the future that God has for the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is also an ‘intermediate advent’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-196" id="footnote-169-196-backlink">196</a></span> By the power of the Spirit, Christ’s life is made present in the world in the lives of his disciples. Their Christ-formed lives become signs and foretastes of the future, of which the Spirit is their ‘pledge’ or ‘deposit’ (Ephesians 1.14). The future of the body of Christ pledged by the Spirit is a future in which each person becomes a gift to the whole body, and in which each person becomes the recipient of the gifts that each other member is, receiving more of Christ from them. As the seventh-century Byzantine theologian Maximus the Confessor puts it, ‘each of us will bring to completion that Body that itself brings all things to completion in each of us, filling everything and itself brought to fullness by all things’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-197" id="footnote-169-197-backlink">197</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">To shift the metaphor somewhat, one could think of each person as a text about Christ that at present is garbled and corrupted, and can only be read in snatches and with caution, but which in the eschaton will be edited into full legibility. And just as Christ is known more fully in the commentary upon him provided by the life of each one of his followers, so one might think of each person in the eschaton not simply as a text that says one thing about Christ – a simple propositional statement about him, say – but as a poem that each member of the body will read and understand differently.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This intermediate advent never ends. Rather than thinking of the eschaton as the <span class="italic">end </span>of giving and receiving (because all will have been given, all received) one can think of it instead as the transition to unrestricted giving and receiving – the continual and unlimited arrival of Christ. Wherever Christians receive Christ in the present, and so experience little advents, they can think of them both as the coming to them of more of the Christ of the first advent, and as the breaking through into the present of anticipations of this future life of unrestricted advent.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-198" id="footnote-169-198-backlink">198</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">As well as speaking about this ongoing ‘intermediate advent’, however, Christians have also spoken of a <span class="italic">final </span>advent of Christ. In the words of the Nicene Creed, ‘He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-199" id="footnote-169-199-backlink">199</a></span> That is, as well as imagining their journey towards the end as a journey on which they become Christlike, a journey on which <span class="italic">his</span> life becomes visible in <span class="italic">theirs</span>, Christians have also imagined the fulfilment of that journey not simply as <span class="italic">their arrival</span> at Christlikeness, but as <span class="italic">Christ’s return</span>. Christians have traditionally hoped for Christ’s return in glory to gather to himself all those in whom his life has taken root.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The fulfilled life to which the Spirit draws the body of Christ only reaches fulfilment when it is brought into circulation around the living presence of the one who is its referent. The body of Christ is also the Bride of Christ, and the final advent has been thought of as the wedding of this Bride to Christ, the intimate union between all the images and reflections of Jesus that are found in Christian life and their original.</p>
				<p class="quotes">They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever. (Revelation 22.4–5)</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">After all, if it is by journeying into the threefold economy that human beings participate in the life of God, then the only apt way of imagining the consummation of that economy is as unrestricted, unstinting fellowship with Jesus, in the power of the Spirit, in the presence of the Father. Without knowing quite what it is that their imagination refers to, therefore, the Trinitarian logic of Christian theology compels Christians to imagine the end to which God is drawing them as an end in which Jesus is wholly present and alive to them – a future in which Jesus has ‘come again’. It is no accident that one of the oldest Christian prayers known to us is <span class="italic">Maranatha!</span>, which means, <span class="italic">Come, O Lord!</span> (1 Corinthians 16.22 – cf. Revelation 22.20).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The primary question for Christian eschatology is not ‘When?’, nor ‘How?’, nor even ‘In what form?’ The primary question is ‘Who?’ And the answer that Christians have given is simply that it is Christ, the visibility of God’s life, who stands at the end. Christ is the eschatological horizon: the direction and movement that the world has when seen against that horizon is a direction and movement towards him.</p>

				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">If you should find yourself in a church service any time soon, spend some time carefully watching and listening – and ask yourself whether any eschatological expectation, hope or desire is expressed anywhere in the service.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-200" id="footnote-169-200-backlink">200</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">‘Without knowing quite what it is that their imagination refers to’, though. One should be wary of any attempt to tie down precisely material that in the biblical witness and in Christian reflection is only confusingly and variously set out. As the American theologian Hans Frei said,</p>
				<p class="quotes">Either to affirm that it is simply Jesus Christ as he was in past history, or to affirm that it is simply God manifest in Jesus rather than Jesus Christ himself, who will stand at the latter end, is an unwarranted short-cut of the New Testament’s complexity and therefore an illegitimate dissolution of its mysteriousness.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-201" id="footnote-169-201-backlink">201</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">What the final advent will be, and how it will sum up and fulfil the first advent and the intermediate advent, is not something that Christians know, or need to know.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Three advents</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘We know that there are three comings of the Lord. The third lies between the other two. It is invisible, while the other two are visible. In the first coming he was seen on earth, dwelling among men; he himself testifies that they saw him and hated him (John 15.24). In the final coming all flesh will see the salvation of our God (Luke 3.6), and they will look on him whom they pierced (Zechariah 12.10 and John 19.37). The intermediate coming is a hidden one; in it only the elect see the Lord within their own selves, and they are saved. In his first coming our Lord came in our flesh and in our weakness; in this middle coming he comes in spirit and in power; in the final coming he will be seen in glory and majesty. …</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Because this coming lies between the other two, it is like a road on which we travel from the first coming to the last. In the first, Christ was our redemption; in the last, he will appear as our life; in this middle coming, he is our rest and consolation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘In case someone should think that what we say about this middle coming is sheer invention, listen to what our Lord himself ways: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him” (John 19.23).’</p>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-15-3"><span class="bold">Setting the world to rights</span></p>
				<p class="text">Visions of the great and terrible ‘Day of the Lord’, on which God will come to exercise judgement on the earth, punctuate the prophetic texts of the Old Testament (for example, Isaiah 13.6; Ezekiel 30.3; Joel 2.1 and so on) and are re-echoed in the New (1 Thessalonians 5.2; 2 Peter 3.10). It is not so much an end of time that is envisaged, as an end to the present order of things – an end to the time when distortion and destruction cloud the face of creation, when the wicked flourish and the righteous perish.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-203" id="footnote-169-203-backlink">203</a></span> The biblical authors see on the horizon God’s invincible establishment of the divine reign on earth, a gift and a judgement that will come like a thief in the night, but reign like a king forever.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Most Christian theologians have taken this kind of vision to refer to an event that will take place on some future date in history: there will one day be a reckoning, a final setting to rights of the world. This final event was anticipated in the first coming of Christ, who inaugurated the kingdom of God in the midst of a dark and distorted world; it is anticipated in the intermediate coming of Christ, in the lives of those in whom the Spirit works; but this work awaits completion on the Day of the Lord, when Christ will return to the earth in glory.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-204" id="footnote-169-204-backlink">204</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Some other theologians have thought instead that the ‘judgement’ spoken of is that which, by Christ and the Spirit, comes to each person in her own time and place, rather than being an event that will take place at some one point in history. They hold that imagining an approaching literal end to the present order of things is a way of dramatizing the sense that each individual, each society, faces the unavoidable Christ-shaped judgement of God. The horizon is and will remain just that: the limit at the edge of what one can now see. Just like tomorrow, the horizon never comes.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-205" id="footnote-169-205-backlink">205</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Still others are content to leave their answer to these questions ambiguous – to talk about and hope for the coming of the end, without knowing quite what their talk refers to. Nevertheless, whichever different ways all these theologians jump, they have a common commitment to the idea that Christianity’s eschatological vision is a vision that places all present life, corporate and individual, under the impending judgement of God. This vision provides a horizon that decisively reshapes Christians’ view of life in the present.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">For some, such a vision has been a passport to quietism – that is, to the idea that because God will sort all things out in the end the believer’s job is simply to watch and pray, waiting patiently for the end. There is no point in their agitating for change now, for none of their activities can bring the kingdom one inch nearer.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">For others, however, a Christian eschatological imagination has led them in quite the opposite direction. Many of the most radical movements for change in Christian history have also been the most radical in the strength of their eschatological commitments. It seems to have been the case that a strong eschatological imagination regularly consorts with deep <span class="italic">restlessness</span> with the current state of the world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-206" id="footnote-169-206-backlink">206</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the one hand, because current realities are seen against the horizon of God’s future, they are themselves seen not to be final, not to be ultimate, not to be inevitable, not to be unquestionable. Whatever shape the world is in right now, the eschatological imagination says that <span class="italic">there is more than this</span> – and that this present reality stands under the judgement of the reality to come.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, the eschatological vision also provides a glimpse of a different ordering of the world. It may only be a vision ‘through a glass darkly’,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-207" id="footnote-169-207-backlink">207</a></span> and it may be a vision of an order that human beings could not possibly bring about by themselves, but it can be a light sufficient to show believers that some aspects of their world’s current order witness to God’s future, making room for it – and that other aspects deny that future and shut the doors to it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This combination is a recipe for social and political action: a belief that the shape of the world is not absolutely fixed, coupled with some glimpse of what the shape of the world <span class="italic">should </span>be.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Reconciliation</span></p>
				<p class="text">Imagine a society split into two feuding groups, each with its own distinct culture. Imagine this society blighted by the hatred and violence between these two groups. The Christian eschatological vision might, quite simply, be of both groups living harmoniously together, of each group having the best things about its culture fulfilled and completed, and of the differences between them becoming a matter of celebration rather than of exclusion, each contributing something distinctive to their common life. In the current state of things, this vision may sound like ‘pie in the sky’ – a ridiculously naive and fluffy picture with no relationship to reality. It may even be impossible to see how groups so different could ever coexist peacefully (let alone celebrate their diversity) without one or other of them having to be defeated and assimilated by the other. And because the vision Christians have is of a future that <span class="italic">God</span> has for the world, rather than of a future that they can directly bring about, Christians will not necessarily have any access to a straightforward and clear Christian political programme that would only need to be implemented for the problems of this divided society to fall away.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet holding on to their eschatological vision, however dimly grasped it is, however hard to imagine concretely, may mean that Christians oppose any moves that simply <span class="italic">assume </span>that there could be no common future for these two groups, or no way forward without one side being defeated. And this vision, however dimly grasped, may mean that Christians support and get involved in those plans – however risky they might seem – that try to keep open at least the <span class="italic">possibility </span>of reconciliation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In fact, it is quite important that Christians on either side do <span class="italic">not</span> begin with the assumption that they know clearly in advance the shape that reconciled life will take in the future, if the process of reconciliation is not to take the form of them squeezing the other group into their own vision. It is in the process of getting involved, in the process of working for peace, in the process of holding on to and working with those faint signs and promises of the future that they can detect in the mire of the present, that Christians will discover a fuller content for their eschatological vision.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-208" id="footnote-169-208-backlink">208</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The kind of political engagement that goes with eschatological vision is best thought of as exploratory – not out of any desire to keep everything vague and unobjectionable, but because what Christians believe the future holds is the life of God, which is always greater than any of their limited imaginings of it. Christians glimpse a vision of the future, and that vision enables them to give a critique of the present and to work to change it. But it <span class="italic">is </span>only a glimpse of the future that they get, and as they explore further, as they actually involve themselves in shaping the present, their vision itself gets changed and deepened. Their journey of action in the world in the present is at the same time a journey of exploration deeper into the eschatological vision that drives them – and they will find that their ideas and practices are challenged and remade in the process.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-209" id="footnote-169-209-backlink">209</a></span> As yet, they see that future only ‘through a glass darkly’, and their attempt to live towards it is bound to be tentative and fallible, carried out not in confidence that the future is within their grasp and that they are capable of constructing it, but that they are within <span class="italic">its </span>grasp, and may trust themselves to it.</p>

				<p class="text-line-below">The exploratory political engagement to which the Christian eschatological vision lends itself is of necessity a matter of learning discernment. Consider the following two texts:</p>
				<p class="quotes">1Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God. 2Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgement. 3For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you wish to have no fear of the authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive its approval; 4for it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for the authority does not bear the sword in vain! It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer. 5Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience. 6For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, busy with this very thing. 7Pay to all what is due them – taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honour to whom honour is due.</p>

				<p class="quotes">5The beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. 6It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.  7Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. It was given authority over every tribe and people and language and nation, 8and all the inhabitants of the earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slaughtered. 9Let anyone who has an ear listen: 10If you are to be taken captive, into captivity you go; if you kill with the sword, with the sword you must be killed. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In both these passages, the authority of worldly rulers is presented as given by God – but that is where the similarity stops. In Romans 13, authority is given to worldly rulers by God, and those rulers are represented as God’s servants: they carry out God’s will; they punish the evil and reward the good. Here, worldly authority is fundamentally godly, and to resist worldly rulers is to resist God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-210" id="footnote-169-210-backlink">210</a></span> In Revelation<span class="italic"> </span>13, however, authority is given to a worldly ruler by God – but now only in the sense that God in God’s patience <span class="italic">allows</span> that ruler authority for a time. The ruler is presented as God’s enemy: one who blasphemes against God, who is adored by the evil and punishes the good. Here, worldly authority is fundamentally demonic, and to resist this ruler is to show faithful endurance.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-211" id="footnote-169-211-backlink">211</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">The tension with which I began (between God’s future as a kingdom being built already in the present and God’s future as a sudden transformation ready to break in on a godless world) is played out again between these two passages. On the one hand there is a vision of the present political order as a preparation for and servant of God’s future, holding open space in the present for godly life that anticipates that future. On the other there is a vision of the present political order as a denial of God’s future, inimical to godly life – the final sclerotic hardening of hearts before God breaks in. In the former, witness to and anticipation of God’s future is found not just among the coterie of believers, but (at least in part) in the large-scale social and political order of their world. In the latter, this witness is found among martyrs, flickers of protest and resistance who witness not by building something secure and lasting, a solid and visible foretaste of the kingdom, but by refusing to make calculations of efficacy and practicality, and allowing themselves to be conquered rather than worshipping the beast.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That Christianity can give rise to both Romans 13 and Revelation 13 – and to the broader tensions in eschatological thinking that they represent – calls into question any easy answer, whether it be wholesale affirmation of the present social order, or wholesale rejection. It questions grand gestures of either acceptance or denial, and instead calls believers to <span class="italic">discernment</span>: to careful attention to the present against the backdrop of the future. There is no substitute for looking, interpreting, assessing and risking fallible political judgements, no shortcut to purity and moral safety. Christians can only look at the world and ask where it is open to God’s future and where closed – and then look again, and again, and again.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A Christian might ask, for instance whether the political regime under which she lives allows that differences between individuals and groups could be not insuperable problems but <span class="italic">gifts</span>, contributions to a common good that no group can imagine or construct on its own. That kind of eschatological vision obviously stands against various forms of exclusion, in which difference is simply understood as deviance or failure. It also obviously stands against various forms of violence in which one individual or group would seek to deny another a voice, or would seek wholly to define what the other may and may not say. It also stands, however, against the kind of laissez-faire<span class="italic"> </span>tolerance that lets different groups flourish in their own enclaves, and provides no spaces within which the mutual interaction and cross-fertilization of those groups becomes possible. This kind of eschatological vision might push her towards seeing society as an ongoing conversation, not simply a collection of individual voices.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-212" id="footnote-169-212-backlink">212</a></span> Where in the present can she see such conversation emerging? What are the forces that undermine it? What may she affirm, and what must she deny?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">By such questions, eschatological thinking tips believers into politics, forcing them to take responsibility for the present shape of their world.</p>

					<li class="bullet-list">The application of eschatological imagination to present social and political realities requires discernment.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Eschatological imagination provides important questions to ask of present social and political realities, rather than easy answers.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-15-7"><span class="bold">The four last things</span></p>
				<p class="text">In many traditional discussions, eschatology is broken down into four topics – the ‘four last things’, death, judgement, heaven and hell.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-213" id="footnote-169-213-backlink">213</a></span> The focus in such discussions tends to be on eschatology as it affects the individual, rather than the more corporate vision that I have just been discussing.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Death</span></p>
				<p class="text">Death can be thought of in several different ways in relation to eschatology. First, the fact that I will die means that I am not granted unlimited time, and so not granted unlimited opportunity to mould my impact on the world, or unlimited chances to reshape who I am. My acts now have weight. In this sense, I already experience something of this dying during my lifetime: the death of others, and the metaphorical death of relationships, the movement of people beyond the places and times in which I can interact with them, reinforces the sense that I only get one go at life, and can’t waste what opportunities I am given. Words spoken in haste cannot be taken back, lost friends cannot be confessed to. Death can be seen simply as finitude writ large: it is a final turn of the screw on one aspect of what it is to be a creature.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Second, the fact that I will die, and die before very long at that, means that the eschatological horizon is not, for me personally, a distant vista that simply decorates the far, far limits of my vision. In combination with the other ‘last things’, the fact of death has been taken in Christian theology to mean that the future that God has for the world is a future that stands close to each one of us. Life is short, and then the end comes.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Third, however, death is seen in Christianity as a path that has been taken before us, and therefore as a path that can be followed without fear, because someone familiar is waiting for us. And that brings us to the second of the ‘four last things’.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Judgement</span></p>
				<p class="text">Christians have traditionally claimed that the beginning of the future that God has for the world can be pictured as an act of divine judgement. I have explained already in my discussion of Psalm 139 the idea that, however obscure and confused the world seems to us, Christians believe that the truth of things is clear to God. God is the one who sees all distortions, delusions and dishonesty for what they are, and who recognizes and traces back all the distorted scripts that we follow in our supposed freedom. But God is also the one who sees what this obscure and confused mess can become, how it already contains hints and suggestions of the future that God has for the world. In the language of earlier chapters, God sees what it is about each person, each community, that could become a unique contribution to the life of the body of Christ. Christians have imagined God’s judgement as just such a two-fold making clear: the exposure of all that distorts and betrays the life that God has for the world, and the uncovering and drawing out of all that, however partially, already hints at it or embodies it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">When I said, a moment ago, that ‘My acts now have weight’, this expected judgement was the context: I will soon die and (so Christians have traditionally claimed) face this twofold judgement upon all that I am, all that I have, all that I have done. The horizon towards which I am oriented in the present is a horizon of judgement – the combined promise and threat that all things will be made clear: all victims remembered, all unsung heroes sung, all things done in darkness brought to light, all pretence blown away.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is important, however, not to get the tenor of this claim wrong. It can be easy to forget that the judge in question is the God of Jesus Christ, the God who is love, and that this judgement is traditionally pictured as judgement at the hands of Jesus himself. The source and context for this judgement is therefore God’s unfailing, invincible, unfathomable love for the one judged. The condemnation of all in a person that resists or denies Christ is seen not as the bringing of that person up against a purely external standard, but a freeing of that person to be truly himself or herself: the freeing of that person to become the gift that he or she is. ‘Judgement’, in this view, is nothing other than a final welcome into the life of God, which is a welcome <span class="italic">home</span>. To put it another way, if a horizon of eschatological judgement looms over my world, it is not the surveillance of some impersonal thought-police, checking my conduct against an abstract rulebook; it is a horizon beyond which stands my true self, which is my self in Christ.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Hell</span></p>
				<p class="text">This is the name that Christians have given to the future that God has for all that distorts and betrays God’s life. Traditionally, hell has been seen as a place of eternal punishment, of torment for those who have set themselves deliberately against the life of God. It is perhaps becoming more common now for it to be seen as a matter of annihilation or destruction – the end of all that contradicts and distorts the life of creation, necessary if that creation is to be fulfilled. <span class="italic">If </span>this is all that one means by ‘hell’ (and I don’t claim to have established that it should be) then it is simply a consequence of what I have said about heaven. To speak of creation freed from all that constricts and distorts it is to think of creation with the constrictions and distortions identified, exposed and consigned to destruction: it is to think of those constrictions and distortions judged and consigned to the wastebasket. Some such destruction is an inherent part of the picture I have been painting, and any Christian hope for the future of what is true, real and free in their own lives and the life of the world around them automatically brings with it a desire for the stripping away of all that is false, fake and constricting.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-214" id="footnote-169-214-backlink">214</a></span></p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Heaven</span></p>
				<p class="text">This is the name that Christians have given to the fulfilment or completion of all that now points to or participates in God’s life – all, as it were, that meets with the positive judgement of God. The kingdom of heaven is the realm of creation freed fully and finally to be itself, and so to share without impediment in the life of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">It should not, if it is to be consonant with the kind of theology we have been exploring, be thought of as involving being whisked off to another world: it is the fulfilment of <span class="italic">this</span> world. It should not be thought of as the abandonment of creatureliness: it is the fulfilment <span class="italic">of </span>creaturely life. It should not be thought of as the end of bodily life: it is the fulfilment <span class="italic">of </span>bodily life. It is that end for which God created the world.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Souls and bodies</span></p>
				<p class="text">Traditional Christian theology evolved quite an elaborate scheme for talking about the eschatological place of bodies. It was claimed that, on death, the disembodied soul went immediately to the place that God’s judgement assigned to it, but that this soul had only a partial existence; only with the resurrection of the body and the reuniting of body and soul would judgement be complete, and the full experience of salvation or damnation be possible.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-215" id="footnote-169-215-backlink">215</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Although this scheme both seems to be overly speculative, and to rely upon a metaphysics of body and soul that many will find off-putting, it does point to two aspects of Christian hope. That hope is for a resurrection of each person to full, bodily life – the only life that can be imagined for creatures like us. And yet that hope is not dented or distracted by the dissolution of bodies in the grave (or the crematorium). Christians who hold to a belief in bodily resurrection have to believe that in some sense the strings of their bodily identity are held by God until they are reconstituted at the resurrection. If one is prepared to give the name ‘soul’ to what I have just called ‘the strings of … bodily identity’, then this is not that far from the traditional picture.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-216" id="footnote-169-216-backlink">216</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Many ways of picturing or imagining heaven are deeply off-putting, and one of the main reasons for this is their tendency to deny the creatureliness of the citizens of this kingdom: denying that they are finite, that they are temporal, and so on. Some of the richer imaginings of heaven in the Christian tradition, however, celebrate this – and see heaven not as a static and all-but-disembodied state, but as a journey together ever deeper into the still-ungraspable reality of God, albeit a journey not cumbered with the constrictions and distortions that now hold it back.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Nevertheless, inadequate though it may be, imagination is all that believers have. Christians believe they have been shown something of what is true, real and free in their own lives and the life of the world around them. They believe that they have been shown that those things do have a future. But all Christian imaginings of heaven are simply an attempt to place those dimly grasped hints and suggestions into a story or a picture of their own invention, which they can grasp, but which cannot do more than gesture in the direction of the unimaginable fulfilment of Christian hope. They are like attempts to draw a map of a far country based simply on the glimpses one has of its peaks on the distant horizon of one’s own land. And what they dramatize, above all, is the sense pervasive in Christianity that believers’ lives, and the life of the whole world, have to do with God – that God not only upholds them but sees them, guides them, judges them, and has a future for them. All in life that participates in the Christlike life of God, all that witnesses to Christ, has a future; everything else – all that constricts and distorts and drags down that life – does not. And it is to those distorting, constricting realities, and to their lack of future, that we now turn: to evil (Chapter 10) and to sin (Chapter 11).</p>

Perhaps you will get some idea of it if you think like this. You may have been in a room in which there was a window that looked out on a lovely bay of the sea or a green valley that wound away among mountains. And in the wall of that room opposite to the window there may have been a looking-glass. And as you turned away from the window you suddenly caught sight of that sea or that valley, all over again, in the looking glass. And the sea in the mirror, or the valley in the mirror, were in one sense just the same as the real ones: yet at the same time they were somehow different – deeper, more wonderful, more like places in a story: in a story you have never heard but very much want to know. The difference between the old Narnia and the new Narnia was like that. The new one was a deeper country: every rock and flower and blade of grass looked as if it meant more. I can’t describe it any better than that: if you ever get there you will know what I mean.’</p>

Such pictures, of course, will vary indefinitely: they may take their key from moments of rest, of activity, of thought, of contemplation; but always we shall be constructing for ourselves our own heaven. … And so long as we are – no doubt unconsciously – prescribing to God the kind of heaven he must provide for us if we are to welcome the prospect of it, we are betraying our unfitness for the only possible heaven, which is a life of which God and not ourselves will be the centre.’</p>

Rather, the Day of Yahweh was a powerful concept available to the prophets for their use in interpreting various momentous events – past, future or imminent’, even though ‘In the late post-exilic era the portrayals of the Day of Yahweh tend to become more and more cataclysmic and universal in character under the influence of apocalyptic thought’ (pp. 335–6)</p>
