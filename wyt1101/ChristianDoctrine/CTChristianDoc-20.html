				<p class="text">Christians can make sense of themselves, their communities and their world as being drawn into the life of God. That has been my claim throughout this book. But where does this sense come from? What are its sources? What authorizes this particular way of telling the Christian story? The answer suggested in Chapter 14 was that it is the witness of the apostles that provides theology’s foundation – the witness that is found (largely or exclusively<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-345" id="footnote-169-345-backlink">345</a></span>) in the pages of the Bible. So what role should the Bible play in theology – and, more broadly, in the kind of Christian life I have described in this book? The simplest answer, but one that fits quite well with the themes of this book, might be: ‘Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-346" id="footnote-169-346-backlink">346</a></span> That is, the Bible might be seen as the means (or <span class="italic">a</span> means) by which the love of God in Christ is communicated. That simple answer, however, conceals a clutch of complexities, which I will be exploring in this chapter and the next.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">In this chapter, I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">ask where Christians’ knowledge of Jesus comes from;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">ask what role the Bible plays in forming this knowledge;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">point out that Christians have had rather different ideas about what the Bible teaches about Jesus, and about <span class="italic">how </span>it teaches;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">introduce the term ‘biblical settlement’ to refer to the most resilient of these ideas; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">claim that there is no easy way to choose between such settlements.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-line-above">In the next chapter, which forms a pair with this one, I will go on to suggest a ‘biblical settlement’ that coheres with the Trinitarian theology explored so far in this book.</p>

					<li class="bullet-list">What is the Bible? What is it for? How does it differ from other books? How should Christians treat it? What can it tell them? Jot down now some brief notes on any answers you have to these sorts of questions. And give some time to thinking about whether you have found the kind of uses I’ve made of the Bible in this book reasonable, legitimate, and convincing. If not, what has been wrong with them?</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">If you type ‘doctrine of scripture’ into an internet search engine like Google, you will find a whole clutch of theological claims about the nature and importance of the Bible. Skim through a few of these now to get a sense of the kind of claims that people make about the Bible. Are there any of these sites that you feel more comfortable with – that seem to you to be heading in the right sort of direction?</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-1"><span class="bold">Knowing Jesus: Imagination</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">If you have ever watched a film adaptation of a favourite book, you will have had the experience of looking at the actor cast in the lead role and thinking, ‘<span class="italic">That’s </span>not how I imagined him looking!’ (‘No, no, no – his hair should be curlier. And he should be a bit stockier, shouldn’t he? And, anyway, shouldn’t Frodo be about fifty when he leaves the Shire? What’s Elijah Wood, fift<span class="italic">een</span>?’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-347" id="footnote-169-347-backlink">347</a></span>) Strangely enough, our ability to make these kinds of judgement does not at all depend upon our having a clear, consistent mental picture of the character in question. We will far more likely have a rag-bag of mental odds and ends: a vague image of what his eyes might look like; a remembered verbal description of his hair, with no real mental picture attached to it; a rather nebulous ‘feel’ for the kinds of clothes he might wear – and so on. A collection of fragments, glimpses, ideas, feelings and constraints, which will almost certainly not be enough to determine exactly what the character <span class="italic">does</span> look like for us, and which may not even be consistent.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Something like this can be found in some cubist paintings, such as Diego Rivera’s 1914 portrait of Jacques Lipchitz (see Plate 7).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-348" id="footnote-169-348-backlink">348</a></span> Rather than trying to paint the coherent original – the actual human face – to which all his fragmentary perceptions of Lipchitz referred, Rivera tried instead to paint those fragments themselves: a feature here, a vague sense of a shape or a bulk there, all the glimpses and glances, hints and suggestions, seen from a variety of perspectives, which are the bits and pieces that actually lodged in his mind as he got to know the face of his sitter. With Rivera’s portrait in hand, one could just about imagine sizing up an identity parade of men pretending to be the sitter and saying of each one, ‘No, <span class="italic">he</span>’s not right’, without necessarily being able to construct from the painting a single coherent image of what the real Lipchitz <span class="italic">does</span> look like.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian life, I have claimed, has at its heart penitent attention to Jesus of Nazareth as the visibility of the life of God. In other words, Christian life is, or should be, decisively shaped by what people know of Jesus of Nazareth. But what does it mean to ‘know Jesus’?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">If you ask what kind of mental image any individual Christian has of Jesus of Nazareth, you are unlikely to find a single, clear, coherent portrait and likely to find something more like a cubist painting: a bewildering mosaic of disparate elements. An individual believer might well carry round in his or her mind fragments of narrative, general impressions of character traits, images from paintings and childhood picture books, snatches of songs, a collection of biblical and traditional titles and epithets, a feeling that some things ‘just don’t fit’ with who Jesus was, and a sense that some other things do or should – a shifting collage of bits and pieces culled from years of sermons, Bible readings, hymns, children’s books, conversations and meditations. There will also probably be, tied in rather haphazardly with all this, some rather more nebulous ideas about how this Jesus relates to God, and how God relates to this Jesus, perhaps as no more than a kind of halo or gold background to the main mosaic, perhaps as a central and constitutive element.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-349" id="footnote-169-349-backlink">349</a></span></p>

				<p class="quotes">21‘Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord”, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only one who does the will of my Father in heaven. 22On that day many will say to me, “Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many deeds of power in your name?” 23Then I will declare to them, “I never knew you; go away from me, you evildoers.”’</p>
				<p class="quotes-RR">Matthew 7.21–23</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">It may be, however, that to ask about the ‘mental image’ that people have of Jesus is to get off on the wrong foot. Perhaps one could think of the possession of a good mental image of Jesus as being like the knowledge of the name of Jesus claimed by the evildoers in Matthew 7. They know Jesus’ name, but they are not obedient to his Father. Jesus tells them that <span class="italic">he</span> does not know <span class="italic">them</span>, and we might also deduce that, in some sense, <span class="italic">they</span> do not really know <span class="italic">him</span>. Perhaps we should not be asking how Christians imagine Christ, but how they obey<span class="italic"> </span>him. That is, perhaps we should be asking how Christians reflect him, or are patterned after him, in all that they do.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-350" id="footnote-169-350-backlink">350</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">If the theology presented in this book is correct, however, we cannot simply turn away from Christian imagination to Christian life in this way – or rather, we can’t divorce the two. I have argued that, according to the doctrine of the incarnation, it is Jesus himself who is God’s address to the world, calling the world to godly life; God’s message to the world is not detachable from the human life in which that message is given. To focus on Christians’ living reflection of Christ is also to focus on how they respond to, are shaped by, are held in relationship with, this specific human being. I can’t see any way of talking about such response, such relationship, without at least <span class="italic">some</span> reference to Christians’ imagination of Jesus and to how that imagination helps shape their lives. Knowledge of Jesus, we might say, is a matter of imagination wrapped up in a way of life, or a way of life wrapped up in imagination.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Jesus laughing</span></p>
				<p class="text">I remember a discussion when I was at college about what it did to one’s understanding of the Gospels if, as a thought experiment, one tried to imagine Jesus as a brawny bull of a man, full of loud laughter. A friend of mine suggested the actor Brian Blessed as a model.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-351" id="footnote-169-351-backlink">351</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The trouble is that as soon as we ask how a Christian’s life is shaped in accordance with his or her imagination of Jesus, we get back into muddy water. After all, the processes by which a person’s image of Jesus has been learnt and refined are messily mixed in with the processes by which his or her Christian life itself has been learnt and refined. Neither side of the equation can be described simply, and the way in which the two sides have grown together is difficult to tease out.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, there is likely to be some kind of rough and ready coherence between a person’s image of Jesus and her life. It is unlikely, for instance, that someone deeply committed to a ‘health and wealth’ form of Christian life is going to have an image of Jesus in which poverty is a central part of the collage. This rough and ready coherence might well be strong enough for a serious change in the circumstances or direction of a person’s life to send shock waves through her image of Jesus, or for a serious challenge to her picture of Jesus to set off repercussions in her life. So, for instance, the health-and-wealth Christian might find that her image of Jesus comes alive in new ways if her material prosperity is suddenly devastated, or she might start to become uncomfortable about her health-and-wealth thinking if she does become convinced, for whatever reason, that poverty <span class="italic">was </span>a central facet of Christ’s life.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-352" id="footnote-169-352-backlink">352</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is hard to imagine, however, someone who could confidently declare what the implication of each facet of her image of Jesus was for her life, or how each part of her life was related to her image of Jesus. We could think instead, perhaps, of a Christian’s life and imagination as a giant game of spillikins. That is, life and imagination are jumbled together like a pile of sticks, and as one tries to take one stick, thinking that it is relatively independent and can be moved on its own, or thinking that one knows exactly how that stick rests on others and how others rest on it, one suddenly discovers that the situation is more confused than one thought: the slightest movement sets off unexpected tremors through the rest of the pile – and one’s turn is over. Christians’ imaginations of Jesus and their living responses to him are not two neatly separable realities, linked in simple causal ways. They are, rather, messily mixed together in a pile that may have settled for now into a reasonably stable pattern, but which has all sorts of unexpected interconnections that will only show themselves when one part of the pile is disturbed.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The rough coherence between image and life that there might be – all the spillikins for now settled into a stable arrangement – will have come about under all sorts of influences, over a lifetime. It may well, for instance, have had a good deal to do with participation in communities that have themselves established patterns of coherence between vision and life over long periods of time. However, one of the main ways in which Christians have played spillikins with their lives and imaginations, deliberately disturbing the pile with the hope of tumbling it into better order, is by reading the Bible.</p>

					<li class="bullet-list">A believer’s imagination of Jesus is likely to be messily and inextricably linked in with the life of discipleship he or she lives.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christian communities can over long periods of time establish patterns in which imagination and life are held together with relative stability and coherence.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">One of the practices that can challenge and disturb such a settlement is the reading of the Bible.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-5"><span class="bold">A biblical kaleidoscope</span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">What effect does the Bible have upon Christian lives and imaginations? One might think, after all, that the way past all the messy confusion I have just been describing is to turn to its pages. Don’t Christians find there a true image of Jesus, and a true guide to how to live in response to him? Won’t a belief in the authority of Scripture allow the unruly spillikins of Christian life and imagination to be properly disciplined?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">One difficulty with this idea is that the biblical portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth is itself already diverse, complicated and difficult to synthesize. There are four Gospels, each of which tells the story of Jesus in its own way, and much of each is made up of collections of short narratives and snatches of teaching that don’t readily form simple unities. And then there are numerous other New Testament writings, which witness to Christ in varying degrees and in widely differing ways, which may not contain very much by way of extra narratives of Jesus’ life but which certainly affect how Jesus’ identity and significance are understood. The Bible itself provides something more like a cubist portrait of Jesus than a photograph.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-353" id="footnote-169-353-backlink">353</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, there are some forms of unity that Christian readers have fairly consistently found in the text, and which do shape much Christian imagination of Christ. Whatever strange and wonderful esoteric or allegorical forms of interpretation they have gone for, Christians have on the whole agreed that these texts tell the story of a man preaching and healing, going to Jerusalem, being captured, being tortured and crucified, and rising again from the dead – even if some Christians have not regarded every element of that story as straightforwardly factually true.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-354" id="footnote-169-354-backlink">354</a></span> In most of the endlessly varied ways in which Christians have worked with the Gospels, the recognition that they tell versions of this core story has been something like a bedrock, even if very different structures have been built upon it. One could say that the vast majority of Christian imaginings of Jesus will have these bare bones of the narrative somewhere within them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The moment one goes beyond this basic framework of a narrative, however, and asks what people have learnt of Jesus from the Bible that is rich enough to live by, readings begin to diverge. Even if one simply tries to put a bit of flesh on the bones, and fit in more of the detail that the Gospels have to present concerning the course of this man’s life, things start to get difficult. It <span class="italic">is</span> possible to create syntheses that tie the different Gospels into one coherent, graspable story, that might then bid to become <span class="italic">the </span>image of Jesus burnt onto the reader’s retina, but such harmonization has proved to require significant ingenuity, and each person who has done it has produced a synthesis that looks different (in at least some respects) from all the others.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-355" id="footnote-169-355-backlink">355</a></span> And if one goes further and begins to ask how it is that the Jesus whose identity is portrayed here is not simply an interesting character from a bygone era, but is an address from God, a divine call to new life – well, Christian claims and counter-claims become very diverse indeed. What kind of life does the Bible suggest is an appropriate response to Jesus? How should the Bible be used to help form such lives? Christians, even those who share a very high view of the Bible’s capacity to give clear and direct answers to these questions, have differed significantly on these matters.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This variety of opinion on what response to Jesus looks like, and how it should be inculcated, can be seen already within the New Testament itself, particularly in the various letters by Paul and other writers placed after the Gospels and Acts. Those letters are all, more or less directly, attempts to explore and spell out the implications of Jesus’ life for Christian lives, and the range of ideas and metaphors and models, advice and commands and suggestion that they offer is beyond any simple coherence.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-356" id="footnote-169-356-backlink">356</a></span> Here, too, it is possible to come up with some harmonization of all these ideas, metaphors and models, but it requires a good deal of ingenuity, and different interpreters have done it in very different ways over the years.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In other words, as well as being faced with the strangely diffuse and fractured nature of any person or community’s mental image of Jesus, and with the messy and complicated ways in which that image is bound up with the lives Christians live as a response to Jesus, Christians are faced with a bewilderingly complex biblical portrayal of him, and with complex and various biblical accounts of the difference that Jesus should make to human lives. Anyone who claims that there is a simple, graspable answer here, and that the diversity and messiness of Christian imagination of, and response to, Jesus, needs only to turn to the Bible to be made truthful and coherent, has quite a bit of work to do to make that claim convincing.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-357" id="footnote-169-357-backlink">357</a></span></p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Perhaps even more important than the variety and complexity of the biblical portraits of Jesus is the fact that reading is not a process in which those portraits are simply downloaded into the reader’s brain. The relationship between the Bible and Christian imagination and life is two-way. The lives and imaginations of Christian communities and individuals will be shaped in some ways by their readings of the Bible, but their readings of the Bible will also, however hard they try to be faithful to it, be shaped in some ways by their lives and imaginations. After all, nobody who reads the Bible is an empty and spacious room, simply ready to be filled with ideas and ways of living carried in from the Bible. People always already have plenty of mental furniture (some expectations, some pre-judgements, some prior entanglements with some of the subject matter) cluttering their minds. As they read the Bible, they will be trying to find space in this cluttered room for what they read – and it will only be by some more-or-less awkward process of rearrangement and clearing out that a workable arrangement will be found. They will throw away some of their existing furniture, but keep hold of much of it, even if some of it has to be put in new places or pushed into the background. They will find good, prominent spaces for what they take to be the most important or attractive items they have found in the Bible, but they will cram in a lot of other stuff from the Bible any old how, squeezing it into odd corners, perhaps rather squashed and hidden away; and there will be plenty more for which they simply don’t find room. Everyone’s arrangement will look different, depending on the furniture they started with. If I may push this metaphor one step further, we might also say that people are in any case living in rooms of very different shapes and sizes. That is, people live in very different contexts, facing very different demands; the space in which one person arranges her mental furniture may be very, very different from the space in which another person arranges his. To put it another way, reading the Bible is not simply the preserve of those who read out of curiosity, interested in the abstract in seeing how their ideas might be rearranged and supplemented by it. The Bible is not simply read by people arranging the furniture in spacious rooms in detached houses far from the bustle of the city. It is done by people embroiled in relationships and institutions and projects and crises and movements and histories: in rooms squeezed in between other rooms in crowded apartment blocks, having to find ways of living in those rooms that will still allow them to get on with their neighbours and keep some kind of workable life in the midst of others’ din and bustle. What people take from the Bible, the meaning that they find there, will be subtly or dramatically, explicitly or implicitly affected by all of this.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Even a very biblically minded believer, who may well end up with a very biblically informed image of Christ that has a fair amount of coherence to it, will certainly also find that her image is not simply and straightforwardly <span class="italic">the</span> undisputed biblical image of Jesus, still less that her understanding of what call this Jesus makes upon her life is <span class="italic">the</span> undisputed understanding. On the one hand, her working image of Christ will be mixed from biblical and non-biblical sources, shaped by hymns and sermons and picture-books and films and conversations and dreams and meditations that subtly or blatantly, consciously or unconsciously go beyond or even against what is written. And on the other hand, even to the extent that this image <span class="italic">is</span> biblical, not every element of the biblical portrayal of Jesus will be equally well caught by this believer’s imagination: there will be elements of the biblical witness that are emphasized, elements that are downplayed, elements that are ignored or forgotten, and elements that don’t really seem to fit, and which continue to act as irritants, calling into question the image that the believer has constructed.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Jesus and alcohol</span></p>
				<p class="text">As one fairly small example, consider the way in which many devoutly Bible-believing Christians are adamant that Jesus never touched a drop of alcohol – and that Christians should forswear it too. They regard the accusation recorded in Luke 7.34 that Jesus was a ‘winebibber’ to be an entirely groundless slur (rather than an exaggeration) and argue that the ‘wine’ that he is said to drink in Luke 7.33, or into which he turned the water at Cana, or that was consumed at the Last Supper, must have been <span class="italic">unfermented </span>grape juice – often getting embroiled in long philological arguments at this point. If you try typing ‘Jesus alcohol’ into an internet search engine, you will soon find impassioned arguments on both sides of the question.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-359" id="footnote-169-359-backlink">359</a></span> It does not take much examination of the arguments employed to see that a given commentator’s position is seldom defined purely by their unbiased reading of the Gospel texts in question: they read the texts in the light of a whole maze of ideas and feelings that subtly or dramatically, consciously or unconsciously shape what meanings they find there.</p>
				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">If you have internet access, spend some time hunting out arguments used on both sides. How would you characterize the debate? Is it one that truly focuses on differences about particular matters of fact (the etymology of certain words, the parsing of certain passages), or are those matters proxies for broader, deeper concerns?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-6"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Bible contains a variety of differing portraits of Jesus, which cannot be harmonized without effort.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">There is basic agreement among most Christian readers on the bare bones of the story that the Gospels tell about Jesus (though not on the factuality of that story).</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">There is wide disagreement on the detail and implications of the Bible’s portrayal of Jesus.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">A person’s understanding of Jesus will be shaped by his or her reading of the Bible, but not simply dictated by that reading.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-7"><span class="bold">Biblical settlements</span></p>
				<p class="text">Despite all this diversity and complexity, Christian individuals and communities do tend in the end to come up with answers. That is, they come up with claims about the meaning of the Bible that seem to them to do justice to all of its diverse materials and that help them make sense of their own lives.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">One very resilient example of such a conviction is that held by many evangelical groups, whose reading of the Bible (or at least the New Testament) revolves around a simple narrative that they believe to be the clear message of the New Testament. Human beings were made for eternal glory with God, but all have sinned and fallen short of this glory; the penalty and power of sin is such that no one is capable of saving himself; nevertheless, Christ has died to pay the penalty for this sin, and all you have to do to be saved is acknowledge that you are a sinner and incapable of saving yourself, accept Jesus into your heart as your personal saviour, and confess openly that he is Lord. For the sake of convenience, I’ll refer to this as the ‘personal saviour settlement’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, you will not find this precise narrative set out plainly and in full in any one place in the Bible, even though some parts of the book of Romans get close; neither will you find the phrase ‘personal saviour’. The proponents of the personal saviour settlement claim, however, that it is a way – or, rather, <span class="italic">the</span> way – of summarizing the central teachings of the New Testament. This narrative has become, for many evangelical Christians, the lens through which the whole New Testament is read, such that most if not all of the rest of the New Testament is taken to be reinforcing or amplifying aspects of this narrative, or spelling out its implications – even in those books in which this narrative itself does not make any very obvious appearance.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Although in certain circumstances proponents of this narrative will quote individual verses or short passages in order to justify their claim that it is the core meaning of the New Testament, the real support for that claim is more difficult to grasp quickly. Much of the justification for the claim that this narrative does justice to the New Testament lies in its <span class="italic">capaciousness</span> and its <span class="italic">resilience</span>. That is, the justification lies on the one hand in the <span class="italic">capacity</span> of interpretation that takes this narrative as its guide to make good enough sense of very large amounts of the New Testament, and its ability to make sense of otherwise obscure and difficult passages. The justification lies on the other hand in the <span class="italic">resilience</span> with which interpreters committed to this narrative can respond to challenges from those who claim that particular verses or passages contradict it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Those who make this kind of claim to have identified the core meaning of the Bible will tend to privilege certain parts of the Bible over others, having what is sometimes called ‘a canon within the canon’. The proponents of the personal saviour settlement, for instance, tend to find their core ideas more easily in the Pauline epistles than in the Gospels. That does not mean, of course, that they ignore the Gospels, simply that some interpretative work is needed in order to see how the Gospels, too, proclaim this core narrative. Such interpretative work may involve emphasizing those passages that can more easily be seen to support this narrative, such as Jesus’ forgiveness of sins in response to people’s faith (for example, Mark 2.1–12); it may involve carefully explaining how other passages really do fit with the personal saviour narrative, even though at first blush they seem to contradict it (such as, the tying of entry into the kingdom to full obedience to the law in Matthew 5.17–20). The Gospels are interpreted so as to fit the personal saviour narrative, even though it might not be all that clear that someone who <span class="italic">only </span>had the Gospels would necessarily hit upon this narrative as a summary. Other books or passages which sit rather awkwardly with this narrative (the book of James, for instance, with its emphasis on works, or Colossians 1.24, in which Paul says, ‘In my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body’) are argued about and discussed until an interpretation is found that allows them to fit with the narrative.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-360" id="footnote-169-360-backlink">360</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is more going on here, however, than a simple claim as to the central meaning of a text. The interpretation offered by proponents of the personal saviour settlement coheres with various convictions about what the Bible is for, and how it should shape Christian life. They are likely to think, for instance, that the Bible’s role is at least twofold: that it is there to convict the world of sin, and that it is there to give the good news of what Jesus has done, so that people may explicitly put their trust in it. So, for instance, someone committed to this settlement is liable to look at Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount, and in particular at Jesus’ claim there that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven (5.20) and that people should ‘Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect’ (5.48), and think that the <span class="italic">primary</span> role of these passages is to convince us how far we have fallen short, how incapable we are of obeying, and how much we must therefore throw ourselves upon the mercy of Christ.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-361" id="footnote-169-361-backlink">361</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">These convictions about what the Bible is for will also shape the interpretation given in more subtle ways, however. They are likely to mean, for instance, that the ability of the Bible to present one accurately with the facts about Jesus and what he has done is highly valued, because knowledge of those facts is necessary if one is to place one’s trust in him. And they are likely to mean that passages of the Bible that sound most like direct evangelistic address to non-believers or waverers (or the reminders of such address) are consciously or unconsciously given special weight in determining what the meaning of the whole is.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">These convictions about meaning and function also live in complex symbiosis with many other aspects of the life of the Christian communities in which they are found. So, for instance, the personal saviour construal of the meaning of the New Testament coheres with certain kinds of evangelistic preaching, focused on inviting people to an explicit moment of commitment; it coheres with the idea that individual believers will normally be able to give their testimonies, describing how they became Christians (perhaps referring to the verses that convicted and convinced them); it coheres with calling individual members of the Church ‘believers’ in the first place – and so on. There is a whole weave of practices, of ways of living and talking, that make sense in the light of this way of reading the Bible, and that weave of practices in turn helps reinforce the sense that this is the true and proper way to read the Bible.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is why I refer to this personal saviour interpretation as a ‘settlement’. It is not just a claim to have identified the true meaning of the Bible. It is also a set of ideas about the Bible’s nature and function that underpins those claims about its meaning. And those ideas in turn seem convincing in part because of their coherence with the weave of practices that make up the common life of those who hold it. The proponents of this settlement have reached a point where these three things mutually reinforce one another: their convictions as to the proper shape of Christian life, their understanding of what the Bible is for and how it should be read, and their claims about what the Bible actually says. Each confirms and supports the others.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Think of it this way. Imagine a tribe living in a clearing in the rainforest. They devote a good deal of their energy to coppicing the trees around the clearing’s edge in a particular way. When tended in that way, the trees yield strong, straight, flexible timbers that the tribe are able to use in their lives. They use them to build their huts in the middle of the clearing, for instance, and as fishing rods and as weapons. They also use them, however, to provide the very tools that they need to do the coppicing on the trees around the edge of the clearing. They have reached a ‘settlement’: their ways of using the trees yield material that supports their whole way of life, and the production of that material justifies and enables their ways of using the trees. Just so, proponents of a biblical settlement like the personal saviour settlement have found ways of approaching and using the Bible that yields materials that support and enable their whole way of life, and that includes supporting and enabling their ways of approaching and using the Bible.</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Mainstream evangelical Christianity’s ‘personal saviour’ is one example of a Biblical settlement.</li>

					<li class="bullet-list">It can be judged according to its capaciousness and resilience.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">It involves privileging a canon within the canon.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">It coheres with, and is supported by, appropriate practices.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-9"><span class="bold">The multiplicity of settlements</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">There is more than one robust biblical settlement in existence. The personal saviour settlement that I described in the last section is not the only possibility. There are other contenders, whose adherents claim that they are just as capacious, just as resilient, just as habitable as the personal saviour settlement.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Settlements can differ in multiple ways. They may have different focal meanings – so they may, for instance, not agree that ‘accept Jesus as your personal saviour’ is a good summary of the New Testament. They may even have no focal meaning at all: some settlements don’t like the assumption that there is one central meaning to the diverse New Testament texts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Settlements may involve different assumptions about how the Bible functions. So while the personal saviour settlement might involve regarding the Bible as convicting of sin and telling readers enough about Jesus that they can put their trust in him, in other settlements the Bible may be construed more as a connected narrative of salvation-history that tells the story of which one has now become a part, or as a manual of moral and spiritual teaching that one is to follow, or as a source of metaphors and symbols by which one may imagine God more truly, or as the historical record of the early years of the faith, or as something else again.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Settlements may also differ in the practices that surround and support, and are in turn supported by, the practices of biblical reading: where one settlement has evangelistic proclamation, the other may have meditative homilies; where one has the giving of personal testimonies of conversion, the other may have stories of the lives of saints; and so on. Settlements have differing weaves of practices roughly cohering with different emphases and tendencies in biblical reading – and those practices are both supported by the settlement’s way reading of the Bible, and help make that way of reading the Bible seem natural and appropriate.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Settlements may also differ in the social organization of biblical reading. In some settlements, a minister’s sermon will be the primary location in which the meaning of the Bible is expounded, in others it will be Bible-study notes and popular books, in others small-group Bible study, in others the teaching office of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, for someone firmly socialized into a particular settlement, the idea that there could be multiple working settlements might seem absurd. Within a settlement, the preferred interpretation of the Bible might seem so natural, so unforced, so attentive and honest that talk of an alternative settlement is likely to be seen simply as a fancy way of covering up the fact that some churches and Christian groups are just plain unbiblical.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One of the things that can help overcome this sense of the inevitability of any one settlement is a sense of history. All settlements evolve over time, getting shaken by changes in circumstances, challenged by new currents of theological thinking, fragmenting over controversial issues or simply breaking up because different groups have drifted off in their own directions. But this means that settlements have a <span class="italic">history</span>; it is possible to tell the history of the personal saviour settlement, for instance, and see that, far from being a clear ongoing consensus among honest Bible-believing Christians as to the obvious way of reading the Bible, that settlement has changed and evolved over time, and now exists in multiple differing forms. The version of the settlement to be found among eighteenth-century Prussian brethren looks different from the version to be found among nineteenth-century English Methodists, or among twentieth-century American Baptists, or among twenty-first century Nigerian Anglicans. Emphases change; the way the focal meaning of the New Testament is expressed changes; the passages that are regarded as central change; the explanation of problem passages change; the implications for Christian life change; the reading practices of those involved change; and all the surrounding and supporting ways of life of the communities involved change.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-362" id="footnote-169-362-backlink">362</a></span></p>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-11"><span class="bold">Deciding between settlements</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">To acknowledge this diversity and evolution of biblical settlements does not mean opting for a simple relativism. That is, it does not mean that one can only say, ‘Each group to its own interpretation; who are we to judge?’ It does not mean that one has to abandon the idea of conversation, challenge, argument or agreement between people from different settlements. It does not mean one has to abandon the idea of <span class="italic">responsible</span> interpretation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I explained above that a settlement can be judged, in part, by its capaciousness (its ability to make sense of as wide a range of biblical texts as possible) and by its resilience (its ability to respond to difficult questions and problem passages). We might add that a settlement can also be judged by its habitability – that is, by the extent to which it makes for a context in which human lives can be lived, and be sustained across the generations, and provide its inhabitants with resources to meet the challenges of a changing and crisis-ridden world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, any given settlement is open to genuine critique. Faced with a working settlement, one does not simply have to accept it wholesale or reject it outright. One can ask whether it really does justice to the full range of Scripture; one can press its available interpretations of crucial passages; one can ask whether, in the end, people are truly able to live under its branches. Real criticism, real argument is possible. And while it is extraordinarily unlikely that one critique is going to deflate an entire settlement, these kinds of challenges are one of the motors by which settlements evolve – and one of the pressures that lead some settlements over time to collapse.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">So settlements are not take-it-or-leave-it supermarket options: they can be the subjects of real discussion, real debate. Nevertheless, it is seldom possible to find any simple, knock-down argument that tells you which settlement is the right one, which has got the best reading of the Bible. Arguments <span class="italic">between</span> settlements (rather than arguments that seek to test the limits of a settlement in its own terms) are notoriously unproductive, because so often what seems to be a crucial point or a key verse to one group will seem secondary or irrelevant to another, and because any settlement worth the name has over time developed a whole host of strategies for seeing off challenges and difficult questions, and because arguments that look simple on the surface are often plugged in underneath to large complexes of practices, tendencies and attitudes buried deep in the settlement’s heart. Arguments between settlements – at least, any which look for a quick victory for one side or the other – very often sound like dialogues of the deaf.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-21-13"><span class="bold">A Trinitarian settlement</span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Rather than spend time arguing against other settlements, therefore, I am going to devote it to exploring my own settlement in some detail – looking particularly at the way in which the meanings championed by this settlement affect the way its proponents think it appropriate to use the Bible, indeed their understanding of what the Bible <span class="italic">is</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Most of that exploration has, of course, already been put before you. The whole of this book could be thought of as an outline sketch of a biblical settlement that differs from the personal saviour settlement. Instead of the personal saviour narrative described above, I have been arguing that a certain kind of Trinitarian picture – one whose core narrative has to do with a journey into the triune life of God – can provide an organizing framework for making good sense of the Bible, and I have been suggesting some of the ways of life that might cohere with, and help make sense of, this Trinitarian picture.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">You may already have noticed that I have worked with biblical materials in a variety of ways. And some of you may well have found my biblical forays rather inconclusive or unconvincing. If, for instance, you come from a biblical settlement that tries to back up every theological claim with lists of verses in which the principle at stake is clearly stated and defended, my uses of the Bible may well have seemed eccentric and inadequate.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">I am sure that there is some truth in that, and that some of the attempts I have made to expound biblical passages will have been failures. Nevertheless, another factor is also in play. I have taken myself to be introducing readers to a whole settlement, and one that may well be unfamiliar, rather than trying to convince people of particular points of controversy within an already-shared consensus. That is, I am trying to lure people in to a whole way of seeing the Bible’s meaning (indeed, as we shall see, a whole way of seeing what the Bible is and what it is for), and that cannot be done simply by the citation of ‘proof-texts’.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Proof-texting</span></p>
				<p class="text">The practice of citing individual verses or short passages in order to prove a theological point is sometimes called ‘proof-texting’. It sometimes comes in for strident criticism, but there is no doubt that, between people who share a settlement, it can be a very powerful technique. To those who share ground-rules for reading Scripture, and who share assumptions about the big biblical picture within which individual verses sit, the citation of particular verses can be an important argumentative move. For instance, in the debate mentioned earlier, some argue that Jesus can’t have drunk alcohol because Proverbs 31.4 says ‘It is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to desire strong drink.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-363" id="footnote-169-363-backlink">363</a></span> For this to work as an argument, you must inhabit a settlement that sees Jesus as the fulfilment of Old Testament kingship, that believes that this can only be true if Jesus fulfilled all the righteous demands made of kings in the Old Testament, that regards a text like this from Proverbs as an unambiguous command, and so on. If all that is in place, the proof-text really does work – or at least leaves your opponent with a strong case to answer.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Such proof-texting seldom makes sense when speaking to those outside a settlement or who inhabit a different settlement, however, because they will not necessarily share enough of the surrounding interpretative framework for that verse taken out of context to mean the same to them. So people who inhabit a different kind of biblical settlement may well, when faced with Proverbs 31.4 in an argument about Jesus’ attitude to alcohol, simply not see that it is particularly relevant – whether because they see the nature of Proverbs differently, or the nature of Jesus’ relationship to the Old Testament, or the nature of moral instruction, or for other reasons.</p>
				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">Next time you come across an apparent proof-text (that is, some passage which appears to cite a biblical verse as proof of a theological point) ask what assumptions are in play. What do you have to believe for that citation to <span class="italic">count</span> as an argument in favour of that point?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In Chapter 2, I made use of material from Exodus and 1 John. I chose passages that have been taken by many Christians (and, in the case of Exodus, many Jews) as keys to understanding the nature of God; these passages have become, as it were, common currency across several very different Christian and Jewish biblical settlements, historical and contemporary. I worked within that broad tradition of reading by taking these texts as guides to the nature of God – but tried to provide a reading of the text (highlighting various features, suggesting ways of ‘making sense’ of the passages as a whole) that would lead people towards the particular settlement I find most convincing. Of course, my reading of these individual texts could not provide a knock-down proof that my favoured settlement was superior or even simply plausible. Those kinds of conclusion could not rest on the reading of any one passage in Exodus or 1 John or anywhere else; they have to rest on the overall capaciousness, resilience and habitability of the settlement as a whole.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In Chapter 4, I tried to make at least an initial case for the broad plausibility of a Trinitarian construal of the New Testament. I talked about broad narrative patterns in the Gospels (both that which has Jesus and the Spirit pointing to the Father, and that which has the Father and the Spirit pointing to Jesus); I talked about particular narrative incidents in which those patterns receive a crystallized form (Jesus’ baptism and transfiguration); I talked about discursive passages in which aspects of those patterns are directly described (particularly in John’s Gospel); and I talked about what one could call the distinctive twofold and threefold grammar for talk about God that began to emerge in the early decades of the Christian Church. Just as in the previous chapter, none of this amounted to a direct and deductive proof of the doctrine. It was, rather, a way of saying, ‘Do you see how these Trinitarian claims help us to take account of, and make coherent sense of, a wide range of biblical materials? Do you see how this might even be a framework for making sense of all relevant New Testament material?’</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In the next chapter, I want to explore this Trinitarian settlement a little further, but from a somewhat different perspective.

See Malcolm Lambert, <span class="italic">Franciscan Poverty: The Doctrine of the Absolute Poverty of Christ and the Apostles in the Franciscan Order, 1210–1323</span>, revised edn (St Bonaventure, NY: Franciscan Institute, 1998).

						<p class="Endnote-Text"><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-169-354-backlink" id="footnote-169-354">354</a> Hans Frei referred to this consensus as ‘ascriptive literalism’; see ‘The “Literal Reading” of Biblical Narrative in the Christian Tradition: Does it Stretch or Will it Break?’ in Frei, <span class="italic">Theology and Narrative</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>ed. George Hunsinger and William C. Placher (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 122<span class="bold">. </span>It may seem an entirely trivial form of agreement, but there have been thinkers who have disagreed. For instance, John M. Allegro, in <span class="italic">The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross </span>(London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1970) argued that the Gospels are not really stories about a man called Jesus at all; they are coded descriptions of a cult based around hallucinogenic mushrooms, giving instructions for finding and consuming the drugs, and portrayals of the effects; the name ‘Jesus’, and the stories apparently about him, are ciphers. I’m not making this up.</p>

						<p class="Endnote-Text"><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-169-357-backlink" id="footnote-169-357">357</a> Some readers will think that I am, for my own polemical purposes, exaggerating this diversity and complexity of the biblical witness. Surely, they will say, the Scriptures are coherent enough and clear enough to teach a common message to all those who are truly willing to learn? Well, a famous experiment has been done to explore that claim. It is an experiment that has involved watching what kinds of agreements and disagreements arise when one tracks very large numbers of Christians who are committed to following the Bible as their supreme authority, and to mining the clear, coherent message that it offers. The experiment is called Protestantism, and it has been running for nearly 500 years – and it has turned out to lead to what is, by a very wide margin, the most fissile form of Christianity on the planet. By some counts, there are something like 8,000 Protestant denominations, most of which claim that <span class="italic">their</span> way is truly biblical, and that their distinction from the 7,999 other forms of Protestantism can be put down to their own more perfect understanding of Scripture.</p>

						<p class="Endnote-Text"><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-169-360-backlink" id="footnote-169-360">360</a> Martin Luther went so far as to argue that the Epistle of James, because it harmonized so little with his ‘justification by faith’ settlement, should not be numbered among the full books of the Bible and should be relegated to a secondary status. See his 1522 Preface to James in <span class="italic">Luther’s Works</span>, vol.35, ed. E.T. Buchanan (Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1960), pp. 395–8. Luther says of the epistle that it ‘is flatly against St. Paul and all the rest of Scripture in ascribing justification to works’.</p>

He says ‘The purpose of the Sermon was not to reveal Church truth but to condemn the Jews and to show them that they were not fit to enter the kingdom’ … ‘Though the gospel is not revealed in this Sermon, the Lord did make it clear that the solution for those who lack the needed righteousness is found, not in SELF, but in HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS (Matt. 6.33). Thus we have the first beatitude (Matt. 5.3) showing the blessedness of the person who recognizes his own spiritual bankruptcy.’</p>
