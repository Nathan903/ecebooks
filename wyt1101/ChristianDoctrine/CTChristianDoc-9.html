				<p class="text">In this chapter, I am going to approach the same territory that I explored in Chapter 4, but from a different direction, and with my focus firmly and constantly on Jesus. What kind of centrality does Jesus have in Christian faith? Does he have the kind of centrality in Christianity that one would expect simply of a founder of an influential movement? Does he have the centrality that one would expect of a great hero, or one endowed with remarkable powers? Does he have the centrality of an abiding exemplar? I will use some artistic depictions of Jesus to guide my exploration of various different models of Jesus’ centrality, and approach by degrees the classical doctrinal claim that Jesus is one person, fully divine and fully human – that is, the claim that Jesus is central to Christianity because he is God’s own human life. In other words, the subject matter of this chapter is <span class="italic">Christology</span>: the doctrine of Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that any centrality Jesus has in Christianity he has as an entirely human being;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that Jesus can be seen as an exemplar of human life in all its fullness;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that by itself this is not enough, and could in fact have debilitating consequences for those who follow Jesus; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that Jesus must also be seen as God’s action on the world’s behalf, or God’s way of loving the world.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Preparation</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Classical Christian doctrine claims that Jesus is, at one and the same time, both ‘fully human’ and ‘fully divine’ – but what do these two claims mean? Jot down two brief paragraphs, clarifying for yourself what you think. What are the most important things being said, and what are the most important things being denied, when these two classical claims are made?</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">In this chapter, I will be showing you some famous pictures of Jesus, and presenting you with interpretations of those pictures. Spend some time now looking at pictures of Jesus without the clutter of my interpretations. There are plenty of places to look, especially online. For instance you could look on <span class="italic">Wikimedia Commons</span> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jesus_Christ, or Google Image Search http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=jesus, or Stephen Cook’s <span class="italic">Images of Jesus through Two Millennia</span> site, http://www.beliefnet.com/story/22/story_2283_1.html. Do some exploring. What images stand out? Which ones do you like? Which do you hate? Why?</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-1"><span class="bold">The face of Christ</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Deep in the Vatican, peering out from an elaborate seventeenth-century housing, there is an ancient, scarcely visible full-face portrait of a bearded man (see Plate 2). It was probably painted some time after the third century AD, but there is a legend attached to it that claims an older, stranger origin. This legend claims that there was an exchange of letters between Jesus and the ruler of the city of Edessa, a man called Abgar. The ruler is supposed to have sent his servant Hannan to Jesus with a letter saying,</p>
				<p class="quotes">Your deeds have come to my notice, and your healings performed without either medicine or herbs. Having heard all these deeds of yours, I have thought of two possible explanations: either that you are God and have come down from heaven and do these things, or that you are the Son of God. For this reason I have written to ask you to take the trouble to come to me and cure me of my disease.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-96" id="footnote-169-96-backlink">96</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Jesus was unable to go to Edessa because of all that he had to do in Israel, but he sent a reply saying,</p>
				<p class="quotes">Happy are you, having believed in me without having seen me, for it is written of me that those who shall see me shall not believe in me, and that those who shall not see me shall believe in me</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">and he allowed Hannan to take a portrait of him back to Abgar. In some versions of the legend it was Hannan (who turned out, conveniently, to be Abgar’s court painter) who painted the portrait; in other, more popular versions of the legend it was Jesus himself who provided the portrait, by miraculous means.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The legend is only one of several that circulated in the medieval Church attached to icons or statues intensely venerated as ‘true likenesses’ of Christ. There is the legend of St Veronica, who was said to have wiped Jesus’ face with a cloth when he was on the way to the cross, only to find that the cloth had become imprinted with an image of his face.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-97" id="footnote-169-97-backlink">97</a></span> There is the legend that St Luke himself painted a portrait of the infant Jesus in the arms of his mother.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-98" id="footnote-169-98-backlink">98</a></span> There is the legend that Nicodemus the Pharisee exhausted himself attempting to sculpt an image of Christ on the cross, only to have it completed one night by an angel.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-99" id="footnote-169-99-backlink">99</a></span> And, of course, there is also the much-debated Turin shroud – supposedly the burial cloth in which Jesus’ body was wrapped, miraculously preserving an imprint of his body.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Pen portrait</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">There is a once-famous medieval text that purports to be a letter written by a Roman official in Palestine at the time of Jesus’ ministry:</p>
				<p class="quotes">In these days there appeared, and there still is, a man of great power named Jesus Christ, who is called by the Gentiles the prophet of truth, whom his disciples call the Son of God, raising the dead and healing diseases: a man in stature middling tall, and comely, having a reverend countenance, which those who look upon may love and fear; having hair of the hue of an unripe hazelnut and smooth almost down to his ears, but from the ears in curling locks somewhat darker and more shining, flowing over his shoulders; having a parting at the middle of the head according to the fashion of the Nazareans; a brow smooth and very calm, with a face without wrinkle or any blemish, which a moderate red colour makes beautiful; with the nose and mouth no fault at all can be found; having a full beard of the colour of his hair, not long, but a little forked at the chin; having an expression simple and mature, the eyes grey, flashing, and clear; in rebuke terrible, in admonition kind and loveable, cheerful yet keeping gravity; sometimes he has wept, but never laughed; in stature of body tall and straight, with hands and arms fair to look upon; in talk grave, reserved and modest, fairer than the children of men.</p>
				<p class="source">Anonymous, <span class="italic">Letter of Lentulus</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-100" id="footnote-169-100-backlink">100</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">None of these (nor any of the other similar medieval legends) has any basis in fact, although some would except the Turin shroud, which still causes bitter debates between adherents and sceptics. But even if they don’t display Jesus’ features, they expose one of the connecting threads of Christian devotion: they witness to a fascination with Jesus Christ as a particular human being running through Christian life. They witness, that is, to the fact that Christianity has been animated not so much by commitment to a moral or spiritual <span class="italic">principle </span>as by captivation by a human <span class="italic">person</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, there are no known images of Jesus that can make any claim to be portraits painted in Jesus’ lifetime – nor any reason to think that such a portrait was every painted. Nor is there in the Gospels or in any other of the earliest written records of Christianity any attempt to describe Jesus’ physical appearance in words. For written descriptions one has to wait until the second century, and for actual attempts to draw, paint or sculpt something intended to be a <span class="italic">portrait</span> of Jesus one has to wait even longer.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-101" id="footnote-169-101-backlink">101</a></span> There does not, in other words, seem to be in very early Christianity the kind of fascination with images of Jesus that was to flourish in the medieval period, and that might seem to our image-saturated society to be a necessary expression of any real interest in the person himself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We do find, however, right from the very earliest forms of Christianity for which we have direct evidence, that the particular human being Jesus of Nazareth was a focus of Christian devotion, addressed in hymns and prayers and liturgical formulae. And we also find that one of the persistent shapes taken by that devotion was a fascination with passing on the <span class="italic">story</span> of Jesus. The early church was fascinated not so much by Jesus’ appearance, as by what he did and by what happened to him.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">What kind of centrality does Jesus have in Christian faith? These images of Christ clearly mean more than the portraits of the founder to be found on the boardroom wall of a modern business, and these stories about him are clearly more than interesting anecdotes. Jesus was not simply remembered because he was the founder of Christianity, nor because he was the one who first preached the Christian message. Jesus himself stands at the focus of Christian attention. Why is that?</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-3"><span class="bold">Fully human: Finitude and bodiliness</span></p>
				<p class="text">Georges de la Tour’s painting of a newborn child (see Plate 3) may or may not be a picture of the infant Jesus. It was first flatly catalogued as ‘representing a woman carrying a swaddled infant in her arms, and another woman holding a lit candle which illuminates the tableau’,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-102" id="footnote-169-102-backlink">102</a></span> and it may have been conceived simply as a touching domestic scene, a scene of great ordinariness. A mother cradles her newborn baby, wrapped tightly in swaddling cloths; baby and adoring mother are lit only by a single candle, shielded by the hand of another woman – the grandmother, perhaps, or a nurse. All needs met for the moment, the baby sleeps, wrapped and held, dependent and frail. The baby, the mother, the nurse – they could be anyone. Yet it is no surprise that a modern art historian describes it unhesitatingly as a picture of ‘St Anne and [the] Virgin to whom a child has been miraculously born’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-103" id="footnote-169-103-backlink">103</a></span>: it would not be too far out of place among a thousand other such images about which there is no question.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This possible confusion between domestic and religious subject matter is not insignificant. After all, much Christian devotion has anchored itself on the claim that the Jesus who stands at the centre of their devotion was once a tiny defenceless baby, frail and dependent, swaddled and nursed by his mother, in <span class="italic">just the same way </span>that other babies are.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet it was no foregone conclusion that Christian devotion should end up taking this form. There was a strong tendency in the ancient world for heroes to be seen as elevated above the ordinary constraints of humanity, and for a long time it looked as if Christianity was going to be no exception. One of the ways in which Jesus was claimed to be central to Christian faith and life was precisely as some kind of superhero, someone over whom the mess, dirt, pain and suffering of ordinary human life had no power, and from whom it ran like water off a duck’s back. A superhero like that would have the strength to carry his followers away from pain, suffering and confusion – or perhaps he would pass on to them his amazing powers?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">There are plenty of texts from the first few centuries of Christianity in which the <span class="italic">ordinariness</span> of Jesus’ humanity, its frailty and dependence, were vigorously denied. Jesus’ job, said some, was not to save us <span class="italic">as</span> human beings, but to save us <span class="italic">from</span> our humanity – to lift us out of finitude, bodiliness and diversity to some other sphere where we need not be troubled by them. How could he himself, if he was to save us from these things, have been mired in their fleshy mess? It is possible to find texts from the first centuries of the Church that state this quite blatantly. There are texts that claim that Jesus’ body had no ordinary bodily functions; there are texts that deny that he truly suffered; and there are texts that portray him as the enemy of the material world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-104" id="footnote-169-104-backlink">104</a></span> Even some quite mainstream texts show a good deal of the same embarrassment with the constraints of human nature. Eusebius of Caesarea, whose theology was in his day considered extremely respectable, wrote in his ‘Demonstration of the Gospel’ early in the fourth century after Christ that ‘There is no need to be disturbed in mind on hearing of the birth, human body, sufferings and death of the immaterial and unembodied Word of God’ – a claim that, of course, can’t but make one wonder whether his readers <span class="italic">were </span>likely to be disturbed by these things – and he goes on to speak of the divine Word taking on a human body and playing it like a lyre, a metaphor that could make Jesus’ body seem like a dispensable puppet for a divine puppeteer who will not himself be sullied by the sufferings and limitations that he allows the puppet to experience.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-105" id="footnote-169-105-backlink">105</a></span></p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">An ordinary baby</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">The African theologian Tertullian, who we met in Chapter 1, wrote a treatise <span class="italic">On the Flesh of Christ</span> in which he attacked the views of Marcion, a theologian who seems to have been embarrassed by the idea that Jesus might ever have been an ordinary baby.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-106" id="footnote-169-106-backlink">106</a></span> Tertullian addresses Marcion with heavy sarcasm:</p>
				<p class="quotes">Beginning then with that nativity you so strongly object to, orate, attack now, the nastiness of genital elements in the womb, the filthy curdling of moisture and blood, and of the flesh to be for nine months nourished on that same mire. Draw a picture of the womb getting daily more unmanageable, heavy, self-concerned, safe not even in sleep, uncertain in the whims of dislikes and appetites. … You shudder, of course, at the child passed out along with his afterbirth, and of course bedaubed with it. You think it shameful that he is straightened out with bandages, that he is licked into shape with applications of oil, that he is beguiled by coddling. This natural object of reverence you, Marcion, be-spittle: <span class="italic">yet how were you born</span>?</p>
				<p class="source">Tertullian, <span class="italic">On the Flesh of Christ</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-107" id="footnote-169-107-backlink">107</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Despite this tendency, it was in the end the affirmation that Jesus’ body, mind and soul were fully human that became definitive of Christian orthodoxy, if not always of Christian sensibility. When, in AD 451, the Council of Chalcedon issued an authoritative statement on Christology, a statement that was held to be binding by a large part of the Christian Church at the time, and has been since, it included the claims that Jesus was ‘perfect [i.e. complete] in manhood’, and that he had been made ‘in all things like unto us, sin only excepted’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-108" id="footnote-169-108-backlink">108</a></span> Such orthodox Christian faith asserts that Jesus is fully, unreservedly human: that he grew in Mary’s womb, that he was born bedaubed with afterbirth, and that he was ‘straightened out with bandages’, ‘licked into shape with applications of oil’, and ‘beguiled by coddling’, as Tertullian put it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We must reckon, orthodox Christian theology says, with a Jesus who has a human body, a human mind, human strengths and all those human weaknesses that are not themselves sinful, who thinks and acts in the way that human beings think and act – not only when an infant in his mother’s arms, but through his whole life, his passion and his death. Jesus of Nazareth is presented in the Gospels as a finite creature, one actor amongst many in a social scene. Like us, he lives in an environment he can’t fully control; like us he is hedged about by limits he can’t overcome. Like us he faces frustration; like us he is jostled in a confined space by the plans and actions of others. Like us, he can only act in limited ways, and he can only make a limited difference – and like us he has only a limited degree of control over the difference that he makes. Like us, he is dependent upon others. Like us, he can be injured; like us he can be killed.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And, like us, he was shaped by his context. He grew up at a particular time and in a particular place, enmeshed in a particular set of relationships; his identity was shaped by his environment, just as we are shaped by ours. He would have been shaped profoundly by his relationship with the mother who swaddled him, nursed him and raised him. To claim that Mary’s identity was irrelevant to Jesus’ identity would be to deny Jesus his full humanity – even if that doesn’t allow us easily to read anything of Mary’s character from that of the son whom she must have influenced so strongly. He was also shaped by growing up as a Jew in a Jewish world: his identity is a thoroughly and ineradicably Jewish identity, formed by Jewish practices, Jewish Scriptures, Jewish ideas, Jewish people, albeit at a time and in a place where Judaism was in complex interaction with the Hellenistic culture of the eastern Roman world. To deny the Jewishness of Jesus, to deny that it is constitutive of his identity, is to deny his full humanity: Judaism provided the womb from which the baby Jesus emerged, the swaddling bands that surrounded him from the moment that he appeared, and the nurture that allowed him to grow towards maturity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">All of this is part of what it means to be truly bodily, truly creaturely, truly particular. Jesus of Nazareth was fully, entirely, human; he was a finite creature. Whatever centrality in Christianity is claimed for Jesus, it must not – if it is to be consistent with this central affirmation –<span class="italic"> </span>involve any claim that Jesus was somehow insulated from his context, so as to receive his identity direct and fully formed from above; it must not involve any claim that Jesus had some extra faculty or capacity bolted on to this human nature like the superpower of a hero;<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-109" id="footnote-169-109-backlink">109</a></span> and it must not involve any claim that some aspect or part of this humanity was tinkered with so as to be immune from finitude. Jesus of Nazareth is, in orthodox Christian theology, unreservedly and unadulteratedly human. What place, then, does he have at the focus of Christian life?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Not quite human</span></p>
				<p class="text">In the centuries since AD 451, when the question was supposedly settled, Christians have often remained reluctant to accept Jesus’ full humanity, and have developed all sorts of ways, some of them more blatant, some of them more subtle, of holding up a picture of Jesus that is not <span class="italic">quite</span> human. As an example of the more subtle versions of such thinking, consider the quite unscriptural idea that Jesus somehow suffered in a way that was quantitatively and qualitatively different from ordinary human suffering – taking him into realms of suffering that no other human being has or could have experienced, and making him more to be pitied than any other human being before or since. In such thinking, Jesus’ suffering is turned into something other than human suffering, and so Jesus himself becomes something other than fully human. This is one accusation that has been levelled against Mel Gibson’s film, <span class="italic">The Passion of the Christ</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-110" id="footnote-169-110-backlink">110</a></span> – that it pushes the depiction of Christ’s suffering to such an extreme, beyond even that brutality needed for an accurate portrayal of the state-sponsored torture that killed him, until it becomes impossible to believe that someone who was ‘only human’ could have remained alive and conscious throughout. The film seems to suggest that Jesus’ endurance was in some sense <span class="italic">super</span>human, and so denies him full humanity.</p>

				<p class="text">Jesus is, for Christian devotion, not simply the founder of Christianity, nor simply the proclaimer of its central message, and nor is he a hero who is worthy of Christian devotion because of his superhuman ability to avoid the trials and tribulations of human life. How are Christians to think of him?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the 1440s, Piero della Francesca painted a serenely calm image of Christ’s baptism for the priory of San Giovanni in San Sepolcro, Tuscany. Like other pictures of Jesus’ baptism, this picture would have helped those who saw it to put their own baptism into a wider context: Jesus was baptized in his time and place, and now I am baptized; I in my time and place am baptized after him, thanks to him, into him.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-112" id="footnote-169-112-backlink">112</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">This specific picture, however, portrayed Jesus with striking realism, using all the techniques of Renaissance art to create the illusion of a solid, realistically physical human being. And it portrayed him as a beautiful participant in a harmonious order.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-113" id="footnote-169-113-backlink">113</a></span> Piero arranged the whole picture with mathematical precision, giving it a careful geometrical structure that held the main elements of his composition in balance (see Plate 4).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-114" id="footnote-169-114-backlink">114</a></span> Although the edges were later obscured, the painting’s overall shape originally consisted of a perfect circle centred on the dove of the Spirit, half overlapping with a perfect square that has Christ standing on its central vertical. Piero placed important vertical and horizontal elements on the lines of an evenly spaced grid, lending the whole a sense of spacious order, but superimposing over that grid diagonals that direct one’s attention and give the picture focus. A whole set of diagonals seem to converge on Christ’s hands, and the picture is cut by another line joining the only moving elements in the scene: the Baptist’s outstretched arm and the back of the man undressing ready for baptism in the background. This is a Jesus poised and balanced, standing at the harmonious centre of a beautiful order.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Aldous Huxley once wrote of Piero that ‘Even his technically religious pictures are paeans in praise of human dignity’,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-115" id="footnote-169-115-backlink">115</a></span> and in similar vein one might say that this painting is as much a picture of Renaissance humanism – that is, of the new confidence and delight in human beauty and capacity that flourished in the European Renaissance – as it is a picture of the gospel. The central figure is both Jesus Christ at one moment in the gospel story and a Renaissance everyman: a representation of an ideal, a fully fleshly yet perfectly balanced human being. It is a picture that can be set alongside other great Renaissance portrayals of human poise and possibility like Michelangelo’s famous marble sculpture of David, or the equally famous sketch by Leonardo da Vinci (‘Vitruvian Man’) of a human being set symmetrically within a square and a circle.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Piero’s painting hints at one deep current of Christian thinking about Jesus: the idea that Jesus shows us human life without the distortions and accretions that prevent it from being beautiful. The painting shows us a Jesus whose purity does not make him less than, more than, or other than human, but rather makes him <span class="italic">fully</span> human. Piero paints a physically beautiful Jesus to represent metaphorically the beauty of <span class="italic">life</span> to which all human life can and should attain.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-116" id="footnote-169-116-backlink">116</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In Christian devotion, Jesus has not simply been seen as fully human in the sense of being unreservedly embodied and unreservedly historical; he has been seen as fully human in the sense of living human life to the full, living it as it should be lived. His life has been seen as human life lifted by God to its proper height, blazing an upward trail along which all other human beings are called: humanity lifted up towards God.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Without sin</span></p>
				<p class="text">Jesus is traditionally understood to have been utterly sinless – yet though that conviction has been firm, there has been less consensus on <span class="italic">how</span> Jesus remained sinless. Some have simply said that God arranged for it to be so, and that God was free to do so: God brought it about that there was this life in the world that was without sin. Others have said that Jesus was a ‘God-intoxicated man’,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-117" id="footnote-169-117-backlink">117</a></span> who had a vision of God’s love so clearly in front of him that he simply could not desire to sin. Others have said that one can only point to the work of God’s Spirit, who leads and impels and shapes Jesus’ life. The crucial point in each case, however, is that sin is <span class="italic">not</span> understood as a proper part of being human. It may be a disease endemic in the human population, but it is not (as it were) genetic: to be human and to be sinless is not a contradiction in terms. For God to keep Jesus sinless is not to prevent him from being human; it is to free him to be <span class="italic">fully</span> human.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Gabriel Fackre writes:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The intention of the traditional concept of the perfect humanity and ‘sinlessness’ of Jesus can be expressed with the help of the imagery of vision and light. Jesus’ true and fulfilled humanity was constituted by his clear-sighted perception of, and unswerving obedience to, the vision [i.e. of God]. He saw the light and lived and moved and had his being in it. Because the light drew near to him, it so captured his gaze and orientation that it possessed him. He followed its path to the end. The tales of temptation at the opening and close of his ministry portray the persisting invitation of the powers of darkness to turn aside from the direction of light. But his commitment was undeviating, the ‘set’ of his will and behaviour arrow-straight.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-118" id="footnote-169-118-backlink">118</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">One of the ways in which Jesus has been central in Christian life has therefore been as <span class="italic">exemplar</span>: as the pattern to which Christians believe their lives should be conformed. Here is a man stripped of the vices that confine human life in destructive patterns, and filled instead with all the virtues that free and truly beautify human life. As Jesus says in John’s Gospel, ‘You call me Teacher and Lord – and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. <span class="italic">For I have set you an example</span>, that you also should do as I have done to you’ (John 13.13–15).</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Imitation of Christ</span></p>
				<p class="text">Imitation of Christ has been a recurrent motif in Christian devotion down the centuries. Perhaps most famously, it was one of the keynotes of a late medieval movement known as the <span class="italic">Devotio Moderna</span>, and found expression in that movement’s most celebrated literary work: Thomas à Kempis’s <span class="italic">The Imitation of Christ</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-119" id="footnote-169-119-backlink">119</a></span><span class="italic"> </span>– a book of astonishing popularity that has been reprinted some three thousand times since it was first written. The fascinated reaction to the book of Maggie Tulliver, the heroine of George Eliot’s novel <span class="italic">The Mill on the Floss</span>,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-120" id="footnote-169-120-backlink">120</a></span> gives some indication of how influential à Kempis’s book could still be even in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
				<p class="text">With all this, one could compare a much more recent form of devotion which, though it draws on some of the same theological ideas as the <span class="italic">Devotio Moderna</span>’s version of imitation, has grown in very different air: the late twentieth-century popularizing on bracelets, T-shirts, jewellery, bumper stickers and posters of the mnemonic <span class="italic">WWJD</span> – ‘What would Jesus do?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Is this, then, the answer to our question? Is Jesus’ centrality to Christian faith primarily the centrality of an exemplar? That is, is Jesus central to Christianity simply as the perfect embodiment of the virtues to which human beings are called, or is there more to it than that?</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-7"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jesus can be understood as the one who is ‘fully human’ in the sense of showing us human life perfected and unrestricted.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">As such Jesus can be understood as an exemplar for human life.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-8"><span class="bold">Too high a bar to jump?</span></p>
				<p class="text">Look again at Piero’s painting. Although I have been describing Piero’s Jesus as beautiful, it is a kind of beauty that leaves many viewers today cold. In the first place, this Jesus perhaps suffers from Piero’s attempts to make him an idealized figure, despite his solidity and particularity. Even though it was almost certainly painted from a particular human model, who had all the specificity and particularity that every human body has, is this is a figure who has had some of the marks of a particular history and character brushed out of his face and body in order to be made into an everyman?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the second place, we are in our society perhaps too used to being presented with images of idealized human bodies, perfectly poised and balanced, not to be suspicious of the effects of an image like Piero’s. Does this representation of a beautiful body not simply set an impossibly high bar for us to leap over, condemning us either to disgust at our own less perfect bodies or to unrelenting anxiety as we pursue the ideal?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the third place, there is the simple fact that what looked beautiful to a Tuscan painter in the middle of the fifteenth century does not necessarily look beautiful now. By painting a real, physical human being, has Piero inevitably painted someone who belongs to a specific time and place – someone who, perhaps despite Piero’s intentions, and despite what I said a moment ago, remains too solid, too located, too context-bound to be an everyman?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The three questions that Piero’s painting raises suggest questions that one might put to the current of Christian thinking that sees Christ <span class="italic">primarily</span> as exemplar, <span class="italic">primarily</span> as the model of human life lifted to God. In the first place, to claim that Jesus’ significance lies in his perfect embodiment of universal virtues comes perilously close to denying his real, full-blooded humanity. To focus our attention on the facets of Jesus’ character that could and should be emulated by anybody else is to turn away from his individual specificity – his unsubstitutable story. It is to deny, in effect, that Jesus is thoroughly particular, thoroughly embedded in his particular time and place, thoroughly shaped by his specific context, as he lives in ways appropriate to the peculiar complexes of events and opportunities among which he found himself – or at least it is to deny that any of that finally matters. To take Jesus’ significance to lie in his role as universal exemplar is to get close to enshrining a set of principles rather than a real person at the heart of Christianity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In the second place, it is easy to see how Piero’s picture could fail to be a message of good news. If Jesus is simply seen as marking the height to which one must jump, or the ideal shape to which one must reduce oneself, the message about him is likely to produce as much anxiety and despair as any impossibly thin supermodel can produce in those of us who are more amply constructed, and find dieting difficult. If Jesus is an exemplar showing the perfection of human life, he is just as likely to be heard as a word of condemnation, showing up just how far everyone else falls, and know they will go on falling, from the heights that he occupies.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Shallow Hal</span></p>
				<p class="text">The film <span class="italic">Shallow Hal</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-121" id="footnote-169-121-backlink">121</a></span> asks where true human beauty lies. The eponymous hero, played by Jack Black, is too shallow to care about the character or virtue of the women he tries to date; he cares only about idealized surface beauty. Then he meets a man who hypnotizes him, putting him into a state where he will no longer see women’s actual appearance, but will instead see as physically beautiful only those women who have beautiful personalities. Hal meets Rosemary, a vastly obese women who is ridiculed for her ugliness wherever she goes. Hal does not see this obesity, however: he sees her as beautiful  – and she is played by Gwyneth Paltrow, without a fat suit on whenever we see her through Hal’s eyes, with it whenever we see her normally.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is a fairly inconsequential film, although it does make a decent attempt to dramatize a familiar but regularly ignored piece of wisdom: you should not judge a book by its cover. The only real problem with it from a theological perspective is that the standard it sets up for <span class="italic">true</span> human beauty, while laudable in itself, could be just as disheartening, just as debilitating, as the standards of physical beauty set by supermodels and Hollywood starlets. Rosemary, and the other characters who appear beautiful to Hal, are frighteningly saintly: they are characters who have devoted themselves in extraordinary ways to the welfare of others. To live up to their worthy standard will require moral dieting every bit as impossible as the physical variety.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In the third place, the virtues displayed in the life of the young, Jewish male protagonist of the Gospels, itinerant and unmarried, are not obviously or immediately appropriate for any and every person in any and every time and place. It is simply not clear that Christian life can or should consist in ‘reading off’ from Jesus patterns of behaviour to be adopted by every one in every circumstance, from powerful rulers and police officers to battered wives and sweatshop workers. It is simply not true that he faced every situation that believers will face, and however helpful it might be to ask, ‘What would Jesus do?’, there are times when there is no obvious answer to that question, and even times when asking the question can be a way of avoiding the messy complexities and unavoidable compromises of one’s situation. If the exemplarist approach comes perilously close to ignoring Jesus’ full humanity, it also comes equally close to ignoring the full humanity – the particularity, the difference – of his Christian followers.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-10"><span class="bold">Imitation and obedience</span></p>
				<p class="text">These questions about the exemplarist tradition – that strand of Christian devotion that finds Jesus significant primarily as an example to be followed – can be sharpened if we turn to another image of Jesus, one very different from Piero’s. The Jesus Piero paints is entirely poised and balanced, entirely serene and untroubled. He displays no signs of tension, no signs of struggle or suffering; his skin is like marble, and he stands as straight as a statue. Yet the Gospels portray a Jesus who spends little time in those moments of exaltation when the story is filled with light and peace; they portray a Jesus who lives meshed in conflict, and who soon goes his way into humiliation, torture and death. We can find an image that admits more of this suffering than did Piero’s if we turn to a painting by the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina, who in around 1475 painted a picture of Christ enduring his flogging.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">One of the first Italian painters to work with oil glazes, Antonello was able to use the new medium to give his pictures great depth and realism.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-122" id="footnote-169-122-backlink">122</a></span> Christ’s skin glows with warm light, his hair falls in drooping ringlets, tears glint on his cheek. The painting breathes sadness, and everything about it is intended to awaken the viewer’s pity. It is in that sense a deeply sentimental painting – and it is a painting in which all narrative context has been stripped away: we see no Pilate, no crowd, no soldiers. We are simply directed to gaze on this sorrowful face.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Antonello’s painting is simply one example from a vast quantity of works, produced particularly from the fourteenth century onwards, that focus their attention relentlessly on the suffering of Christ the man of sorrows. By awakening the viewer’s pity, these images were supposed to awaken a sense of the awful fate that Christ had willingly suffered on one’s behalf, to nurture a desire to live so as to cause Christ no more pain, and to provide an image of the quiet resignation and sober fortitude that were to be the pattern of such life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Christ suffered uncomplainingly, the message runs, and his followers too must be willing to suffer uncomplainingly, accepting without question the fate that God throws their way. Such a strand of thinking could draw on biblical passages like Philippians 2.5–8, where Paul says, ‘Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who … emptied himself, taking the form of a slave … humbled himself, and became obedient to the point of death’. Even more strikingly, it could draw on 1 Peter 2.18–21:</p>
				<p class="quotes">18Slaves, accept the authority of your masters with all deference, not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh. 19For it is to your credit if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly. 20If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong, where is the credit in that? But if you endure when you do right and suffer for it, you have God’s approval. 21For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The dangers inherent in this approach can be seen in a nineteenth-century text that takes the argument of 1 Peter a few steps further. Christ’s suffering, it says,</p>
				<p class="quotes">is the motive which removes the love of sin: it mortifies sin by showing its turpitude to be indelible except by such an awful expiation … it excites to obedience; it purchases strength for obedience; it makes obedience practicable; it makes it acceptable; it makes it in a manner unavoidable, for it constrains to it; it is, finally, not only the motive to obedience, <span class="italic">but the pattern of it</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-123" id="footnote-169-123-backlink">123</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This may not seem too objectionable, until one realizes that it comes from an 1835 book called <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Manufactures</span>, by a man called Andrew Ure, and that he is discussing the role that Christianity can play in producing a compliant workforce suitable for factory work – part of his larger argument in praise of the factory system. In Ure’s hands, Christ as exemplar has, in effect, become Christ as taskmaster, inculcating docility and resignation among the poor, making sure that they will produce profit for their rich masters. Yet although Ure sets this out with stark clarity, he is only stating explicitly the worst implications of this wide stripe of Christian piety stretching back through Antonello da Messina and beyond, a piety that can even claim some support from 1 Peter and Philippians. Christ as exemplar, as the image of human life pleasing to God, can all too easily become a taskmaster showing believers how impossibly high they must jump – or, in this case, how impossibly low they must bow.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-11"><span class="bold">Key point</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christ as exemplar can become Christ as taskmaster, inculcating docility and resignation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-12"><span class="bold">True obedience</span></p>
				<p class="text">One can’t get away from the kind of picture painted by Ure simply by downplaying Jesus’ obedience – at least, not without downplaying the Gospels at the same time. After all, obedience even more than love is given as Jesus’ leading characteristic in the Gospels. Two aspects of that obedience, however, take us far away from Ure’s picture of a generalized, docile obedience imposed upon believers in all circumstances.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the first place, the obedience of Christ portrayed in the Gospels is very specific – a specificity still present in Philippians and (just) in 1 Peter, but stripped away by the time we get to Antonello, and positively rejected by the time we reach Ure. What do I mean by the specificity of Christ’s obedience? Well, one needs to ask both <span class="italic">to whom</span> Jesus was obedient, and <span class="italic">to what purpose</span>. In other words, the most important thing to notice is that it is not obedience as a generic virtue, but obedience specifically and only <span class="italic">to the Father</span>, <span class="italic">for the sake of the kingdom</span>. Jesus is portrayed again and again as the one who does what the Father desires, and not as the exemplar of an obedience that his followers should offer to anybody and everybody, in any circumstance. Instead, one should see Jesus’ obedience as his unstinting involvement in the divine mission to which he dedicated his life – the mission of the kingdom. Jesus obediently lives out God’s love for the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">After all, the extract I have taken from Philippians does not simply describe Jesus as humble in the abstract; its description of Jesus’ humility is part of a larger description of Jesus’ journey from the Father and to the Father. Similarly, the advice I quoted from 1 Peter is not given simply as abstract advice on how to live in any and all circumstances (though it does admittedly get close to that); it is given precisely as guidance on how to proclaim the news of God’s mission in Christ and win people to that mission when living under the conditions of the Roman Empire. And obedience to God does not automatically and unproblematically fit one for dependence on or obedience to worldly authority, whatever Andrew Ure (or 1 Peter) might say. After all, Jesus displays this obedience most clearly when he is in the process of being tortured and executed as a dissident by the authorities running his country. If Jesus’ obedience is obedience to the Father, by the same token it is obedience directed towards the Father’s kingdom of love and justice. Jesus’ self-giving is not self-giving for self-giving’s sake – self-giving in order to meet some generic ideal of humility and resignation. It is, rather, self-giving for the sake of the Kingdom: self-giving with a mission. It is the kind of self-giving that comes from being wholly caught up in a mission in the world, rather than the kind of self-giving that comes from meekly letting the world roll over you. Jesus, we might say, did not suffer torture and death because he quietly stayed at home, waiting for his society to crumble under the feet of the occupying Romans. He suffered torture and death because his ministry, his pursuit of the kingdom, challenged those in power and threatened their control.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the second place, one can note that, for Christian theology, obedience to God is not like other forms of dependence, because God is not like others. Dependence upon God is – as I will be discussing further when we come to the doctrine of creation – dependence upon one who selflessly and truly wills one’s flourishing and one’s integrity, and one who selflessly and truly wills the flourishing of the whole world of which one is a part. It is, after all, dependence upon a God who <span class="italic">is</span> love-and-justice. This God, it is claimed, does not stand over against us as another ego competing with ours, but is rather the context in which one can grow towards full life and true relationships.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In this view, dependence upon God is more like dependence upon the air one breathes than it is like dependence upon one’s driving instructor. It makes sense to say that, ideally, a person will one day become mature enough to go driving without his instructor’s help; it doesn’t make so much sense to say that, ideally, he will become mature enough to breath without oxygen’s help. There can be no sense here that obedience to God involves getting subordinated to someone else’s schemes and plans, schemes and plans (like those of the factory owner) that are all too likely to be an imposition on one’s individuality and integrity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus, Christians believe, was wholly caught up in the service of the Father’s kingdom of love and justice, agitating for that kingdom in the midst of the world. It is not that he is seen as squashing his own individuality and integrity so as to make way for God’s mission, quietly accepting God’s command as an imposition upon his life. Rather, he is portrayed as one whose whole life is caught up in and saturated by the Father’s mission; he lives it and breathes it, such that it has become his own mission. This mission is no imposition upon him: he <span class="italic">is</span> this mission.</p>

				<p class="text">Read the different versions of the Gethsemane story (Matthew 26.36–46; Mark 14.32–42; Luke 22.39–46). What kind of relationship between Jesus and the Father is suggested there? Think about your own answer before reading the following discussion by Karl Barth. Do you agree with him?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Karl Barth writes: ‘Jesus prays that this hour, this cup of wrath, might pass from him, might be spared him. He prays therefore that the good will and the sacred work and the true word of God should not coincide with the evil will and the corrupt work and the deceitful word of the tempter and of the world controlled by him. … He prays that God should not give him up to the power the temptation of which he had resisted and willed to resist in all circumstances. … Surely this is something which God cannot will and allow. Such is the prayer of Jesus as prayed once in Luke, twice in Mark, and as many as three times in Matthew. … But he only prays. He does not demand. He does not advance any claims. He does not lay upon God any conditions. He does not reserve his future obedience. … He prays only as a child to the Father knowing that he can and should pray, that his need is known to the Father, is on the heart of the Father, but knowing also that the Father disposes what is possible and will therefore be, and that what he allows to be will be the only thing that is possible and right. If we understand the beginning of Jesus’ prayer to God in this way – and how else can we understand it in view of what the texts say and in the context of the Gospels – then the meaning of what follows is clear: “But, or nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt.” (Mark 14.36; Matthew 26.39) Or more explicitly: “Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done.” (Luke 22.42) Or even more explicitly: “O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done.” (Matthew 26.42) … This is not a kind of return of willingness to obey, which was finally forced upon Jesus and fulfilled by him in the last hour; it is rather a readiness for the act of obedience which he had never compromised in his prayer. The proviso “if it be possible” which was an integral part of the prayer now comes into force. The prayer reckoned on the possibility of quite a different answer. This is what had made it a genuine prayer to God. But now this possibility fades from view. Jesus does not change his mind when he says, “Thy will be done.” After pausing with very good reason, he now proceeds all the more determinedly along the way which he had never left. … He faces the reality the avoidance of which he had so earnestly desired. Because it is the reality of the will of God he grasps it as that which is better, which alone is good. He does not do so in sad resignation, therefore, but because he will and can affirm this reality and this alone. … This is not a withdrawal on the part of Jesus, but a great and irresistible advance. It is not a resignation before God. It is an expression of the supreme and only praise which God expects of man and which is rendered to him only by this one man in place of all, the praise which comes from the knowledge that he does not make any mistakes, that his way, the way which he whose thoughts are higher than our thoughts actually treads himself, is holy and just and gracious.’</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">We are now very close to the doctrine of the incarnation. In Christian theology, Jesus’ activity is seen as, as it were, <span class="italic">transparent</span> to the Father’s will. He was, his followers claimed, so open to the will of the Father, so captivated by it, so saturated by devotion to the kingdom, that it made sense for them to speak of his acts as being the acts of God working through him. In the terms of the musical metaphor used in Chapter 2, Jesus’ commitment to the music was such that the music was playing him as much as he played it; he was so attuned to the melody that the Father was playing that he could be understood as the transcription of that divine melody for playing on a human instrument. Jesus’ obedience matters in Christian theology not because by it he shows Christians the virtue of going quietly, but because he is the Father’s kingdom of love and justice made audible; he is God’s captivating music made flesh.</p>

				<p class="text">We have moved from the claim that Jesus is a perfect example of godly life to the claim that Jesus enacts God’s life in the world. We are close to the heart of the doctrine of the incarnation already, but a few more steps in the argument are necessary.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In 1510, Matthias Grünewald painted a crucifixion scene for a monastic hospital (see Plate 5). Where Piero della Francesca’s baptism picture was built from converging symmetrical lines, this picture was built from dislocated curves; where the former has a Jesus whose white skin looks like marble, this Jesus looks as if his body is already starting to decompose. Grünewald has done everything he can to heighten the horror: Jesus’ extremities already seem to be gripped by rigor mortis; his skin is covered with bleeding wounds; his lips are grey; the cloth that wraps him is smeared and tattered; his limbs are twisted and his bones stand out, and the agony of his death is reflected in the stricken faces of the figures on the left: the two Marys and John the beloved disciple.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Although far less sentimental than Antonello da Messina’s painting, less blatantly designed to tug at the heart-strings, the focus on Christ’s passion is no less strong. There are, however, two crucial differences. Where Antonello’s painting was quite possibly designed for private contemplation, this painting was created for a very specific public context; and where Antonello’s painting stands on its own as an object of devotion, Grünewald’s is but one part of a larger sequence.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This painting was produced for the church of the Isenheim monastery at Colmar, a hospital particularly dedicated to the care of those suffering from ‘St Anthony’s fire’. An earlier writer described it:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The intestines eaten up by the force of St. Anthony’s Fire, with ravaged limbs, blackened like charcoal; either they die miserably, or they live more miserably seeing their feet and hands develop gangrene and separate from the rest of the body; and they suffer muscular spasms that deform them.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-125" id="footnote-169-125-backlink">125</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Those suffering from this disease would, at climactic moments in the year’s liturgical round, see this image of Christ, his limbs blackened, twisted and covered in sores. This is, in other words, a picture of a Jesus who has come unreservedly to share the situation of the sufferers who see it. This is Jesus being <span class="italic">in</span> the world the demonstration of God’s costly love <span class="italic">for</span> the world – a love that is utterly selfless, utterly self-giving; a love that seeks nothing for itself, but only seeks to be with the one loved, whatever the cost might be. The hospital patients could see on the cross the extreme point of the giving that Jesus had consistently demonstrated during his life. He had stepped over ritual and legal and social barriers, and the barriers created by wrongdoing and deceit, in order to eat and drink with sinners, and touch the sick and leprous. He made himself available, and allowed himself to become socially and ritually unclean, and to be tainted with the reputation of the sinners with whom he ate. The cross is of a piece with all this: Christ now stands fully on the side of broken, sinful, dying humanity, refusing in any degree to keep himself aloof. He is giving himself totally – even to the point of standing with them in separation from the Father. And in this extremity of self-giving, the suffering believer sees the self-giving of God; he sees God to be a God whose desire is for the broken world, and in whom nothing is held back from that desire. He sees a God who will step over any barriers and boundaries in order to be with the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is more to the Isenheim altarpiece than this, however. This crucifixion scene was painted on the outermost panel of an altarpiece that could open up to display other images. On certain feast days, the doors could be opened to reveal scenes of celebration and light, including a startling resurrection scene (see Plate 6) in which a white-limbed Christ glowing with golden light soars free and healed from the grave. When combined, the two pictures, crucifixion and resurrection, glow with <span class="italic">promise</span> – a promise from the Father, who is the one who raises from the dead. The self-giving of the cross is not the end in itself: it is directed towards resurrection, the raising to new, perfected life of the diseased and broken body of Jesus, and the diseased and broken body of the sufferers for whom he died. This Jesus has come to share their life so that they might share his – a ‘sweet exchange’, as the anonymous second-century <span class="italic">Epistle to Diognetus</span> puts it.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-126" id="footnote-169-126-backlink">126</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Note something else about this picture of the resurrection, though. In most of what I said in the previous section, the focus fell firmly on what Christ <span class="italic">did</span> – his intentions, his activity, his deliberate carrying into effect of the Father’s mission. In painting the resurrection, however, Grünewald is painting a Jesus who is alive and active, but not as the consequence of his own action. Jesus is raised from the dead by the Father, not by his own will or ability. The action portrayed in this picture is the Father’s, even though the Father does not directly appear. And that fact might send us back to the crucifixion image with a new thought. This is a picture of Jesus’ self-giving, certainly, but it is also a picture of Jesus as himself a gift, given to the suffering patients by God. Recall, after all, that this is an altarpiece, and would have been seen during celebrations of the Eucharist: the patients in this hospital would have seen a Jesus who had come to share their condition just at the moment that they received his body and blood as a gift from the hands of the priest.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The claim of orthodox Christian theology is not simply that Jesus’ action was so obedient to the Father as to be transparent to the Father’s will. The claim of orthodox Christian theology is not simply that by his obedient action Jesus shows the world the heart of the Father. Rather, the claim of orthodox Christian theology is that the entirety of Jesus’ fully human life, lived out from birth to resurrection in a specific time and place, is a gift from God. This life <span class="italic">is </span>God’s activity on the world’s behalf, it <span class="italic">is </span>a creative word spoken by God to the world, bringing about the world’s salvation. Jesus is, Christians say, the hand of God reached down into the midst of history, into the world of human beings and their plight, grasping hold not just of the Isenheim lepers in the midst of their suffering, but all of humanity, in order to raise them up with Christ to new life – the life of the resurrection, the life of glory, the life of perfected love and justice that is the life of God. Jesus is, in Christian theology, God’s way of loving the world.</p>

				<p class="text">The stories of Jesus in the Gospels are not stories of his <span class="italic">achievements</span>. They do not show the process by which he became virtuous, or show him fighting to overcome all that might have held him back. He is faced with temptations, certainly – but there is no hint that he must struggle to overcome them. Only in Gethsemane do we see a brief glimpse of such struggle. In the Gospels, Jesus is already the man (or baby) of God when he first appears. He does not so much show believers how to reach God, as show how God has reached them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Contrast this with Nikos Kazantzakis’s novel <span class="italic">The Last Temptation of Christ</span>, and Martin Scorsese’s film adaptation. The film opens with a quotation from the prologue to the novel scrolling up the screen:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The dual substance of Christ – the yearning, so human, so superhuman, of man to attain to God or, more exactly, to return to God and identify himself with him – has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me. This nostalgia for God, at once so mysterious and so real, has opened in me large wounds and also large flowing springs.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">My principal anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows from my youth onward has been the incessant, merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh … and my soul is the arena where these two armies have clashed and met.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-127" id="footnote-169-127-backlink">127</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Kazantzakis carries on, later in the Prologue,</p>
				<p class="quotes">Struggle between the flesh and the spirit, rebellion and resistance, reconciliation and submission, and finally – the supreme purpose of the struggle – union with God: this was the ascent taken by Christ, the ascent which he invites us to take as well, following his bloody tracks. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">If we are to be able to follow him we must have a profound knowledge of his conflict, we must relive his anguish: his victory over the blossoming snares of the earth, his sacrifice of the great and small joys of men and his ascent from sacrifice to sacrifice, exploit to exploit, to martyrdom’s summit, the Cross.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-128" id="footnote-169-128-backlink">128</a></span></p>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jesus, by sharing the lot of suffering humanity, is held to demonstrate the Father’s love for the world.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jesus shares this mortal life so that they might share his risen life.</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-16"><span class="bold">The heart of the doctrine</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">It is time to take stock of the claims about Jesus that I have been exploring in this chapter (and to some extent in the previous chapter as well). I began with the claim that Jesus of Nazareth is unreservedly and unadulteratedly human. That is, he is not human with some inhuman powers or faculties added on, nor human but with some ordinary feature or limitation of human life missing. He lived an utterly finite, utterly creaturely life, a biological and cultural existence as a human being defined by nature and by nurture, utterly embroiled in a particular history, desiring, learning and suffering.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet, Christians claim, to encounter this human being is to encounter the love of God. In the first place, Jesus is portrayed in the Gospels as the <span class="italic">proclaimer </span>of God’s love: he gives himself over to the proclamation of the Father’s kingdom of love and justice. In the second place, he does not simply proclaim this love, he <span class="italic">shows </span>it. He puts his money where his mouth is. In the third place, however, Jesus’ commitment to the kingdom is such that it has taken over his life: <span class="italic">it</span> acts through <span class="italic">him</span>. As I put it earlier, his obedience is such that we may say of his acts that they are the Father’s acts, acting through him. The Father’s kingdom flows in his veins; he is himself an outpost of that kingdom.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is this captivation by the kingdom that enables Christians to say that Jesus was fully human in a second sense: he shows them human life as it should be, united to God, caught up in God’s life. He shows that although sin may be endemic among human beings, it is not a necessary part of being human. Human beings properly belong in the stream of this divine life, and to be sinners is to live like fish out of water. Where we flounder, Jesus swims.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is even more to Jesus’ relationship to the kingdom than this, however. Christian theology claims that Jesus is <span class="italic">the Father’s way of loving the world</span>. That is, he is not simply an example (or <span class="italic">the </span>example) of kingdom life; he is not simply an ambassador for the kingdom. He is what the Father is doing to establish the kingdom: he is the kingdom’s foundation. Whilst it might make sense to say that all human beings are called to full humanity, and so to be where Christ is, fully immersed in the flow of God’s life, this further claim about Jesus is one that is made about him alone. Jesus is the lynchpin of the economy of salvation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">God gives this human life to the world: bringing this life into being, and by the Holy Spirit impelling, animating and driving it, from conception on, to take the shape that it does. And God does so because this human life is God’s way of setting the world on fire, of rekindling it to glory. God gives this fully human life to the world, in order to give God’s own life to the world. This is the central claim of the Christian doctrine of incarnation.</p>

The doctrine of Christ’s person treats of his humanity and divinity. The doctrine of Christ’s work treats of his achievement of humanity’s salvation. Yet to speak of incarnation – the doctrine of Christ’s person – is to speak of what God is doing by means of this human life – the doctrine of Christ’s work, and the distinction should never be allowed to become a separation.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-18"><span class="bold">A place in the Son</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">In Chapter 4, I argued that for Trinitarian theology knowing God is a matter of participation in the threefold economy. God is what Christians know, the life in which they participate, the life that makes itself at home in them, as they are drawn into this economy. I argued that it made sense to say that the immanent life of God that is known in this economy is, in some sense, one substance in three hypostases, and that the threefold economy is the opening up for creatures of this triune immanent life. Within that Trinitarian scheme, Jesus is seen specifically as the coming to the world, the self-revelation, of the second hypostasis of God’s triune life, the hypostasis we name (for Jesus’ sake) as the eternal Son.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This may sound like it says something rather different from what I have been saying in this chapter so far. After all, in this chapter I have been claiming that Jesus shows us the <span class="italic">Father</span>, and that Jesus is what the <span class="italic">Father </span>is doing. Yet in the last chapter, I said that Jesus shows us the <span class="italic">Son</span>, and that Jesus is what the <span class="italic">Son </span>is doing.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The difference is only apparent, however. These are really different ways of saying the same thing. After all, in a Trinitarian perspective, to know God is to be drawn into that love and justice that has its fount and origin in the Father; it is to be drawn into that love and justice that is formed within one in the power of the Spirit; and it is to be drawn into that love and justice that one recognizes in Jesus and is conformed to by being conformed to him.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The specific role Jesus plays in the whole drama of the threefold economy is therefore that of the one who makes the love of God, the love that comes from the Father, visible and shareable – the one in whom it is put in terms in which it can be imprinted upon a human life. The Spirit may press me into the mould, and the shape I take on may be one that responds to the Father – but the mould is Jesus. Jesus is the one in whom the life of God, the life that flows from the Father, becomes visible.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So while I used the word ‘incarnation’ loosely of the process by which the whole immanent Trinity shows itself in the threefold economy, it is a word that is more properly used of Jesus alone. Jesus is, by the Spirit, the <span class="italic">visibility </span>of the love that unites the Trinity; Jesus is that triune love made <span class="italic">flesh</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">In order to make the connection between Trinity and Incarnation more graspable, we have to risk a journey into more deeply imaginative language about the immanent life of God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-130" id="footnote-169-130-backlink">130</a></span> The eternal Father, we might say, lives a life of eternal self-giving love. That is, we can imagine the Father always and eternally being a source-giving-rise-to-an-other. Early Christian theologians compared this to a spring of water. You can’t have a spring that at some later point produces a stream; rather, as soon as you have a spring you have a stream. The stream depends on the spring, certainly, but the spring never exists without the stream – the stream does not come ‘after’ the spring in any temporal sense. So it is with the Father. The Father eternally pours himself out, and never exists without the one who is poured out: the Son.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-131" id="footnote-169-131-backlink">131</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The Father’s life of self-giving love is played again in the Son. The Son is a repetition of the Father’s life, but the Son’s life is, as it were, a variation on the Father’s theme, because that life of self-giving love does not, in the Son, take the form of absolute source, but of a response. In the Son, the life of eternal self-giving love is a giving-<span class="italic">back</span>; the Son eternally pours himself out in obedience and delight in the Father who gives him his being.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Fountain and stream</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘When we speak of God the Father and God the Son, we do not speak of them as different, nor do we separate each: because the Father cannot exist without the Son, nor can the Son be separated from the Father, since the name of Father cannot be given without the Son, nor can the Son be begotten without the Father. Since, therefore, the Father makes the Son, and the Son the Father, they both have one mind, one spirit, one substance; but the former is as it were an overflowing fountain, the latter as a stream flowing forth from it: the former as the sun, the latter as it were a ray extended from the sun. And since he is both faithful to the most high Father, and beloved by him, he is not separated from him; just as the stream is not separated from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun: for the water of the fountain is in the stream, and the light of the sun is in the ray.’</p>
				<p class="source">Lactantius, <span class="italic">Divine Institutes</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-132" id="footnote-169-132-backlink">132</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Now, it is this second form of the life of God, this eternal Son, playing the Father’s life back to him, that comes to the world in Jesus of Nazareth. And that is not accidental: this is the form of God’s life that is apt for incarnation, for being shown in the life of a creature, because creaturely life is itself necessarily dependent and responsive; to be a creature is not to be an absolute source. The Son’s responsive, dependent form of the one life of God is apt for incarnation in a way that the Father’s life on its own could not be.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So Trinitarian theologians have said that it is only <span class="italic">because</span> God’s eternal, immanent life already contains this second, responsive form, that the incarnation of God is possible. God is free to become incarnate because, and only because, God is triune. In fact, Trinitarian theologians have gone further. It is only <span class="italic">because</span> God is Triune, only <span class="italic">because</span> God’s immanent life also involves this second, responsive form, that the idea of any creaturely participation in the life of God makes sense. And so it is only because God is Triune that we can think that God created the world for participation in God’s life. And since (as we will be discussing in Chapter 7) that is what creation <span class="italic">is</span>, for Trinitarian theology, the existence of the eternal Son in the life of God is a necessary condition for God creating the world. It is only because God is Triune, only because God’s eternal life contains this second, responsive form, that God is free to create, free <span class="italic">for</span> creation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, Trinitarian theologians say, the Son’s place in the eternal life of God is the place that is held open for the world. It is the space in the life of God marked out for the participation of God’s creatures: it is God’s freedom for the world. And, speculative and imaginative though this discussion has been, one must say something like it if one wants to say that human beings conformed to Jesus by the Spirit, facing the Father and facing the world with the Father’s love, are being drawn into the life of God, and made participants in the circulation of God’s life.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-19"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jesus is the visibility of God’s life in the world.</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-10-20"><span class="bold">The hypostatic union</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">According to Trinitarian theology, the eternal Son is one hypostasis, one ‘something’ of the eternal life of God: the Son is part of what it is and always has been to be God. This Son is and always has been fully divine, possessing a fully divine nature; the Son is and always has been an essential dimension of the divine substance. The eternal Son is, as the Nicene Creed says, ‘of one substance’ (Greek: <span class="italic">homoousios</span>) with the Father.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus is the <span class="italic">dramatis persona </span>in the economy in and by which this aspect of God, the eternal Son, becomes visible and tangible in the world. We might say, imaginatively, that the eternal Son, while remaining everything that he has eternally been, has taken on in Jesus a new way of acting and appearing. God has created in the world a fully human life that will display in the world the life of the Son – the self-giving love and justice of God in its responsive form. To use the classical terminology, we can say that the Son has ‘assumed’ a fully human nature.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What the Son has assumed is a full human nature, not just some human qualities. That is, what God has created in the world is a complete human being – with a human body, a human mind, a human soul, a human spirit, a human will, human consciousness, human memory, finite and frail, bodily and limited. But this human life is <span class="italic">the Son’s </span>human life. Precisely because of the nature of the Son – as the one in whom the one life of God is played in responsive, dependent form – this human being is an instrument on which the eternal Son’s life can be played.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The claim is not that the infinite, unlimited and eternal Son ‘turned into’ the finite, limited and creaturely human person Jesus. What would that mean? Nor is the claim that the eternal Son and the human Jesus share a mind, or a will, or a soul, or anything, so as to make up one composite personality. Nor is the claim that Jesus is a human personality made up from some human parts and some divine parts. What would any of that mean? If we said anything like that, we’d start calling into question the real, ordinary humanity of Jesus pretty quickly.</p>

This is to misunderstand both incarnation and the virgin birth. The virgin birth depicted in the New Testament, and any historical reality to which those texts refer, is a <span class="italic">sign</span>: it communicates something about Jesus (that his whole life is a gift from God) rather than being the mechanism by which that something is ensured. The same is true with other miracles associated with Jesus. They are not <span class="italic">proofs</span> of his divinity, because his divinity does not consist in him having some extra, superhuman, miracle-working power; they are signs that God is, through Jesus (as through his disciples) working for the salvation of the world.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">To say that this human life is the <span class="italic">Son’s</span> human life is to say that this Jesus shows one the life of the Son, and so the whole life of God – opening that life for one’s participation. This is the way that the eternal Son gives himself, unreservedly and completely: transcribing for a creaturely instrument the whole life of God in Sonly form. And to say that this human life is the Son’s human life is to say that Jesus, as it were, has no existence outside this showing: this is what he was brought into being for. This utterly defines who and what he is. To know Jesus <span class="italic">is</span> to know the Son, and to know the Son <span class="italic">is</span> to know the life of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So Jesus is the eternal Son’s humanity: his life, his sufferings, his death, his resurrection are the eternal Son’s life, sufferings, death and resurrection. And the eternal Son’s life, love and justice are Jesus’ life, love and justice. In a sense, the Son <span class="italic">is</span> Jesus; Jesus <span class="italic">is</span> the Son. This human being or human nature, Jesus of Nazareth, and the eternal Son who has a divine nature, are not two, they are one: they are united in one <span class="italic">hypostasis</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Think of a portrait painted in oils. The painting is entirely made of canvas and paint. There is absolutely nothing there other than canvas and paint: one could scrutinize every millimetre of the painting, use any instrument one liked, and one would find only canvas and paint. And yet the painting is a painting <span class="italic">of</span> someone; it is a portrait. What is this? Paint and canvas? Yes, but look again: what is this? It is a smiling face. <span class="italic">Who</span> is it? It is the artist, because this is a self-portrait.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The ‘what’ questions are nature questions, and (rather clumsily) my answers could be rephrased to say that this portrait has a painty nature and a facey nature. The ‘who’ question is the hypostasis question: Who do you see? Who meets you here? Who acts upon you here? The artist–sitter, who gives herself to me in this way.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">So it is with Jesus of Nazareth. There is nothing there other than a human life: he is utterly human, unreservedly and unadulteratedly human. No amount of scraping away at his surface will uncover anything other than a human being. And yet according to incarnational Christianity this human being is a portrait of the eternal Son, and in it we see the divine life. What is this? It is a human being: a fully human nature. Yes, but look again: what is this? It is the divine life of love and justice – it is the divine nature. So <span class="italic">who</span> is it? It is God, the eternal Son; it is his self-portrait, and he gives himself to the world in this way.</p>

				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">What is it to believe in the incarnation? It is not a matter of being adept at mental gymnastics, juggling natures while balancing on hypostases. All of that is <span class="italic">commentary</span> upon belief in the incarnation. Belief in the incarnation itself is the belief that the human life of Jesus of Nazareth is God’s gift to the whole world, God’s word to the whole world – and to oneself. It is the belief that in the life Jesus lived in his specific time and place, the heart of God, the creator and fulfiller of the whole world was exposed. And so, at its simplest, belief in the incarnation is the determination to ‘take every thought captive to Christ’ (2 Corinthians 10.5), because belief in the incarnation is the belief that this particular human reality is of universal significance. To believe in the incarnation is to live the conviction that it is in relation to this man that any and all things will become who they were made to be. To believe in the incarnation is to allow constantly renewed attention to Jesus to rearrange and transform every and any area of one’s life, and every and any aspect of one’s world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus of Nazareth is a human being, not a set of ideas or principles. One cannot summarize a human being. Any attempt to state in general terms <span class="italic">what</span> the implications are of following Jesus can only be a secondary commentary, sketching the barest outline of a reality that will inevitably be much more thoroughly particular. Nevertheless, to give an indication of the kind of rearrangement and transformation that Jesus brings, we may say that to believe in the incarnation is to learn to recognize oneself as the object of the same unsettling love that this man showed to his disciples, to the sinners in Israel, to the lepers in Isenheim – and to recognize oneself as called to the same love. And it is to learn to recognize the world as loved by the same love, and called to the same love. Belief in the incarnation therefore means learning to recognize all those around one as people for whom God has given God’s life; it means learning to recognize that there is no context in which the call to Christlike love and justice is inappropriate or irrelevant. To use Jesus’ own summary, we may say that to believe in the incarnation is to declare one’s allegiance to the kingdom of love and justice, and to live as its subject.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">There are so many critical questions surrounding the doctrine of the Incarnation that it is hard to know where to begin. One idea that generated a lot of heat during the late 1970s and 1980s, and still spits and fizzes today, is the question of ‘myth’. What kind of language is the doctrine of the incarnation meant to be? Is it, perhaps, best thought of as ‘myth’: not in the popular sense of the word, simply meaning ‘false’, but in the sense that important truths are being conveyed in a pictorial guise? The papers in John Hick  (ed.), <span class="italic">The Myth of God Incarnate</span> (London: SCM Press, 1977) discuss all this at some length. You can also look at some of the replies: Michael Green (ed.), <span class="italic">The Truth of God Incarnate</span> (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1977); Michael Goulder (ed.), <span class="italic">Incarnation and Myth</span> (London: SCM Press, 1979); and A.

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Another question that has been raised is about the maleness of Jesus. If this male human being shows us God’s life, doesn’t that directly or subliminally lead us to think of God in male terms? The question is posed forcefully by Rosemary Radford Ruether, <span class="italic">Sexism and God-Talk: Toward A Feminist Theology</span> (Boston: Beacon, 1983), chapter 5. You can find interesting answers in Sandra Schneiders, <span class="italic">Women and the Word: The Gender of God in the New Testament and the Spirituality of Women</span> (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist, 1986); and Richard Bauckham and Rowan Williams, ‘Jesus: God with us’ in Christina Baxter (ed.), <span class="italic">Stepping Stones: Joint Essays on Anglican, Catholic and Evangelical Unity</span> (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1987): pp. 21–41.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The presentation of the doctrine of the incarnation often proceeds by way of an enumeration of <span class="italic">heresies</span> – views of Christ that were excluded as erroneous as the orthodox view developed. Find a good theological dictionary or encyclopaedia, and look up the following: <span class="italic">docetism</span>, <span class="italic">ebionitism</span>, <span class="italic">adoptionism</span>, <span class="italic">Arianism</span>, <span class="italic">Nestorianism</span>, <span class="italic">Apollinarianism</span>, <span class="italic">Eutychianism</span>, <span class="italic">monophysitism</span> and <span class="italic">monothelitism</span> – and see if you can work out how they relate to the Christology I have been explaining. For some of these, see Ben Quash and Michael Ward (eds), <span class="italic">Heresies and How to Avoid Them: Why it Matters What Christians Believe</span> (London: SPCK, 2007); for heresy more generally, see G. R. Evans, <span class="italic">A Brief History of Heresy</span>, Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion (Oxford: Blackwell, 2003).</li>

See Ioannes Bollandus et al. (eds), <span class="italic">Acta Sanctorum: Februarii</span>, vol. 1 (Antwerp: Ioannem Meursium, 1658), pp. 449–57, available online at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6027x/f1.chemindefer). The legend associating her with an image of Christ perhaps arose because a connection was made between her name (which is actually a Latinized form of <span class="italic">Berenike</span>, Berenice) and the words <span class="italic">vera icon</span>, ‘true image’.</p>
