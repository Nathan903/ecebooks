				<p class="Chapter-start" id="toc_marker-11"><a id="x6.-The-Enlivening-Spirit"/>6. The Enlivening Spirit</p>
				<p class="text">In Chapters 2 and 4, I argued that Christians can make sense of their lives, individually and corporately, as journeys into the life of God – or, more specifically, as threefold journeys into the triune life of God. By participating in the economy of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Trinitarian Christians believe that they are drawn into the immanent heart of God. In Chapter 5, I dwelt on the place of Jesus in this economy; in this chapter, I turn to the role of the Spirit. I have already said a fair amount about the Spirit. I introduced the Spirit as the power of God that enabled and impelled Jesus’ ministry, and as the power promised to the disciples to enable and impel their discipleship. I spoke of the Spirit drawing people into the kingdom of God, making that kingdom a reality in history, and I spoke of the Spirit drawing people to Jesus. In this chapter, I will look more directly and exclusively at the nature and work of the Spirit, taking into account a wider range of biblical materials, as well as taking a glance at some of the claims made for the Spirit in more recent times. The technical term for this chapter’s subject matter, then, is <span class="italic">Pneumatology</span>: the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">show that in the Old Testament the Spirit is one name given to the life-giving, community-shaping, justice-building power of God;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that in the New Testament the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the life of God, which is love and justice;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">claim that there can be, for Christian theology, no sphere of ‘spirituality’ separable from the practices and processes by which common life is formed and by which the powers of injustice are challenged;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that the Spirit’s work is to shape people until they become gifts to one another, giving more of Christ to one another.</li>

				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Preparation</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Classical Christian doctrine claims that the Holy Spirit of God is living and active, working in the world and among God’s people in mysterious, invisible ways. But who or what is the Spirit, according to Christianity? What does the Spirit do, and how? Jot down now a paragraph for yourself in which you try to answer those questions.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">‘Spirit’ is a word that is used in many ways. If you have internet access, you can see Google’s list of online definitions at http://www.google.com/search?q=define:spirit; other online definitions are available at http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=spirit. Look at some of these definitions now. How many of them do you think are relevant or appropriate when our topic is the Holy Spirit? Are any of the relevant definitions that you have found particularly helpful, or particularly unhelpful?</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Additional reading</span></p>
				<p class="text">Less has been written about the Spirit than about the Trinity or about Christology, but as an accompaniment to this chapter, I would recommend:</p>
				<p class="references">Eugene F. Rogers, Jr, <span class="italic">After the Spirit: A Constructive Pneumatology from Resources Outside the Modern West</span> (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2005). Skip straight to Part II for a wonderful description of the Spirit’s roles in the economy of salvation.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-1"><span class="bold">The Spirit in the Old Testament</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In Chapter 4, I introduced the Spirit with the following words:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The Spirit is portrayed in the Gospels as that power of God that enables and impels Jesus’ ministry, and as the power that is promised to Jesus’ disciples to enable and impel them to respond to Jesus’ proclamation of the Father’s kingdom. The Spirit is the one who makes the kingdom of God, the kingdom of love and justice, real in Jesus’ life and in the life of Jesus’ followers; we might think of the Spirit as the Spirit <span class="italic">of </span>this kingdom.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">This may have reinforced the common but quite false idea that reference to the Spirit is fundamentally a <span class="italic">New Testament</span> phenomenon – one of those additions that early Christians made to the idea of God they inherited from Judaism. It is fitting, then, to begin our more detailed discussion of the Spirit with a careful look at resources from the Old Testament.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">If you have worked your way through the list suggested in the Exercise, you will have looked up very nearly all the references to the Spirit of God or Holy Spirit in the Old Testament. The word ‘spirit’ gets used in a variety of ways, and I have only listed those where talk about the Spirit seems to be a way of talking about God’s activity or involvement in the world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-134" id="footnote-169-134-backlink">134</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Very roughly, the texts divide up into three broad categories:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">there are texts that deal with the whole of creation, or all living things;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">there are texts that deal with God’s relationship to particular individuals; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">there are texts that deal with God’s relationship with the people of Israel.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-line-above">That is over-neat – there are plenty of texts that do not quite fit into that way of dividing things up – but it is a start, at least.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">The Spirit and creation</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">The Spirit of God hovers over the waters of creation in Genesis 1.2; we are told that if God were to remove his Spirit, life would cease (in Genesis 6.3, frequently in Job, in Psalm 104.30 and elsewhere in the Psalter, and so on). God <span class="italic">breathes </span>life and vitality into creation, and the breath God gives, the Spirit God breathes into creatures, becomes their life, their breath. When it departs, they return to dust. The Spirit is God’s sustaining presence, holding creation in being, but more particularly the Spirit is God’s <span class="italic">life</span>-giving activity, working to animate creation from within, giving creation its own life and dynamism.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">The Spirit and individuals</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">I have divided these texts into seven very rough categories.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Bezalel son of Uri in Exodus 31.3 is filled with the Spirit and given various kinds of practical skill, with the Spirit seen perhaps as the source of his excellence, his dexterity – at least insofar as his skill becomes available for adorning the Tabernacle.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit enables people to interpret dreams (as in Genesis 41.38 and throughout Daniel), and there is perhaps a little of the previous idea here, of the Spirit providing and enhancing a skill, but also a sense of being given extraordinary piercing insight: seeing truly, in a way that human beings cannot normally do.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit catches individuals up into ecstatic fervour, removing them from the ordinary run of life and sense, and placing them on the edge of things as living markers of God’s strangeness and power. See, for instance, several of the texts in 1 Samuel.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit is portrayed as one who ‘catches people up’ in a rather different sense: there are several texts in 1 Kings and in Ezekiel where the Spirit seems to be Elijah’s or Ezekiel’s personal teleport system, albeit one over which they have little control. The Spirit breaks in to the ordinary continuities, the ordinary predictability of life, in service of a more mysterious, less containable purpose.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit raises individuals up as powerful leaders, fighting for the liberation of the people of Israel, as repeatedly in Judges. The Spirit erupts in an individual in order for them to overthrow the oppressors.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit equips individuals to be leaders in a more peaceful sense, giving them the wisdom and the discernment that is needed, particularly for judging (for ensuring justice, for ruling justly); see, for instance, Deuteronomy 34.9, Daniel 6.3. That is linked to the sense of ‘anointing’, where an individual is given as it were the right to rule, but only insofar as he rules in obedience to God’s just law (not as the kings of the Gentiles rule, who think they are their own masters).</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Lastly, the Spirit enables individuals to speak the word of God in a given situation: the word that will pierce the veils of convention and half-truth, and will show right as right, and wrong as wrong; the word that will bait unjust rulers, and condemn idolaters.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-line-above">It seems to me that there are two sides to what the Spirit is said to do here. On the one hand, there is the Spirit as God’s upholding of just and proper order: the Spirit who enables individuals to contribute to the building of well-ordered life, whether it be in the quite literal sense in which Bezalel builds, or in the more metaphorical sense in which a wise ruler builds. The Spirit, we might say, is a Spirit of Wisdom.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Set alongside that, however, is a picture of the Spirit as God’s disruptive interference, who takes the sensible and throws them into prophetic frenzy; who raises up angular prophets to bellow from the sidelines and judges to wage wars of liberation; who challenges the unjust order of things, and names idols for what they are. This is the Spirit, we might say, of Judgement.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">By this Spirit, men and women of God <span class="italic">become </span>men and women of God both by learning (being built up in wisdom, being shaped into a just ordering of life) and unlearning (repeatedly having their idolatries exposed and challenged, their distortions and betrayals of the truth named and condemned). The Spirit is the agency of God animating and directing this process – nurturing justice and wisdom among the people, coaxing it from their existing resources, but also bringing the people up against what is beyond their resources, what exceeds and judges them, and calls them to new life.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">The Spirit and Israel</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Alongside references to the Spirit that focus on creation, and references that focus on individuals, there are also references that focus on the people of Israel as a whole. I find three rough categories here.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">There are a few texts (such as Isaiah 63.11) where just as an individual creature is understood to be alive only so long as it has God’s Spirit within it, so Israel is understood to have God’s Spirit within her, to be animated by that Spirit – and to be in mortal danger when she loses that Spirit. The Spirit sustains, animates and enlivens the people as a whole.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Then there are texts in which the Spirit is spoken of as the leader and teacher of the people (Nehemiah 9.20 and 30, for instance) – and even if that leading and teaching is carried out by means of individual prophets, it is the people who are the true object of the Spirit’s action.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">And then there are also texts that focus on the future: on the Spirit as the one who will enliven the people, and who will lead them, on the Day of the Lord, into true flourishing (as in Isaiah 44.3 and elsewhere). This hope appears to be, on the one hand, for the people to become a people who are themselves filled with the Spirit – as, perhaps most famously, in Joel 2.28, where there is the vision of everyone becoming a prophet. On the other hand, it is a hope for God to raise up a great spirit-anointed leader (as in Isaiah 11.2): someone who will be the completion and perfection of the spirit-enabled wise rulers and builders of the past.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Here again, in other words, we see the Spirit spoken of both as the source of what well-ordered life the people do now have – as their sustainer, guide and teacher – and as the one who will bring them the life that they do not yet have, indeed a life which is simply not in their power to create for themselves, but which will come to them as the gracious gift of God.</p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">We may perhaps summarize all of this – the references that have to do with creation, those that have to do with individuals, and those that have to do with Israel as a whole – by saying that the Spirit is the power of God for life. The Spirit is God animating all life and leading creatures towards well-ordered, just and flourishing life – by drawing out and nurturing natural skills and sense, certainly, but also by erupting against idolatry and oppression, raising up individuals and forming communities that will name and resist distortions of true life. The Spirit animates life from within, not in a static way (not simply flicking a switch which turns the whole animated display of life on) but rather in a dynamic and purposeful way, leading life on and pointing it to the perfection it has not yet reached, and which it so frequently denies.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the Old Testament, then, God is sometimes described as acting by means of God’s ‘Spirit’: an enlivening force at work in creation, in individuals, and in Israel. Little or nothing is said about what kind of reality the Spirit is – little or nothing, for instance, about how distinct the Spirit is from God – but a great deal is said about what the Spirit <span class="italic">does</span>. The Spirit is simply the name that Old Testament authors find for that power of God invisible and active among them, drawing them back to God from idolatry and oppression, and on into God’s just future.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-2"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">In the Old Testament, God is sometimes described as acting by means of God’s ‘Spirit’.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit is the power that sustains, animates and enlivens all life.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit is the power that draws out and nurtures skills, wisdom and justice.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit is the power that erupts against idolatry, injustice and oppression.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-3"><span class="bold">The Spirit in Acts</span></p>
				<p class="text">I have already in Chapter 4, pages 79–80, discussed the Spirit’s appearances in the Gospels and in some other parts of the New Testament, and I don’t plan on repeating that material here. However, I did not cover any of the appearances of the Spirit in the Book of Acts, despite the fact that the Spirit is one of that book’s central characters.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">When the Spirit is spoken of in Acts, some at least of the Old Testament portrayal that we have been exploring lies in the background, perhaps most often the hope that on the Day of the Lord the Spirit will enliven and lead the people into true flourishing life, and the hope that the Spirit will anoint a leader who will be the completion and perfection of the spirit-enabled wise rulers and builders of the past.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In Acts 2, for instance, Peter is portrayed explaining to the astonished crowds just what has happened to the disciples upon whom the ecstasy of the Spirit has fallen. He draws on a prophecy from Joel concerning the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of the Lord (Acts 2.16–21), and goes on, with the help of a quotation from Psalm 16 (Acts 2.25–28) to claim that this Spirit has been poured out upon them at the hands of Jesus, the anointed one, the Messiah or Christ. Ideas about God’s Spirit drawn from the Old Testament are refocused by being referred to Jesus.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We have already seen that Jesus is portrayed in the Gospels as shaped and directed by the Spirit, that is, as one on whom the Spirit rests; but Peter’s explanation that the Spirit has been poured out at the hands of Jesus points back to the claim made by John the Baptist at the start of each of the Gospels that Jesus will ‘baptize you with the Holy Spirit’ (Matthew 3.11; Mark 1.8; Luke 3.16; John 1.33) – that the one on whom the Spirit rests will pour out this Spirit onto others. In Acts, the Church is presented as the community of those on whom the Spirit has been poured out at Jesus’ hand, and initiation into that community is presented as a matter of receiving this Holy Spirit in Jesus’ name.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The community of Christ’s followers is understood in Acts to be the community of the Spirit – the community drawn together by, filled with and impelled by the Spirit. And that Spirit is the same Spirit who rested upon Jesus, and the same Spirit of life, truth and justice who animated and guided the people of Israel.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-4"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">In Acts, Jesus is the one who pours out or baptizes with the Spirit, as well as being the one on whom the Spirit rests.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">This claim has for its background Jewish hope for the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of the Lord.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-5"><span class="bold">The Spirit in Paul and John</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">There are two main locations of discussion of the Spirit in the New Testament that we still have to consider: the Pauline Epistles and the Gospel of John. However, rather than trying to cover them in a quick survey, like the one I have been pursuing so far, I am going to examine three texts in detail.</p>
				<p class="quotes">11If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">12So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh – 13for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. 15For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’ 16it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ – if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">18I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us. 19For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; 20for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 21that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 22We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; 23and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. 24For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? 25But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">26Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. 27And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">28We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">The resurrected Christ is, in this passage, the forerunner, the trailblazer – one who has been raised to life in God by God’s Spirit, and who therefore shows Christians the way that they are going to follow. In him they see where they are headed: not to the abandonment of their bodies, but to full bodily life, real life, life in God. The power of the Spirit is the power that draws them towards that future, and makes it real to them now. The Spirit is the power of that future already living in them, holding in its hands the transformed people that they will one day be. The Spirit worked this transformation in Jesus and so can be seen as a pledge of the same transformation for others. Believers can now, if they choose, live according to the flesh, ignoring this pledge of the future, ignoring the directedness of their lives towards their future in God. Or they can live ‘according to the Spirit’. That is, they can live in anticipation of this future, living here and now in the light of what they will one day become.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And what the Spirit tells them they will become is heirs of God: full, grown-up children, sharing unrestrictedly in the life of God’s family, adopted alongside Christ as God’s children, and so having the future alongside Christ and with the Father to look forward to. When Christians call upon God as Father, they are living according to their adoption, and living according to the future they have as full heirs in this family. So, whenever Christians acknowledge God as Father, whenever they grasp what God is doing with them and for them, drawing them to himself as his children, that simply <span class="italic">is </span>the work of the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">At the moment, however, that reality is hidden. It is hidden in believers’ weakness, and in a world like ours it takes the form of suffering, just as it did with Jesus: dying to distorted and broken ways of living, living against the grain of a world committed to selfishness and violence. Believers groan under this, but wait with patience for the time when God by God’s Spirit will make the true order of things visible. They can live in the sure knowledge that the Spirit now holds up to God the image of what they shall be in that future, so that God looks at them and sees what they will become, not simply what they currently are.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">This salvation for which Christians wait is, however, also the salvation of creation. Paul’s picture seems to be something like this: creation is, in its current state, futile: it is missing its proper fulfilment; it is a knife with an unsharpened blade. But it will receive its fulfilment alongside, or in, or through, the revelation in its midst of children of God. It is as if God had not yet finished creating the world, because between the penultimate stage of his creating work (the creation of human beings to tend the garden) and the end (full communion between God and creatures), creation has had to travel by a long detour, awaiting the completion and perfection of human beings. Only with human beings’ completion and perfection will the work of creation receive its proper orientation and order, and be completed in the Sabbath rest. As it stands, the creation, forced to wait for its completion until humanity has been won back to its proper course, groans, waiting for that completion, just as Christians groan who have the pledge of the Spirit but do not yet experience the full reality of their relationship to the Father. The Spirit is the pledge of the completion of creation, the agency of God to draw creation to that completion which is full and unimpeded relationship with the Father. The Spirit is the power of God working for the perfection of creation; the Spirit is the power of the future.</p>

How can we know the way?’ 6Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you know me, you will know my Father also.

				<p class="text-line-above">Jesus is going to prepare a place for the disciples in his Father’s house, and he will lead them there. They can rest assured; they do not need to be troubled. There is not some extra stage on the journey, hidden from them: they know the way, they can see it clearly (if they would only realize the fact). The way home – the way to their true home with God – is open to them. And that is because Jesus is the way. Not in the sense that he has been made into an arbitrary gatekeeper, such that they have to please him in order to be let into the space he guards, but because the place where they are headed, the life with God which he goes to prepare, is Christ-shaped. To get into this space, you must become Christ-shaped; if you take on a different shape, you arrive somewhere else. And the space that Christ prepares for us is Christ-shaped because God is Christ-shaped: if you have seen Jesus, then you have seen his Father. Jesus is the means by which God has declared to the world the nature of God’s life; Jesus is the means by which God has, as it were, thrown open the doors of God’s life and invited the world to share it.</p>

In verses 15–17 of chapter 14, it becomes clear that Jesus – who goes on ahead to prepare the way, and whose death and resurrection, we might say, complete his demonstration of the shape of God’s life in the midst of the world – does not leave believers simply to trudge along behind him by their own resources, shaping themselves so as to conform to the pattern he has shown them. They yearn to be shaped like Christ, to follow him, to be with him, and that means yearning to obey Christ’s commands (the commands by which he crystallizes for them what it means to live a life shaped like his). But he does not leave them alone in the midst of a world that operates according to thoroughly different criteria, a world that does not recognize this shape of life, a world in which life lived in this fashion is liable to lead to execution. Rather, they are left with the Spirit. The Spirit bears the truth; the Spirit knows the life of God in which all things have their source and end. And in loving Christ, and seeking to follow in Christ’s footsteps, believers already know the Spirit. The Spirit is not something extra, a second lesson after the first lesson that Jesus taught them. The Spirit is, as it were, the power of what Christ has already shown them, the power of Christ’s life, the power of God’s Christ-shaped life, living in the world’s midst – or, rather, the spirit is an agent endowed with that power. The Spirit’s role is fundamentally therefore one of teaching or instructing: of leading believers deeper into the shape of God’s life that Christ has opened up to them. Whenever someone is being led deeper into conformity to Christ, whenever someone is being formed alongside Christ for life with the Father, that simply <span class="italic">is </span>the Spirit at work: that is the power of God’s life, drawing that person to God. The Spirit, for John, is the power of God’s Christ-shaped life, drawing believers ever deeper into that life.</p>
				<p class="quotes">121Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak. 3Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says ‘Jesus be cursed!’ and no one can say ‘Jesus is Lord’ except by the Holy Spirit. 4Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 5and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 6and there are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one. 7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 8To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 9to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">12For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body – Jews or Greeks, slaves or free – and all were made to drink of one Spirit. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">27Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 28And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various kinds of tongues. 29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31But strive for the greater gifts.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">And I will show you a still more excellent way. 131If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">Paul seems to be writing to a community that threatens to be torn apart by the claims to inspiration made by various individuals within it. It sounds as though different people feel that they are being led or impelled by the Spirit in different directions, and there is conflict brewing between them. There are even (perhaps) some who feel that the Spirit is leading them to new areas not obviously connected with what they have learnt of Jesus. This is a community (or a group of individuals) which is concentrating on the power of God they experience working within them, determined to be led by that power wherever it leads, and trusting to that power within them as their authority. And Paul, while not wanting to deny that the Spirit does work within them in powerful ways, explains that they have missed the point: if they think like that, they do not yet know who the Spirit is.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul tells them that they should not be so sure of their instincts, of their experience: after all, didn’t they feel powerfully attracted to idols before they were Christians? Didn’t their experience mislead them then? To say that they have received the Spirit is not simply to give a name to the strong or powerful feelings within them, or to their extraordinary experiences – it is to say that they have received the Spirit <span class="italic">of Jesus</span>. The Spirit is the power who leads them to the true God seen in Jesus (rather than idols); they therefore know the power of the Spirit whenever they are being drawn closer to Jesus, and deny it whenever they are being drawn further away. The Spirit simply is the power who leads them more deeply under the Lordship of Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Think back to the exegesis of text from earlier in this same letter in Chapter 1. I noted Paul’s stress upon the unexpected nature of God that is discovered in Christ: God’s folly and weakness, God’s Christlikeness. The Spirit is the power of God leading the Corinthians more deeply into that knowledge, and anything that does not lead them more deeply into that knowledge is not the Spirit of God, however marvellous, convincing or powerful it may seem to be.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">All the different experiences of empowerment, all the separate gifts that individuals in this community believe themselves to be given, only make sense to the extent that they can be understood as gifts of this one Spirit, gifts of this one Lord. They are gifts that will lead the Corinthians deeper into the knowledge of the one God of Jesus Christ into whose life they have been baptized.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Paul explains further that the individual gifts people receive must not be thought of as gifts that separate some into an elite realm of power and ecstatic experience. They must instead be gifts that feed the whole body, that build it up, bind it together and take the whole body of believers deeper into knowledge of this God. There is, it seems, something about being drawn under the lordship of Christ, something about being drawn deeper into the knowledge of the God of Jesus Christ, that inherently involves being drawn into that knowledge <span class="italic">together</span>. But there is also something about being drawn together in this way that doesn’t involve becoming identical: it doesn’t involve becoming clones of Jesus. Each is empowered in a different way for the sake of the whole body; each is given a different contribution to make. And what matters is not how dramatic or exciting or exotic others find the gift that some individual has, but the extent to which it helps to build up the body. What matters is the extent to which it helps form the people deeper in knowledge and love of the God of Jesus Christ. Some of the most important ways in which that will happen will be by way of inconspicuous service, humble and unobtrusive: if it builds up the body, it is the work of the Spirit no less than the working of miracles or the delivery of prophecies.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It becomes clear later on in 1 Corinthians, by the way, that Paul is particularly fond of prophecy. Prophecy is the speaking of the truth, or the making clear in a particular time and place of what it means to follow Christ and to live according to the Spirit. Prophecy is the naming and exposing of the tempting alternatives that would actually, in this situation, be idolatry. It is the kind of speaking that brings conviction and transformation. But even prophecy is not in itself the point. All these gifts are real gifts, real work of the Spirit, only if they lead people together deeper into the life of God. And that means that they are gifts, are the work of the Spirit only if they lead people deeper into love and justice. If someone does something that works against Christlike love and justice, it is <span class="italic">not </span>the work of the Spirit. If someone does something that leads into Christlike love and justice then it <span class="italic">is </span>the work of the Spirit. That is all that one needs to know. That simply is, for Paul, who the Spirit is, and there is no independent way of identifying the Spirit. The Spirit is the power of God’s Christ-shaped life, drawing Christians together into that life; the Spirit is the power of love drawing them into love.</p>
				<p class="text">These three texts seem to me to complement each other well. They each involve a picture of the Spirit as the power of God drawing people deeper into the life of God; they all involve a picture of the Spirit doing so by conforming people to Christ, who is the image of God’s life. But each passage concentrates on different aspects of this. The Romans 8 passage concentrates on the Spirit’s role in drawing people to God as children of God; the John 14 passage concentrates on the Spirit’s role in leading people deeper into Christ, who is the image of God; and the 1 Corinthians 12 passage concentrates on the Spirit’s role in leading people deeper into love for one another, which is the shape that people’s lives should take if they are being conformed to Christ and so drawn to the Father.</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">I have also suggested that, in these passages, although the Spirit’s power is contrasted with the way of the world – with forms of life and thought that work against love, or that deny the kind of self-giving that Christ displayed – the Spirit is not opposed to matter, or to bodies, or to community. The Spirit is the power of God working to complete and perfect God’s creation, the power of God seeking to unlock and liberate the whole created order. The Spirit is the power of Christ’s bodily resurrection, leading not away from the human body, but to that body’s completion and perfection. The Spirit is the power of God leading people deeper into corporate life, deeper into love for one another – not pulling individuals out into their own private ascent towards God, but sending individuals more deeply into contact with one another. For these biblical authors, the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the life of God, which is love and justice.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Is the Spirit a ‘person’?</span></p>
				<p class="text">Should one call the Holy Spirit a ‘person’? There are various reasons for saying ‘Yes’. In the first place, you may remember that ‘person’ in classical Trinitarian theology is used as an equivalent to the Greek word <span class="italic">hypostasis</span>, and means something like ‘distinguishable reality’. To say that the Spirit is a person is, in the first place, simply to say that one can distinguish the Spirit from the Father and the Son when one talks about God. Even that much might seem questionable, however: it is not clear in the Old Testament texts that we looked at, for instance, that talk of ‘God’s Spirit’ is anything other than a roundabout way of saying ‘God’. Are the Father and the Spirit truly distinguishable? To answer that, we can turn to the second sense of ‘person’ that I used in Chapter 4, and recall that the drama played out in the Gospels and described in the rest of the New Testament is a drama of three <span class="italic">dramatis personae</span>. However mysterious and tenuous the grip of the term <span class="italic">dramatis persona</span> might be on the Spirit, to speak of the Spirit as a person is to assert that talk of the Spirit can’t be completely reduced to talk of the other two <span class="italic">personae</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To call the Spirit a ‘person’ means more than this, though. Christians believe they encounter the Spirit working in and through creaturely realities, communicating God’s love – and we don’t really know how to talk about love without our talk being talk about <span class="italic">persons </span>who love. Love is not an impersonal force, and we do not know how to talk about it without using the language of will, of intention, of attitude. Even if Christians know that such language must fall short of the ungraspable reality of God’s immanent life, and so fall short of the ungraspable reality of the Spirit, it would be a mistake to think that one could do better by saying any <span class="italic">less</span>. Another way of putting this is to say that to speak of the Spirit as a person is a good corrective to any talk of the Spirit that makes her sound like a thing or a force – say, a thing that you have inside of you, or something like a magnetic field, impersonally reorienting everything that comes into its vicinity.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, like all human attempts to speak about God, this stretches language to its limits, and just because Christians might have good reason to call the Spirit a ‘person’ does not mean that they can think of the Spirit as a person <span class="italic">just like them</span>, only invisible and with some amazing powers. It should be no surprise that there will be places where this language breaks down, and that some of the things that the Bible and the Christian tradition find it important to say about the Spirit (that the Spirit is a gift, for example, or that the Spirit is the love that the Father and Son have in common<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-135" id="footnote-169-135-backlink">135</a></span>) don’t sound very personal.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-136" id="footnote-169-136-backlink">136</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-7"><span class="bold">Spirituality</span></p>
				<p class="text">In the next two sections of this chapter, I want to look at two different suggestions that have been made about how Christian life relates to the Spirit. In each case, it seems to me both that there is much of value, and yet that there has been a mistaken attempt to rope off one part or aspect of life and to declare that this in particular is the special preserve of the Spirit. In both cases, even if a Christian’s connection with the Spirit flows out into all the areas of his or her life, it is in this roped-off area specifically that the true home of the Spirit in Christian life is seen. On the one hand, we have some versions of ‘spirituality’, on the other, some tendencies within the charismatic and Pentecostal movements. At least some proponents of each claim that there is a special realm of properly spiritual experience and practice hidden in the heart of Christians’ and others’ lives with God, elevated some distance above ordinary, prosaic life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The word ‘spirituality’ is a popular one these days. A search on the internet for occurrences of the word in April 2007 <span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-137" id="footnote-169-137-backlink">137</a></span> yielded about 60,000,000 results, from all sorts of sources; I’m afraid I didn’t manage to check all of them. Some are affiliated with particular religious organizations (so the first result from the web search was from www.spirituality.com, which is actually a website for the Christian Science movement); others declare their allegiance to broader movements or traditions (e.g. a page from www.greenspirit.org.uk on Native American spirituality); others are not tied so closely to any one organization or tradition (e.g. www.spiritualityandpractice.com).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">According to the ‘Spirituality and Practice’ website:</p>
				<p class="quotes">To be spiritual is to have an abiding respect for the great mysteries of life – the profound distinctiveness of other souls, the strange beauty of nature and the animal world, the ineffable complexity of our inner selves, the unfathomable depths of the Inexplicable One. The first step in the practice of mystery is to cherish the baffling, curious, hidden, and inscrutable dimensions of your existence and the world around you. Live with paradoxes. Give up the idea that you can always ‘get it’. Be suspicious of all the ‘ologies’ that try to explain everything – from astrology to psychology to theology.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-138" id="footnote-169-138-backlink">138</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The ‘Spirituality and Health’ site says,</p>
				<p class="quotes">we’re talking about experience, not doctrine. Though spirituality is a part of all religions, no religion can own it, and those who aren’t comfortable with organized religion are no less involved in the journey. This approach honors questions, mysteries, and journeys of discovery over dogmatic answers, closed systems, and now-you’ve-made-it destinations. Respecting and drawing upon the world’s great wisdom traditions (religions) as well as the latest insights from medicine, psychology, sociology, ecology, and the natural sciences, we speak to people from various religious traditions or no religious tradition at all.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-139" id="footnote-169-139-backlink">139</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Between them, the two sites capture much of the meaning of ‘spirituality’ in popular culture.</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Although the language is different, there is much here that resonates with themes touched on already in this book: the idea of a journey of discovery into ‘the unfathomable depths of the Inexplicable One’, of exploring mystery, of honouring questions; the rejection of the idea that one can finally ‘get it’, and of attempts to explain everything, a resistance to ‘now-you’ve-made-it destinations’. And looking more broadly at these sites and at others with a similar ethos, there is a strong sense that spirituality is not concerned so much with getting the right ideas, as with developing the right practices – practices that will help shape one’s life into a journey of healing exploration. And even though both sites illustrate an anti-doctrinal or anti-theological cast widespread in contemporary spiritual writing, it is hard not to feel that there too they have a point. There are all too many examples of theological writing and doctrinal proclamation that clearly do tie everything up too neatly, and make God (and human beings’ journey into God) an explicable object of exactly the wrong sort. You may feel that this book itself has fallen into that trap in the last three chapters.</p>

				</table>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">In one sense, then, I have been talking about ‘spirituality’ all along, even though this is a book of theology and of Christian doctrine. And that should not be a surprise. After all, one definition that Christian theology could offer of ‘spirituality’ would simply be ‘life in the Spirit’: life as it is guided by, filled by, impelled by, uplifted by the Spirit; life given over to the Spirit; life exploring the things of the Spirit. Spirituality has to do, a Christian might say, with the Spirit welling up within us, and with all the practices or dispositions that might clear the channel for that upwelling, or stimulate it. To focus on ‘spirituality’ is, in Christianity, simply to take one way of talking about the whole journey of learning and unlearning by which the Spirit leads people deeper into the life of God. In other words, for Christian theology ‘spirituality’ is really just another name for Christian life, because Christian life simply <span class="italic">is </span>life in the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If this is right, however, then there are various consequences. In the first place, it makes no sense to think that ‘spirituality’ could be a distinct <span class="italic">part </span>of Christian life, something one might be engaged in only some of the time. It doesn’t make sense to think of spirituality even as a constant accompaniment to the other, more mundane aspects of one’s life. It doesn’t make sense to think of spirituality as the bit of Christian life that happens when one is on one’s own, or a bit of Christian life that happens when one turns from action to contemplation, or a bit of Christian life that involves one escaping for a while from one’s responsibilities and relationships, or the bits of Christian life that take place when one is calm, centred and breathing slowly. We might even say that it doesn’t make sense – despite the impression given by popular accounts – to think that spirituality could be separated from institutions, traditions and doctrines. If life uplifted by the Spirit, life exploring the things of the Spirit, the life of learning and unlearning on the way to God, is the whole of Christian life, then it is just as much what Christians do together, what they do when they are organised, what they do when they are fulfilling their obligations, what they do when they talk and eat and work and relax and argue and calculate and decide. For Christian theology, spirituality covers the whole of Christian life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the second place, if the analysis I have been giving in this chapter so far is right, the work of the Spirit is to lead people before the Father, by shaping them after the Son. The Spirit is, for Christian theology, that power of God that lures and woos and impels and drives and enables and drags and excites people on journeys deeper into the God of Jesus Christ. ‘Spirituality’ can’t, in a Trinitarian context, be a name Christians give to some aspect of their lives that is related to the Spirit, as distinct from aspects that have to do with the Father and the Son. Things simply don’t divide up that way. And that means that Christians cannot separate a sphere of spirituality from the pursuit of the Father’s kingdom, opened up to them by the Son. Christians cannot separate a sphere of spirituality from the pursuit of love and justice in the world. There is, for Christian theology, no sphere of ‘spirituality’ separable from the involvements, the compromises, the negotiations, the politics by which common life is formed, and by which the powers of injustice are challenged.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-8"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">‘Spirituality’ concerns the shaping of lives, individually and corporately, by the Spirit, in conformity to Christ, on the way to the Father;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">‘Spirituality’ is therefore simply another name, in Christian theology, for the whole life of faith – including its institutional and its political aspects.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-9"><span class="bold">The Spirit-filled life</span></p>
				<p class="text">We can’t talk about ‘life filled by the Spirit’, and read passages like 1 Corinthians 12, without thinking about the Pentecostal and charismatic movements, which have had such a sweeping influence on the church over the last century. There is no way that I can hope to give an adequate overview of the variety of theologies and practices associated with this diverse family of movements. Rather than attempting that, therefore, I am going to approach this topic a little differently. I am going to introduce each of a series of sub-topics by describing some relevant experience from my own past, and then describe how I now assess that experience as an academic theologian, in the light of the kind of theology I have been presenting. By doing this I hope to make it clear that I am simply reflecting on one person’s experience of one variety of charismatic theology and practice, at one period in its development, hazarding criticisms whose applicability to other varieties of charismatic or Pentecostal life is questionable. My aim, after all, is not to provide a comprehensive appreciation or critique of these movements, but by thinking through this one example to clarify some aspects of the doctrine of the Spirit and the ways in which it might relate to Christian life.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Baptism in the Holy Spirit</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">I was brought up in a charismatic evangelical Anglican church, and until my mid twenties would unhesitatingly have described myself as a ‘charismatic’, and regarded that movement as one of the only hopes for the renewal and purification of the contemporary Church.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What did that mean? Well – to use the categories that I would have used at the time, which I think were normal in that particular context even if they might not now be so characteristic of the movement – one of the crucial aspects was that I had had an experience that I called ‘baptism in the Spirit’. If you had asked me back when I was in my late teens, I would have described it something like this: I had been a Christian for several years, but was aware at some level that I was paddling in the shallows. I was, that is, aware that there were others around me who had a seriousness of commitment and intensity of devotion which, to be frank, I envied, even though it frightened me and even though I found plenty of excuses not yet to travel too far down that path.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">However, the sense that there was more to Christian life than I was experiencing, and that I was holding out against that ‘more’, grew, until one particular Sunday evening, in a context of prayer and worship, I had an experience in which I felt that this logjam had suddenly been released. That evening, I experienced an intensity of devotion and joy that (I would have said then) was greater than anything I had known – but, more significantly, I felt able to make a deeper commitment to living the Christian faith, to swimming out from the shallows, than I had done before. Although the particular intensity of that evening faded, it did lead to genuine changes in my life: to new patterns of worship, to what seemed like access to new levels of devotional feeling and a new emotional involvement in worship, and to a greater level of commitment to living out the consequences of my faith in the various parts of my life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">At that time, following the normal categories used in my church, I would have described this as ‘baptism in the Holy Spirit’, and seen it as a sort of personal Pentecost.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-140" id="footnote-169-140-backlink">140</a></span> It was not, in the thinking of that church, or in many charismatic and Pentecostal circles, the same as conversion: the two were distinct (though they could in some individuals occur at the same time). Both were normally peak experiences of sudden release and transformation, but while conversion was about initially coming to faith, and ‘being saved’, and was complete and effective in itself, baptism in the Holy Spirit was about being oriented and equipped for the long haul of the life of faith.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As I say, I am trying to describe this using the categories I would have used at the time. Many involved in charismatic renewal or in the Pentecostal movement would describe things in very different ways, or expect very different patterns of experience – but I don’t think that my particular experience and way of understanding it would have been that uncommon at the time.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What are we to make of it? We can begin with a twofold warning. On the one hand, if any of this is taken as a suggestion that the Spirit is only present in some Christians, it is heading in a dangerous direction. Recall what I said back in Chapter 4: ‘Christian life is … life in the Spirit. It is life that has been invaded by, transformed by, overwhelmed by, the Spirit. … And this same Christian life is life following Jesus.’ If talk of ‘baptism in the Spirit’ as something separate from ‘conversion to Christ’ drives any kind of wedge between ‘life following Jesus’ and ‘life in the Spirit’, then it is a step away from Trinitarian theology, and a step away from the theology of Paul and John that we examined in the last section. On the other hand, the same <span class="italic">theological</span> worry has a direct <span class="italic">practical</span> application. If this talk of baptism in the Spirit is taken to suggest that there are fundamentally two ranks of Christians, then it is a theology that divides the body of Christ. And, looking at the way in which Paul in 1 Corinthians 12 describes the work of the Spirit, and gives us criteria for identifying the Spirit, we could say quite straightforwardly that if talk of baptism in the Spirit is used to stake out a fundamental division in the body of Christ, then it has nothing to do with the Spirit of Jesus. (And that means that if we feel able easily and as a matter of course to divide Christians or churches up into the ‘live’ and the ‘dead’, as I know I used to when I was a charismatic teenager, we are speaking against the Spirit of God.)</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Having issued these warnings, however, I can say something more positive. The theology I have been presenting in this chapter would certainly agree that the Spirit leads people ever deeper into the life of God, on that journey of learning and unlearning that has been my subject matter through so much of this book so far. And it is certainly plausible to suggest that some moments of learning-and-unlearning – moments when one finds one’s implicit idols shattered, and oneself reoriented to Christ – could be quite intense emotional and devotional experiences, even ‘crisis’ experiences. So we could certainly agree that the Christian life could for some involve a series of crisis experiences appropriately judged to be the work of the Spirit. We might even, in a particular situation, believe that whole communities stand in need of some ‘wake-up call’ of this form – although the danger is very high in such talk of falling into some kind of arrogant supposition that <span class="italic">they</span> need revival, while <span class="italic">we</span> have arrived. On the other hand, I don’t see any way of saying that the Spirit’s work <span class="italic">must </span>take the form of crisis experiences, and certainly do not see how one could argue that there must be any fixed number or sequence to them. Nevertheless, if we were to speak in terms of the possibility of baptism<span class="italic">s</span> in the Spirit, repeated events in which people are drawn ever deeper into Christ, we might not be too wide of the mark, at least for some people, some of the time.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Speaking in tongues</span></p>
				<p class="text">Having been, as I saw it, ‘baptized in the Spirit’ I also (some time later) ‘spoke in tongues’: that is, I experienced a sort of stream of freewheeling unintelligible babbling which allowed an outlet for (and, later on, a form of always-available doorway into) intense devotional feelings of various kinds that seemed to exceed my normal capacities of verbal expression.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">At the time, I believed that this was – or at least was supposed to be – some kind of actual language, perhaps a heavenly language. I relished stories (many of which did the rounds) about people speaking in tongues and discovering that they were (like the apostles at Pentecost in Acts 2.4–6) speaking without understanding it themselves the language of some nearby foreigner. Or there were stories about scientific studies of tongues that had supposedly shown it to have the structure of real language, but no language known on earth. For myself, as far back as I can remember I was fighting a fairly deep-seated suspicion that in my case at least tongues was simply nonsense babbling, but I know I was at the sceptical end of the spectrum in that context.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Having once started, I continued to use tongues in private devotional prayer, at least sporadically. There were also contexts in services where everyone would pray out loud in tongues together, in a sort of strange half-singing tone that could sometimes be eerily beautiful. Sometimes, when in small groups praying about something specific, I or someone else would pray for a while in tongues. And occasionally, during times of open prayer in a service, someone would stand up and deliver what we used to call a ‘word in tongues’: an example of speech in tongues felt to be a message for the community as a whole – unintelligible until the speaker or someone else in the room was ‘given the interpretation’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The church I was in thought baptism in the Spirit and speaking in tongues of very differing importance. Baptism in the Spirit was for everyone, although some new converts might experience it at the same time as conversion. Speaking in tongues was simply one possible ‘gift’ that some people who had been baptized in the Spirit might receive – and, however much it enabled the personal devotion of the person who received it, it was seen as one of the less important gifts (something which I realize is not the case in all corners of the charismatic and Pentecostal movement).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This time, let me start with the positive. One of the ways in which one might be taken deeper on the journey into knowledge of God is precisely by learning one’s limitations, and so it makes sense to think that part of what one needs is some witness to the inadequacy of one’s words and ideas: some kind of witness to the fact that God is always greater, always exceeds one’s grasp. Traditionally, the most important form of such witness is silence: falling into silence when one’s words run out, when one realizes that however much they point one in the right direction, however much they are, so far as they go, true (by the grace of God) they are nevertheless deeply inadequate. Speaking in tongues can, at its best, function in a similar way, and can perhaps be a salutary witness when reverent silence itself has become something one thinks one can understand and grasp – a witness to the breakdown of one’s words of praise and prayer. God is greater than one’s words, and one’s words need to be broken and remade if they are to point to God – and even then, God will exceed them. Prayer dissolving into a kind of verbal noise can be a powerful witness to the reality of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, here too we need to step gingerly. We have to guard against the kind of elitism that might come with saying that ‘real Christians’ speak in tongues, or that it is some mark of holiness or power. But I don’t think that was much of a temptation in the context in which I grew up, and that suggests pretty strongly that it is not an <span class="italic">inherent</span> part of the package. We also, perhaps more seriously, need to ask whether and how speaking in tongues does genuinely build up faith. I have outlined one way in which it might, but Paul’s rather ambivalent explanations of tongues in 1 Corinthians 14 should at least give us some pause. Only if it builds up the body of Christ, only if it takes one deeper on the journey into knowledge of God, can one think of it as a gift of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Beside those questions (Does it build up the people of God? Does it take one deeper into God?), all other questions about tongues pale into insignificance, at least for a theologian. Certainly questions about whether it is ‘miraculous’ or ‘supernatural’ are all but irrelevant. One doesn’t find out whether something is from God by working out whether it is miraculous or supernatural: one finds out by asking whether it leads one back to God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Nevertheless, as an aside, I should perhaps say that I am now personally convinced that speaking in tongues is not ‘miraculous’ or ‘supernatural’ – at least, not in the sense I would have believed when I was younger. That does not make me think it is not still valuable – though I think it helps me to ask precisely <span class="italic">what</span> its value is a little more calmly, without thinking it has to be all good or all bad, absolutely angelic or absolutely demonic. Speaking in tongues in various forms is a well-known religious phenomenon, one that normally occurs in heightened emotional and devotional states (at least initially), and which does so in all sorts of different religious contexts, Christian and non-Christian. It is precisely what it seems to be: a process in which the speech-making centres in the brain are excited, but without as it were going through the normal channels, the constraints of vocabulary and syntax. It doesn’t make sense; it is not a language. And it is precisely because of that that it can speak to me of a God who is beyond my language, and beyond any language.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">However, as I say, I do not think the debate about whether tongues is supernatural or natural is theologically very interesting – and the same would go for other gifts, like ‘healing’ and ‘words of knowledge’, things which we do not have space to go into here. To repeat: the general rule, which seems to me to be what Paul teaches us in 1 Corinthians 12 to 14, is that one doesn’t check whether something is from God by working out whether it is miraculous or supernatural: one checks by asking whether it leads one deeper into the life of God.</p>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Worship and ministry</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">I want to finish on a positive note, having been negative or ambivalent so far. There are two major effects that the charismatic movement has had, which are more straightforwardly positive. The first is in worship. The idea that worship should be lively and involving, and that it should make space for real emotional engagement, while by no means the exclusive possession of the charismatic movement, has certainly been an idea that has spread with renewed vigour with that movement’s help. There are excesses of course, and anyone who has had any experience of them at all can point to some absolutely atrocious worship songs, or to worrying wider trends in worship-song lyrics – but then, that is as true of the older hymn-writing tradition, or indeed of any widespread and popular tradition of worship in the Church. It may not be a form of worship that engages everyone. (Perhaps as a reaction against my upbringing, I personally would not be unhappy if I never heard another worship song as long as I lived, and find that the kind of emotional intensity I once experienced in charismatic services I am now most likely to experience in something like an English cathedral evensong, if there is a very good choir.) Nevertheless, I think that when people look back on this period of Church history from some time in the future, they will see one of those explosions of intensity and excitement about worship that shake the Church periodically, and one that, however much it has (like all other such explosions) produced immense amounts of forgettable dross, and had its ambiguous aspects, has nevertheless contributed something powerful and lasting to the overall heritage of the Christian tradition.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But to take this from the level of personal opinion and pontification, and set us back on a more explicitly theological track: if the theology of the Spirit that I have been presenting is on the right lines, then it is indeed something we would expect from the work of the Spirit to take the Church deeper into the worship of God, and to open God’s people up so that the whole of their lives, without reserve (their emotions, their minds, their bodies) are brought to God in worship, and overwhelmed by God there. If the charismatic movement has served as one reminder of this, then it will have done something of great importance.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Second, and with even less ambivalence, I would point to the explosion of interest in charismatic circles in what one might call ‘every member ministry’: the idea that every member of the body of Christ has something to contribute, some gift they have been given, some ministry to perform. If I had to pick one thing to keep from the form of the charismatic movement in which I grew up, it would be this. It seems to be an important renewal of the kind of message about the Spirit’s work that we saw Paul giving in 1 Corinthians 12: the idea that life in the Spirit is life together, and life in which each of us has gifts to offer the body, and gifts to receive from the other members of the body. Life in the Spirit – life conformed to Christ, life directed to the Father – is life in an economy of giving and receiving in which every member is called to play a full role. If the charismatic movement has served as one reminder of this, then it will have done something else of great importance.</p>

				<p class="text">Compare my story with those of other people. You may have had comparable experience yourself, or be studying theology in a class with others who have.

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">This has been a very hasty survey, and has only touched on a few themes from my own experience of the charismatic and Pentecostal movements. As with the earlier discussion of spirituality, however, I hope it is clear that – from the point of view of the kind of theology that I have been exploring – what is valuable in the movement is not some new access to a realm in which the Spirit is <span class="italic">really</span> present, nor any kind of ‘rediscovery’ of the Spirit, nor even some shift back to emphasis on the Spirit after a period of too much emphasis on the Son or the Father, nor any re-injection of the Spirit into churches from which the Spirit had somehow been lacking. Christian lives, whether they are marked by charismatic or Pentecostal experiences or practices or not, are always, without exception, lives lived in the Spirit, alongside the Son, on the way to the Father. Nevertheless, the charismatic and Pentecostal movements, just like other movements of renewal or transformation in the Church, do have their own distinct flavour. To the extent that this flavour becomes a gift for the building up of the whole body of Christ, it will be appropriate to judge these movements as in that degree a work of God’s Spirit.</p>

				<p class="text">‘The face of the Spirit is … the assembly of redeemed human faces in their infinite diversity. Human persons grow to the fullness of <span class="italic">their</span> particular identities, but sharing in the common divine gift of reconciled life in faith, these are the <span class="italic">Spirit’s</span> manifestation. The Son is manifest in a single, paradigmatic figure, the Spirit is manifest in the “translatability” of that into the contingent diversity of history.’</p>
				<p class="source">Rowan Williams, <span class="italic">On Christian Theology</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-142" id="footnote-169-142-backlink">142</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above">The Spirit is the power of God drawing people deeper into the life of God by conforming them to Christ. Yet it does not make theological sense to think of that ‘becoming Christlike’ as involving people losing their differences, their particularities, so as to become <span class="italic">clones</span> of Christ. To say otherwise would be to assume that Christlikeness was something that could be borne identically by individuals in very different situations (the ‘contingent diversity of history’ in the quote from Rowan Williams above), however different their backgrounds, however different their positions. That in turn would mean that Christlikeness was something that could float above the messy involvements and relationships and histories in which believers are involved. Yet if Christlikeness were that kind of characteristic, it would have to be a characteristic that floated above Jesus’ messy involvements and relationships and history too; it would have to be a characteristic that was only <span class="italic">illustrated</span> by Jesus, but that could have been carried equally well by somebody else. And, finally, to say that would mean that, once one had grasped the point, once one had understood that free-floating characteristic, reference to the actual complex stuff of Jesus’ humanity would become superfluous, even a distraction. He would remain useful as a sermon illustration, perhaps, but the detachable message that he brought would be the real heart of the Gospel, the real focus of Christian faith.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">To say all this would be to deny the doctrine of the incarnation. That doctrine claims, after all, that it is Jesus in his particularity – Jesus as the particular human being he is – who is God’s Word to the world. He is not that Word <span class="italic">despite </span>being Jewish, <span class="italic">despite </span>being male, <span class="italic">despite </span>being from Nazareth, <span class="italic">despite </span>living in a particular time and place. He is God’s Word precisely <span class="italic">as </span>that particular human being. He does not show the world how life is lived fully for God in general, in a way that could simply be repeated identically by anyone; he shows how life is lived fully for God by living his own particular life, in his own particular time and place.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christians believe themselves called to be Christlike, to share in Christ’s movement towards the Father and his movement towards the world that the Father loves, but this is a call that they can only fulfil by looking different from Christ. Just as it was the work of the Spirit to shape Jesus’ life in his own time and place, so the work of the Spirit now is to make each person reflect Christ in his or her own particular way – the way appropriate to his or her circumstances, history, particular gifts, skills and opportunities.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Spirit’s work is to make each person an <span class="italic">exegesis</span> or commentary on Christ: one who shows what Christ’s call can lead to in one particular time and place. Each person, with the Spirit’s guidance, sees Christ from his or her own particular vantage point, and the Spirit’s work is to make that person’s life <span class="italic">show </span>what they <span class="italic">see</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Think of what happens when a biblical text has commentaries written on it. In the first place, no commentary can substitute for the biblical text itself; in the second place, no single commentary could ever be a definitive and final commentary; every commentary is particular. So commentaries are secondary and particular. On the other hand, however, each commentary, if it is a good commentary, can – precisely in its secondariness and particularity – reveal more of the biblical text on which it comments; it can make the biblical text more fully legible.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If each person is made by the Spirit into a commentary on Christ, then while each such reflection is secondary (it is only a reflection, and could never substitute for the face of Christ himself) and particular (it is a commentary from only one particular vantage point), nevertheless each such commentary can make Christ more fully visible. In fact, rather than ‘reflection’, perhaps the appropriate image is ‘refraction’: the Spirit’s work is to split the white light of Christ into a rainbow of particular colours, each of which shows something of what that white light contains.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The only way in which one can learn fully what Christlikeness means is by seeing these particular lives – the life of Christ, and diverse other lives which comment on his – beside each other, mutually interpreting one another. One might see a Francis of Assisi alongside Jesus, and be helped to see more of Jesus by the light one sees in Francis’s face, and more of Francis by seeing him as a refraction of Jesus’ light. And then one turns to a different face – a Dietrich Bonhoeffer, or a Julian of Norwich, or a Thomas Merton, or a Teresa of Avila – and sees Jesus differently again. And then one turns to one’s neighbour and tries to see him or her in the light of the Jesus one has learnt to see in all these other faces, and one tries to discover what particular light this neighbour might himself throw upon Jesus.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">As Rowan Williams has put it, in drawing us into conformity to Christ,</p>
				<p class="quotes">God wants particulars, not generalities. God does not, you might say, create clichés. What is bestowed on each of us is particularity, one utterly distinctive way of being Christlike. If that one distinctive way of being Christlike is frustrated or denied, then something in God’s communication to the world is frustrated and denied. There is a sort of smudge across the revealed face of God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-143" id="footnote-169-143-backlink">143</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Christians <span class="italic">only</span> know Jesus fully – the Jesus of the Gospels, the Jesus who lived, died and rose again in a particular time and place – in the whole body of Christ interpreting and refracting him down the centuries. Jesus is not a principle; he is not the sort of general lesson that could be repeated identically anywhere and everywhere. Jesus is a person, and so the sort of reality that is explored fully only in the endless variety of particular relationships into which he enters. The body of Christ, in the sense Paul explores in 1 Corinthians 12, is the form that the Spirit’s work must take, if the Spirit’s role is to interpret the light of Christ. There is no tension between the <span class="italic">diversifying work</span> by which the Spirit fulfils each person in his or her particularity, making each person to be more, not less, himself or herself, and the <span class="italic">unifying work</span> by which the Spirit draws all people into Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Spirit is, in Christian theology, the transformer of the created world who moulds and kneads human beings in order to shape them for their future, ‘perfecting’ them, fitting them for their share in unfragmented communion. It is the Spirit’s work to save them from isolation and separation, and break them into openness and responsiveness to one another’s differences. It is the Spirit’s work to draw what might otherwise be a cacophonic disunity into symphony. The Spirit worked to transcribe God’s music for playing on the human instrument of Jesus of Nazareth; the Spirit now works to orchestrate that theme for an ensemble of billions.</p>

					<li class="bullet-list">The Spirit’s work is to make each person a particular commentary upon Christ.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">To know Christ fully is to know him as he is commented upon in this way – and so to know the body of Christ.</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-13"><span class="bold">Giving and receiving</span></p>
				<p class="text">The Spirit’s work is the work of <span class="italic">redemption</span>: a work in which each person’s difference, each person’s individuality, is made into a gift to all. This, I think, is the deeper reality of the ‘gifts of the Spirit’ described in 1 Corinthians 12. The gift that each person gives is not, finally, simply something that they <span class="italic">do</span>. The gift is what they <span class="italic">become</span>. The whole person – with all his or her particularity – becomes by the Spirit’s work a gift to the whole body of Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">But if each person is made by the Spirit into a gift, then one must also ask about the ways in which these gifts are received. The Christian is called to become one who can recognize and receive the gifts that other people are becoming. The Christian is called to be attentive to those who do not fit neatly into their schemes and priorities: who show them something <span class="italic">different</span>, something they could not have seen or said themselves. Rowan Williams again:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The stranger … is neither the failed or stupid native speaker, nor someone so terrifyingly alien that I cannot even entertain thought of learning from them. They represent the fact that I have growing to do, not necessarily into anything like an identity with them, but at least into a world where there may be more of a sense of its being a world we <span class="italic">share</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-144" id="footnote-169-144-backlink">144</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">According to this vision, when faced with someone who does not simply replay to me the same old Christ I have already heard – who does not reflect to me Christ’s light in precisely the colour I expect – I am called neither to condemn that difference as failure, nor to assume that that person is reflecting a different Christ, but rather to explore patiently how it might be that the Jesus who I know but who is not exhausted by my knowledge could be reflected from such different angles, in such different colours. I am called to look for the Christ that we share. Any challenges that we might make to one another, challenges to those aspects of each of our refractions of Christ that the other simply can’t recognize as Christlike, must emerge from such serious, generous and hopeful paying of attention.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-11-15"><span class="bold">The Spirit in the world</span></p>
				<p class="text">On the one hand, the Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus, and so the work of the Spirit has a definite particularity to it: Christians who look to discern where the Spirit is present and active are looking to discover where they are shown more of this particular human life. On the other hand, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the God of the whole earth, and is present and active in all creation, and so there can be, in principle, no boundaries to where Christians look for this gift. Wherever they find Christlike love and justice emerging in the midst of the world, or love and justice that make them understand more about Christlikeness, that simply is the work of the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is not a matter of searching for inexplicable occurrences of love and justice, sorting through the known causes of events and speaking of the Spirit only where some unknown, mysterious cause seems to be at work. Identifying the presence and activity of the Spirit is not a matter of causal explanation. The Spirit, as we saw very early on in the chapter, is at work in all creation, sustaining and upholding, so the ordinary causal connections of events are the realm of the Spirit just as much as their interruption or deflection.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-145" id="footnote-169-145-backlink">145</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Rather, discerning the presence and activity of the Spirit is a matter of learning to recognize <span class="italic">who</span> is at work. What is the world? A great mess of events and circumstances, of causes and chances, interactions and ramifications. Yes, but look again: what is this? It is an arena in which, in fits and starts, in chances and changes, the life of God, Christlike life, can be seen. The life of God is here. So <span class="italic">who</span> do you see? It is God the eternal Spirit; it is the Spirit’s self-portrait in countless faces, and the Spirit gives itself to the world in this way.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-146" id="footnote-169-146-backlink">146</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">According to Christian theology, the Spirit is, as I have said, at work in the whole of creation, upholding it, and animating it. And the Spirit is at work wherever human beings are being freed to become fully human, in the sense displayed in Christ. So the Spirit is at work not by simply neutrally holding creation in existence, but by labouring in creation to finish it, to complete it, to fulfil and perfect it, freeing it to be itself, drawing it to the end for which it was created. It is to this work of creation – a work that has its origin in the Father, its shape and exemplar in the Son, and its fulfilment in the Spirit – that we now turn.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">On the Holy Spirit</span></p>
				<p class="text">In the late fourth century, there were long debates about the nature of the Holy Spirit, and specifically about whether the Spirit was truly divine, or was rather one of God’s creatures. Basil of Caesarea was one of the theologians who argued most strongly that, as the Spirit is one person in the threefold economy by which the world is drawn into the life of God, so (as the revision of the Nicene Creed at Constantintople in 381 was to put it) the Spirit is truly ‘the Lord, the giver of life’, who ‘with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-147" id="footnote-169-147-backlink">147</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Basil wrote that the Spirit</p>
				<p class="quotes">is called ‘Spirit of God’ (Matthew 12.28), ‘Spirit of truth which proceeds from the Father’ (John 15.26), ‘right Spirit’ (Psalm 51.10), ‘a leading Spirit’ (Psalm 51.12). Its proper and peculiar title is ‘Holy Spirit’, which is a name specially appropriate to everything that is incorporeal, purely immaterial, and indivisible.  So our Lord, when teaching the woman who thought God to be an object of local worship that the incorporeal is incomprehensible, said ‘God is a spirit’ (John 4.24).  On our hearing, then, of a spirit, it is impossible to form the idea of a nature circumscribed, subject to change and variation, or at all like the creature.  We are compelled to advance in our conceptions to the highest, and to think of an intelligent essence, in power infinite, in magnitude unlimited, unmeasured by times or ages, generous of its good gifts, to whom turn all things needing sanctification, after whom reach all things that live in virtue, as being watered by its inspiration and helped on toward their natural and proper end; perfecting all other things, but itself in nothing lacking; living not as needing restoration, but as supplier of life; not growing by additions, but straightway full, self-established, omnipresent; origin of sanctification; light perceptible to the mind, supplying, as it were, through itself, illumination to every faculty in the search for truth; by nature unapproachable, apprehended by reason of goodness, filling all things with its power. … It sends forth grace sufficient and full for all mankind, and is enjoyed by all who share it, according to the capacity, not of its power, but of their nature.</p>

The clip they provide is made up of several extracts from an American worship service, where singing in English eventually gives way to singing in tongues.</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">When running through Old Testament references, there were various texts I left out (as explained in note 1 below). That omission made it easier to treat the Old Testament material as a collection of texts that made clear reference to a single, distinguishable reality: the Holy Spirit of God. Our task was then simply that of summarizing what those texts said about this reality. If the disallowed texts are allowed into the picture as well, however, it might become clearer that there are varieties of uses of ‘spirit’ language in the Old Testament, without clear-cut edges between them, and that while some of them sound like they are referring to the ‘Spirit of God’ in a sense something like the New Testament sense, others of them are clearly not – and there is a wide grey area between the two categories. This raises two connected critical questions. On the one hand, there is a question about the kind of interpretation I was engaged in. What authorizes the decision to look for texts that seem to describe the ‘Spirit of God’, and to divide them from those texts that use ‘spirit’ in other ways, but which are unsystematically mixed in with them? And what authorizes the assumption that these very various Old Testament texts all describe the same distinguishable reality? On the other hand, what is the connection between the Spirit of God, the human spirit, the various kinds of spirit that God can be said to send or that can be said to comfort or afflict people, and so on? If the Old Testament can slip from talking about one of these to talking about another without apparent distinction, what does that imply?</li>

						<p class="Endnote-Text"><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-169-134-backlink" id="footnote-169-134">134</a> I have excluded texts from three rather grey areas. There are places where it is said that God has given or will give someone a such-and-such spirit. ‘I’ll give you a languishing spirit’, for instance, in Deuteronomy 28.65 – that seems to be a fairly obvious circumlocution for ‘I’ll make <span class="italic">your</span> spirit languish; I’ll make <span class="italic">you</span> languish.’ Then there are texts that, like Joshua 5.1, speak of someone simply ‘having spirit’; those <span class="italic">could</span> be about having <span class="italic">the</span> Spirit, or God’s Spirit, but to my mind they seem more likely to be a more metaphorical usage: a way of saying someone has vitality, energy, resilience. Lastly, I’ve left out texts like 1 Samuel 16.14 about God sending an evil spirit to trouble someone. In that passage from 1 Samuel, the evil spirit is explicitly contrasted with God’s Spirit, and I’ve taken my cue from that passage, and excluded these ‘evil spirit’ passages from my list.</p>
