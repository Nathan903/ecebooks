				<p class="text">In Chapter 2, I argued that Christians can make sense of their lives, individually and corporately, as journeys on which they are being drawn deeper into the life of God. In this chapter, drawing on some of the distinctions and vocabulary established in Chapter 3, I am going to fill in some more colour in this picture, and argue that this Christian journey must be thought of as a threefold journey into the triune life of God. In other words, my presentation has now reached one of the core doctrines of the Christian faith: the doctrine of the Trinity. Classical Christian theology claims that God should be understood as one God in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and although that claim may seem a world away from the discussions of my earlier chapters, I will argue that all the main building blocks for the doctrine are already in place.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">highlight two patterns in the Gospels – the first showing Jesus and the Spirit pointing to the Father, the second showing the Father and the Spirit pointing to Jesus;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that it is by knowing and sharing in the ‘economy’ made up of these patterns that Christians know God;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that the God who is known in this way is not best thought of as an isolated individual;</li>

					<li class="bullet-list">Unless you have had no encounter at all with the doctrine of the Trinity, you might have at least a vague idea of what it is supposed to mean. Jot down for yourself now, very briefly, your current understanding of what the doctrine claims. It will be helpful later on to see whether and how your thinking has changed or developed.</li>

				<p class="text">Books on the doctrine of the Trinity crowd the shelves these days, and it is difficult to choose between them. Nevertheless, if you are looking to accompany this chapter with some alternative accounts of the doctrine that steer clear of unnecessary technicalities, and remain grounded in Christian sense-making, I would recommend:</p>
				<p class="references">Christopher Cocksworth, <span class="italic">Holy, Holy, Holy: Worshipping the Trinitarian God</span>, Trinity and Truth series (London: DLT, 1997). An accessible account of the Trinity that, as the title suggests, keeps its eye firmly on Christian worship.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-1"><span class="bold">The kingdom of God</span></p>
				<p class="text">All that I have said so far about love and the knowledge of God must seem a world away from the teaching that Christians worship ‘one God in three persons’. That doctrine might seem to require a journey away from attention to lives caught up in the life of God and toward something much more technical, abstract and speculative.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The first and most important step in the journey that leads to the doctrine of the Trinity is, however, a step <span class="italic">away </span>from abstraction. I am going to start from the rather general things I said in Chapters 2 and 3 about how the world has been addressed lovingly by God in Jesus of Nazareth, and push in the direction of the biblical stories and sayings that can give those claims more detailed content.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus of Nazareth pointed to the God whom he called ‘Father’. He is portrayed in the Gospels as one whose ministry was devoted to speaking about this Father to the people around him, and to calling those people to respond to this Father with trust, delight and obedience. He spoke in parables of the extravagant, questing mission of the Father to his people, calling them back to himself: the Father is the shepherd searching for his lost sheep (Matthew 18.12–14 and Luke 15.3–7), or the father eagerly awaiting his prodigal son (Luke 15.11–31), or the woman desperately hunting for a lost coin (Luke 15.8–10). And he spoke of the unlimited demand entailed by response to this Father: allegiance to the Father is, for instance, the pearl of great price, or the hidden treasure that will cost everything (Matthew 13.44–6); the way to the Father is the way of the cross, and to follow it is to lose one’s life (Matthew 16.24; Mark 8.34; Luke 9.23).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The image around which Jesus arranged all this teaching was the ‘kingdom of God’ or ‘kingdom of heaven’. That kingdom is both the great banquet to which all are invited (Matthew 22.2–14; Luke 14.16–24), and the imminent judgement of all that contradicts its rule (Matthew 24.45—25.13; Luke 12.35–48). Jesus acts out the invitation to this banquet by eating with tax collectors and sinners, and welcoming them to his table (Mark 2.15–17; Matthew 9.10–12; Luke 5.29–31; 15.1–2); he voices the kingdom’s judgement against all that would close its doors in his condemnation of the hypocritical and the self-righteous (Matthew 23.1–36).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The establishment of this kingdom is not simply to be seen as an exercise of God’s <span class="italic">power</span>. Jesus announces the kingdom of God as the regime of love and justice (Matthew 22.36–39; Luke 4.18–19), and his invitation to this kingdom is an invitation to a life that will live God’s love in all circumstances: the command to love God and neighbour sounds the keynote of the kingdom (Matthew 22.37–40; Mark 12.29–31; Luke 10.27).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Jesus’ life, as portrayed in the Gospels, is saturated with this proclamation: he simply <span class="italic">is</span> the one who points the world to the Father’s kingdom, and so points the world to the Father.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Ignoring the kingdom?</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Some writers have found in Jesus’ proclamation of the kingdom of God or kingdom of heaven not a doorway into Trinitarian thought, as I will be suggesting, but a welcome escape from it, and from other ecclesiastical doctrines. H. G. Wells spoke for many when he wrote:</p>
				<p class="quotes">[I]t is a matter of fact that in the gospels all that body of theological assertion which constitutes Christianity finds little support. There is, as the reader may see for himself, no clear and emphatic assertion in these books of the doctrines which Christian teachers of all denominations find generally necessary to salvation. Except for one or two passages in St John’s Gospel it is difficult to get any words actually ascribed to Jesus in which he claimed to be the Jewish Messiah (rendered in Greek by ‘the Christ’) and still more difficult is it to find any claim to be a part of the godhead, or any passage in which he explained the doctrine of the Atonement or urged any sacrifices or sacraments (that is to say, priestly offices) upon his followers. We shall see presently how later on all Christendom was torn by disputes about the Trinity. There is no evidence that the apostles of Jesus ever heard of the Trinity – at any rate from him …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">As remarkable is the enormous prominence given by Jesus to the teaching of what he called the Kingdom of Heaven, and its comparative insignificance in the procedure and teaching of most of the Christian churches.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">This doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching of Jesus, and which plays so small a part in the Christian creeds, is certainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines that ever stirred and changed human thought. … For the doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, was no less than a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete change and cleansing of the life of our struggling race, an utter cleansing, without and within.</p>
				<p class="source">H. G. Wells, <span class="italic">The Outline of History</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-75" id="footnote-169-75-backlink">75</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">One can add the Spirit of God to this picture. The Spirit is portrayed in the Gospels as that power of God that enables and impels Jesus’ ministry, and as the power that is promised to Jesus’ disciples to enable and impel them to respond to his proclamation of the Father’s kingdom. The Spirit is the one who makes the kingdom of God, the kingdom of love and justice, real in Jesus’ life and in the life of his followers. The Spirit is the Spirit <span class="italic">of </span>this kingdom (John 3.5–8).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">For the Spirit as the one shaping Jesus’ life and ministry, think of the claim that Mary’s pregnancy was the work of the Spirit (Matthew 1.18–20; Luke 1.35); think of the Spirit pictured as a dove descending on Jesus at his baptism (Matthew 3.16; Mark 1.10; Luke 3.22; John 1.32–33) and as propelling him into the wilderness straight afterwards (Matthew 4.1; Mark 1.12; Luke 4.1); think of the description of Jesus as the one anointed by the Spirit to proclaim justice (Matthew 12.18; Luke 4.18–19), and the claim that his ministry in general is carried out by the power of the Spirit (Matthew 12.28; Luke 4.14; John 3.34).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">For the Spirit as the one promised to the disciples, to enable and impel their discipleship, think of the claim that Jesus is the one who will ‘baptize with the Holy Spirit’ (Matthew 3.11; Mark 1.8; Luke 3.16), and of Jesus’ followers as those who will receive the Spirit from him (Luke 11.13; John 7.39); think of the claim that this Spirit will enliven them (John 6.63) and speak through them (Matthew 10.20; Mark 13.11; Luke 12.12). In John’s Gospel most clearly, the Spirit is the one who will continue the ministry of Jesus, drawing his followers into the love of God that he proclaimed and embodied (John 14.26, 15.26, 16.13). The Spirit impels and completes the work that defined Jesus’ life and ministry: the mission to proclaim and extend the kingdom of the Father.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-3"><span class="bold">The beloved Son</span></p>
				<p class="text">Jesus, empowered by God’s Spirit, proclaims and extends the kingdom of the Father; the Spirit empowers and completes this work. Jesus and the Spirit draw the world to the Father.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Some readers will already be trying to join the dots and turn this summary into the doctrine of the Trinity. Others will be trying to rub out lines they think I am already drawing between these dots, if they suspect the doctrine of the Trinity is being smuggled in under their noses. At this stage, however, I mean no more than I say: that we find portrayed in the Gospels this pattern of relationship between God, Jesus of Nazareth (who calls God ‘Father’) and the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In order to take a second step towards the doctrine of the Trinity, there is another pattern that we must attend to in the Gospel narratives: that by which the Father directs our attention to Jesus of Nazareth, and by so doing defines himself <span class="italic">as</span> the Father of this Son.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The crucial instance of this pattern comes with the resurrection. Jesus, the one who points to the Father, does not in the climax of the story step aside so that our gaze can pass from him and on to the Father. Rather, in the climax of the story, the Father places Jesus centre-stage: having handed everything over to the Father (‘Father, into your hands I commend my spirit’, Luke 23.46; ‘it is finished’, John 19.30) Jesus is resurrected and our eyes are drawn firmly back to him.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-76" id="footnote-169-76-backlink">76</a></span> The most persistent theme of the resurrection stories is recognition of Jesus (Matthew 28.7, 10, 17–18; Mark 16.7; Luke 24.27, 31, 39; John 20.16, 18, 20, 26–31; 21.7), and in those stories, the proclaimer (the one who devoted himself to pointing away from himself and towards the kingdom) becomes the proclaimed (the one on whose face our eyes become fixed).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-77" id="footnote-169-77-backlink">77</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">This pattern can also be found in a crystallized form in two Gospel narratives in which the Father makes his only direct appearances in the narrative – or rather, when he has his only direct speaking role. The Father speaks in order to commend Jesus as his son at his baptism: ‘You are my son, the beloved, with you I am well pleased’ (Mark 1.11; Luke 3.22; cf. Matthew 3.17), and more fully at the transfiguration: ‘This is my son, the beloved; listen to him!’ (Mark 9.7; cf. Luke 9.35 and Matthew 17.5).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One can find more direct reflection on this theme in the Gospels as well. There is Matthew 11.27:</p>
				<p class="quotes">All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">But the theme is most ruminatively and expansively explored in John’s Gospel, which insists that to know Jesus <span class="italic">is</span> to know the Father. See, for instance, John 14.8–9:</p>
				<p class="quotes">Philip said to him, ‘Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.’</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">The Father has given Jesus to the world to allow the world to know the Father, and the world will know the Father not simply by looking where Jesus is pointing, but by looking at Jesus himself. John 3.16, that most famous of all biblical verses, proclaims the same message: ‘For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-78" id="footnote-169-78-backlink">78</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus is certainly, in the Gospels, one who predominantly points away from himself to the Father. He is clearly portrayed as one who depends on the Father, who is obedient to the Father, whose source and goal is the Father, who is subordinate to the Father. Yet in the same Gospels the Father also points away from himself towards Jesus. If one looks to the Father, seeking to know him and him alone, one finds him pointing to Jesus, and telling us to listen to this his son.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This rhythm in the Gospel portrayals resonates with one of the most striking facts about early Christianity: the role that Jesus played in Christian devotion. In the words of the New Testament scholar Larry Hurtado, ‘a noteworthy devotion to Jesus emerge[d] phenomenally early in circles of his followers’ and it ‘was exhibited in an unparalleled intensity and diversity of expression, for which we have no true analogy in the religious environment of the time’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-79" id="footnote-169-79-backlink">79</a></span> We simply don’t have evidence for a time in early Christianity when Jesus was not already the focus of devotion. The pattern in the gospel that shows us God, the focus of all worship, directing our attention to Jesus matches what did in fact happen among early Christians. Jesus was not simply seen as one who had communicated the proper form of devotion and discipleship, nor simply as one whose ministry had made proper devotion and discipleship possible: continued devout attention to Jesus himself was taken to be essential to proper devotion and discipleship. A focus on Jesus was at the core of Christian life, as the means by which a proper relation to God was shaped and upheld. As Jesus says in John 17.3, ‘This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, <span class="italic">and</span> Jesus Christ whom you have sent.’</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Glory and self-giving</span></p>
				<p class="text">Recognizing this pattern makes an important difference to one’s understanding of the nature of the relationship between Jesus and the Father, and specifically of the link between the Father’s glory and Jesus’ humility. After all, the high glory of an earthly king might properly be shown by the deep bowing of his subjects. Those subjects show the nature of their monarch by providing, as it were, a <span class="italic">negative</span> image of the king’s glory: they abase themselves to show their lowliness, and so implicitly demonstrate the king’s exalted majesty. However, even in his humility, even as he points away from himself, Jesus <span class="italic">positively </span>mirrors the Father, because the Father is also one who points away from himself, allowing Jesus to speak and act for him. The Son’s self-giving picks up, repeats and returns the Father’s self-giving. Each points to the other in order to provide his own self-definition.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In John 12, Jesus says ‘“The hour has come for <span class="italic">the Son of Man to be glorified</span>. … Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say – ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, <span class="italic">glorify your name</span>.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and  I will glorify it again.” … [Jesus said], “I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die’ (vv.23, 27–28, 32–33). In John 17, Jesus says, ‘Father, the hour has come; <span class="italic">glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you</span>. … I glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. So now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had in your presence before the world existed.’ For John, the glorification of the Father’s name (that is the manifestation of God’s nature in the world), and the glorification of Jesus (the full manifestation of his proper place in God’s work in the world) happen at the same time, and at the same place: when Jesus is raised up on the cross.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-4">Exercise</p>
				<p class="text">Try reading through the Gospel of John, chapters 13—17. Pay attention to what is said or implied about the relationships between Jesus, the Father, the Spirit, the disciples and the world. See whether you think my descriptions of the patterns in the Gospels capture what is going on in that text.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">It is in line with all this that the Spirit can be portrayed in the Gospels not simply as one who turns the world toward the Father, awakening the world to the Father’s kingdom, but as one who brings the world <span class="italic">to</span> <span class="italic">Jesus</span>. In John 16.13–15, Jesus says,</p>
				<p class="quotes">But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own. … He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Instead of simply being the one who inducts men and women into the kingdom of God that Jesus announces, the Spirit can also be seen as the one who draws men and women into knowledge of the Son as the one who points us to the Father and makes the Father known, and so the one who draws men and women into knowledge of the Father <span class="italic">as</span> the Father of this Son: the Spirit is not simply the Spirit of the kingdom of the Father, but is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Once again, do not think that I mean more than I say, here. I am not trying to argue that the obvious conclusion from what I have just said is that Jesus is divine, or that the Father, Son and Spirit are equal persons in the divine Godhead. I do not think my discussion so far allows us even to know what those claims <span class="italic">mean</span>, let alone know whether they are true. All I am doing is drawing attention to another pattern in the Gospels that complements the first: a pattern in which the Father and Jesus are related in mutual deference, and the Spirit draws believers into recognition of that relationship.</p>

								<p class="text">There is a form of artistic depiction of the Trinity called the ‘Gnadenstuhl’ or ‘Throne of Grace’, which seems to have been developed in Northern Europe in the twelfth century, and became popular as the Middle Ages wore on. The Father sits on the throne of grace – the ‘mercy seat’ of Exodus 25.17 – and holds out for our attention the cross on which the Son is hanging, with the Spirit hovering above him. If you look at the Father, you cannot but see the Son whom he holds out for your attention.</p>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-6"><span class="bold">Reordered language</span></p>
				<p class="text">The second pattern I have been describing is one in which the believer’s attention is not allowed to settle on the Father alone, but is shifted to the Son. This accords with one of the strange but persistent facts about the writers of the New Testament: instead of simply talking about God, and instead of simply referring to God as Father in the way that Jesus encouraged, we find that at least some of them started talking about God as ‘the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ’, defining the Father in relation to Jesus, and that, even more striking, alongside reference to God the Father <span class="italic">of</span> Jesus, formulae concerning God the Father <span class="italic">and</span> Jesus began to become natural, and sometimes even God the Father <span class="italic">and </span>Jesus <span class="italic">and </span>the Holy Spirit. Talk about God, in other words, began to get tangled up in the web of relationships between the Father, Jesus and the Spirit. Even if ‘God’ and ‘Father’ are synonymous in much of the New Testament, this is a God who can’t be talked about truly, or fully, or appropriately, unless at the same time one also talks about Jesus and the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Good examples of the twofold pattern can be found at the start of every letter in the Pauline corpus. For example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Romans 1.7; 1 Corinthians 1.3; 2 Corinthians 1.2; Philippians 1.2: ‘Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Galatians 1.1, 3: ‘Paul, an apostle, sent by … Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead. … Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">2 Thessalonians 1.1–2: ‘To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">1 Timothy 1.1–2: ‘Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Saviour and of Christ Jesus our hope. … Grace, mercy and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.’</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Threefold patterns can be found in other passages, such as these:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Matthew 28.19: ‘Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">2 Corinthians 13.13: ‘The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Galatians 4.6: ‘And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Ephesians 5.18–20: ‘Be filled with the Spirit … giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">1 Peter 1.1–2: ‘To the exiles of the Dispersion … who have been chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with his blood.’</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jude 1.20–21. ‘But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit; keep yourselves in the love of God; look forward to the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.’</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">I am not making any claims about the <span class="italic">nature</span> of Jesus, the <span class="italic">nature</span> of the Spirit, or the<span class="italic"> nature </span>of the Father (beyond the claim that they are all characters in a set of explicit and implicit biblical narratives). I am simply noting that the Father did not remain alone at the focal point of Christian devotion, or remain alone in Christian ways of speaking about God. Quite what that says about God’s nature is a question I have yet to broach.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-7"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">In early Christianity, talk about God became talk about God as the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Talk about God regularly became talk about God <span class="italic">and</span> Jesus.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Talk about God sometimes became talk about God <span class="italic">and</span> Jesus <span class="italic">and</span> the Spirit.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-8"><span class="bold">The threefold way</span></p>
				<p class="text">Any simple description of Christian life as involving a relationship to the Father is not enough on its own. Christian life is also life in the Spirit. Christian life is also life following Jesus. It is life captivated by, upset by, embraced by Jesus – life alongside Jesus, relationship to whom is constitutive for life in the Father’s kingdom. And this same Christian life is life that has been invaded by, transformed by, overwhelmed by, the Spirit – the Spirit who draws people to Christ, and impels and enables participation in that kingdom. It is only this Christian life, which is life in the Spirit and life shaped alongside Jesus, that is really life lived on the way to the Father by the road along which this Father has made himself known. Christian life is life that is created by, and in constant movement towards, the Father who is Father of the Son and sender of the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One way of grasping these affirmations is by thinking of their negative counterparts:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christians are never so filled with the Spirit that they can dispense with being disrupted by Jesus; never so spiritual that they do not need to be judged by his self-giving on the cross: there is no getting beyond Jesus by means of the Spirit. To think otherwise is to speak of a different Spirit from that spoken of in the New Testament.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christians can have no relationship to Jesus that is not already some kind of living in the Spirit; without the Spirit making him present Jesus will recede into the past or be absent in heaven, and the believer can have nothing to do with him: there is no going to Jesus except by the Spirit. To think otherwise is to speak of a Jesus different from the risen, present Christ spoken of in the New Testament.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christians never approach so close to the Father that they can forget about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus; they can never find a place in the heart of the Father where there is no presence of the crucified and risen one: there is no leaving Jesus behind on the way to God. To think otherwise is to speak of a Father other than the ‘Father of our Lord Jesus Christ’ spoken of in the New Testament.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christians cannot rest content with looking at Jesus as a historical figure whose influence and importance is limited to one sphere; they cannot face Jesus without being faced with the question of how he reveals to us the one who is always and everywhere present and relevant, the one he called Father: there is no following Jesus without attending to the Father. To think otherwise is to think of a Jesus who is not the beloved Son spoken of in the New Testament.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christians can never so rely on the Spirit within them that they ignore the Spirit’s relation to the creation, sustaining and redeeming of the whole world; there is no keeping the Spirit to a private ‘religious’ realm; there is no Spirit without that love and justice that are the Father’s life: there is no Spirit without the Father. To think otherwise is to speak of a Spirit other than the Spirit of the kingdom of the Father spoken of in the New Testament.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christians cannot relate to the Father simply as the distant clockmaker behind the Universe, the deists’ God who has no impact upon life except in a rarefied intellectual worship; to relate to the Father is to be caught up by his Spirit into intimate, revolutionary relationship with him: there is no relating to the Father without the Spirit. To think otherwise is to speak of a Father who is not the sender of the Spirit spoken of in the New Testament.</li>

				<p class="text">‘He who has conceived of the Father, and has conceived of him by himself, has also received the Son into his mind; and having received the Son, he does not divide the Spirit from the Son, but … forms an image in himself that … is a mixing of the three in the same manner. And if someone mentions the Spirit alone, he has by this very confession received him of whom the Spirit is. And since the Spirit is of Christ and of God, as Paul says, just as he who grasps onto one end of a chain draws along with it the other end as well, so he who draws the Spirit, as the prophet says, through him also drags along together the Son and the Father. And if anyone truly grasps hold of the Son, he shall hold him on two sides: the one where he draws together his Father to himself, and the other where he draws his own Spirit.’</p>

				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">These are not meant to be restrictions by which one must abide in order to remain a member in good standing of the Christian club. They are, rather, ways of spelling out who Trinitarian theologians think they are speaking about when they speak about God. They are simply more explicit ways of stating the claims I have been exploring: that the Father points to the Son, and the Son to the Father, and the Father and the Son send the Spirit to lead people back to the Father and the Son – and that is simply who the Father, Son and Spirit <span class="italic">are</span>. For those who seek to follow the God of the Bible, the God of Jesus Christ, there is no getting away from this complex interplay.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Ecclesial and personal</span></p>
				<p class="text">There are two complementary ways of understanding these rules. In the first place, they could be thought of as a kind of Trinitarian grammar for church life, a way of checking that a church that is committed to the doctrine of the Trinity has not begun to live in misshapen ways. So, for instance, if a charismatic church becomes caught up in what it believes is a new wave of the Spirit’s work, this Trinitarian grammar yields some appropriate questions: Is this movement taking the church deeper into its devotion to Christ crucified and risen?, and is it taking it deeper in its concern for the coming of the Father’s kingdom of love and justice for the whole world? Those questions can be asked, and the church kept faithful to its Trinitarian creeds, even if there are few or none who have any technical theological expertise, or any precise knowledge of what the doctrine of the Trinity means.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In the second place, however, these rules can also be thought of on a more individual level as the grammar of a spiritual discipline, which asks the believer if she is willing to throw herself into learning the nature of God down this strange threefold path, remaining open to the call of the other two persons whenever her contemplation or practice is focused on one, and letting go of any apparently more secure grasp of God that she might have had outside of this venture.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-10"><span class="bold">Divine drama</span></p>
				<p class="text">If we were to put all this material together into a single story, it might look something like this:</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Act 1</span> The Father sends Jesus, forming and empowering him by the Spirit; this is the Father’s way of loving the world, as John 3.16 explains.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Act 2 </span>The Spirit works within those to whom Jesus is sent, helping them to recognize in him the Father’s love for them.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Act 3 </span>The Spirit works within those who recognize this love, to draw them into conformity to Jesus, so that they may face Jesus’ Father in Christlike love and obedience.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above"><span class="bold">Act 4 </span>They find that the Father to whom they look in Christlike love and obedience sends them into the world alongside Christ, as the body of Christ united and empowered by the Spirit, to love the world with Christlike love. They become themselves part of the Father’s way of loving the world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-81" id="footnote-169-81-backlink">81</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">There is a strange choreography here: a criss-crossing of movements by which believers are drawn into the pattern of relationships that holds together the Father, the Son and the Spirit. In Chapter 2 I argued that, in Christian theology, knowledge of God was not primarily a matter of having a set of correct concepts that succeeded in defining God, but was a matter of living in response to God’s call – becoming part of the movement of God’s life in the world. I argued in more detail that it was a matter of growth in love and justice, penitent recognition of Jesus of Nazareth as the guide who takes one deeper into this love and justice, and grateful acknowledgement of the <span class="italic">source</span> of the love and justice into which one was being incorporated. In this chapter, I have tried to make this a little more concrete by paying attention to some of the patterns in the New Testament. I have suggested that, for the Gospels, the journey into love and justice (into the kingdom of God) cannot simply be described as a journey undertaken with the help of Jesus and the Spirit, headed towards the Father: the ‘movement of God’s life in the world’ is more to-and-fro, more circulating and criss-crossing than that. It is a movement that involves the believer being caught up by the Spirit in the Son’s love of the Father, and in the Father’s sending of the Son. It is a dance in which each partner in turn defers to the other and brings that partner forward. Jesus hands his followers over to the Father, The Father hands them over to the Jesus, and each is involved in giving them the Spirit who draws them back towards both. It is participation in this movement that constitutes knowledge of God, according to Christian theology.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">I have not presented any of these comments and arguments because I believe that they somehow prove that the Spirit and the Son are divine, or that they somehow prove the appropriateness of talk of ‘one God in three persons’. All I have been trying to do is to display some basic patterns in the economy of salvation as it is portrayed in the Gospels and elsewhere. I have talked about broad narrative patterns that can be found in the Gospels, about particular narrative incidents in which those patterns receive a crystallized form, about discursive passages in which aspects of those patterns are directly described, and about what one could call the distinctive twofold and threefold grammar for talk about God that began to emerge in the early decades of the Christian Church. I have tried to draw all these strands together in the image of a drama in which Father, Son and Spirit are <span class="italic">dramatis personae</span>, or in the image of a dance in which they are partners.<span class="italic"> </span>And all that I am claiming at this point is that, for Christian theology, to know God is to know the God who is caught up in relationship with Jesus and the Spirit, and to know God is to get caught up in those relationships oneself – becoming a participant in the drama.</p>

				<p class="text"><span class="bold">Rublev</span></p>
				<p class="text">Probably the most famous artistic representation of the Trinity is an icon painted in around 1410 by Andrei Rublev, depicting the incident from Genesis 18 in which three men or angels come to visit Abraham at a place called Mamre. Abraham addresses the three men in the singular, as if they were one person, and then as the story goes on a strange ambiguity arises about whether Abraham is speaking with them, or with God. Medieval Christian writers, eager to find Christian doctrines secreted already in the pages of the Old Testament, often took this strange story as a hint pointing towards the doctrine of the Trinity – and the icon-painter Rublev uses it as an indirect portrait of a three-personned God. He portrays the three angels sitting at the table at which Abraham is entertaining them, and sets the direction of their gazes, and the inclination of their bodies, so as to indicate a pattern of relationships and of deference between the three. As a result, the viewer’s eye is not allowed to rest on any one of the figures, but is moved from figure to figure, following the image’s subtle choreography.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-82" id="footnote-169-82-backlink">82</a></span></p>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-12"><span class="bold">The heart of the doctrine</span></p>
				<p class="text">We have already reached the heart of the doctrine of the Trinity. The doctrine is nothing more nor less than the claim that true knowledge of God, true sharing of God’s life <span class="italic">is</span> participation in this drama – the threefold drama of the economy of salvation. The word ‘God’ simply refers to the reality that Christians come to know, and whose life they come to share, as they find themselves, in the Spirit, caught up in the Son’s love of the Father and the Father’s sending of the Son.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To know God is to be drawn into that love and justice that has its fount and origin in the Father. It is to be drawn into that love in which one is formed by being conformed to the Son, who plays out that love again in a form that one can take on. And it is to be drawn into that Christlike love that is formed within one by the working of the Spirit, who conforms one to the love that unites the Son and the Father. God’s life <span class="italic">is </span>this love, and this love <span class="italic">is </span>God’s life. God is that reality that Christians know by participating in this threefold economy of love.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Trinitarian Christians claim that to know God in this way – by relating to Father, Son and Spirit; by participating in this drama – is to know God truly. That is, this is not a stage to get beyond. It is not a preliminary introduction. This threefold economy is a pathway that leads to the immanent depths of God. These are not simply the kindergarten slopes, to be abandoned in favour of something starker and purer once Christians have reached maturity: this is, according to Trinitarian theology, the one endless threefold path by which God is truly known. God is that reality that Christians come to know truly as they find themselves caught up in the threefold economy of Father, Son and Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Everything that remains in this chapter is simply icing on this cake, and even if there should not be another word in this chapter that makes the slightest sense to you, you have, if you have kept up so far, understood the heart of the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

				<p class="text">‘An ordinary simple Christian kneels down to say his prayers. He is trying to get into touch with God. But if he is a Christian, he knows that what is prompting him to pray is also God: God, so to speak, inside him. But he also knows that all his real knowledge of God comes through Christ, the Man who was God – that Christ is standing beside him, helping him to pray, praying for him. You see what is happening. God is the thing to which he is praying – the goal he is trying to reach. God is also the thing inside him which is pushing him on – the motive power. And God is also the road or bridge along which he is being pushed to that goal. So that the whole threefold life of the three-personal Being is actually going on in that ordinary little bedroom, where an ordinary man is saying his prayers.’</p>

					<li class="bullet-list">God is the one whom Christians know as they find themselves, in the Spirit, caught up in the Son’s love of the Father and the Father’s sending of the Son.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-14"><span class="bold">Imagining God</span></p>
				<p class="text">This chapter so far has been focused on a pragmatic description of the economy of salvation, setting out the patterns of dramatic action portrayed in the Gospels, the patterns of Christian speaking displayed in the New Testament more generally, and the patterns of Christian living that respond to Jesus and the Scriptures. All of these are the kind of historical, graspable, human realities to which pragmatic language is suited.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-83" id="footnote-169-83-backlink">83</a></span> And to all this pragmatic material, I have now added one big claim in propositional mode: God is the reality that Christians know by participating in this threefold economy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">All that remains is to ask whether and how one may speak directly of or describe the God who is known in this way. What ways of speaking or thinking about God’s immanent life, if any, are appropriate to this threefold path along which Trinitarian Christians believe one must tread?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is a secondary question. After all, the primary reality of Trinitarian Christianity is not the words or images that Christians manage to deploy in order to describe God, but the ways in which their whole lives are caught up in the threefold economy of God, and so into God’s own life of love and justice. Nevertheless, this secondary question is in its own way unavoidable and necessary: if Christians do not ask what ways of thinking about God are appropriate to this economy, they are all too likely to find themselves left with ways of thinking that are <span class="italic">in</span>appropriate – ways of thinking that subtly leech support from wholehearted participation in the economy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A non-Trinitarian theologian might, for instance, suggest that Jesus and the Spirit should be thought of as purely economic realities. That is, she might suggest that Jesus and the Spirit are simply aspects of what God has done in history in order to draw people to Godself. She would suggest that they are like the rising and setting of the sun in the story I told in the previous chapter: aspects of how God relates to us, rather than aspects of who God is in Godself. In this view, it would only be the Father who is <span class="italic">true</span> God, only the Father who represents God’s immanent life. Jesus would best be thought of, she might say, as something like a prophet, one called to proclaim God’s truth; the ‘Spirit’ would perhaps simply be a name for God’s activity working within individuals and communities. Attending to Jesus directly would not, for her, be an <span class="italic">essential</span> part of attending to God; it would simply be a stage on our way to attending to God, a rung that Jesus himself would urge us to leave behind in the end.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-84" id="footnote-169-84-backlink">84</a></span> The Father, according to this non-Trinitarian, <span class="italic">is</span> God; the Son and the Spirit are simply what God <span class="italic">does</span>. God would <span class="italic">economically </span>be the Father of the Son and the sender of the Spirit, but there would be an immanent reality to God’s life behind this sending, a reality not shaped or constituted by relationship to the Son or to the Spirit. If she wanted to speak compellingly of the immanent depths of God, she might do worse than turn to the words of <span class="italic">Green grow the rushes, O</span>: ‘One is one and all alone and ever more shall be so.’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This non-Trinitarian theologian might suggest that the believer’s true relationship to God is best seen as one in which the believer faces the Father as an ‘I’ facing a ‘Thou’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-85" id="footnote-169-85-backlink">85</a></span> All other parts of the economy fall away: they lead to this relationship, but they are not essential to it. They are the scaffolding that God has provided to enable the believer to be lifted into this position.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is to this picture that the Trinitarian Christian says ‘No!’, because it is a form of imagination of God that relegates the threefold drama of the economy to a secondary, subordinate place. It imagines a form of knowledge of God <span class="italic">beyond</span> the economy. It does not allow one to say, as I did a moment ago, that ‘true knowledge of God, true sharing of God’s life <span class="italic">is</span> participation in this drama – the threefold drama of the economy of salvation’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is certainly an attractively simple, easily graspable picture of God – it is a picture that ‘comes naturally’, perhaps – but Christians are faced with a choice between holding to it, and holding to the threefold economy. For the Trinitarian, this is no contest: one must give priority to the means by which God has made Godself known, and subordinate to it one’s ability to imagine the unimaginable reality of God. Faithfulness to God’s economy requires one to break and remake one’s imagination of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Instead, Trinitarian Christianity says that it is the whole drama of the economy – the Father pointing to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Spirit communicating between them – that is the revelation of God’s immanent life. God has revealed Godself in a drama, an economy, a dance of reciprocity and deference between a Father, a Son and a Spirit. That is the way in which God has given God’s life to the world, the model God has made of Godself, and even though the immanent life of God so far exceeds our imaginations that one cannot know <span class="italic">how</span> this model is true of it, Trinitarian Christians believe that it <span class="italic">is</span>, nevertheless, a true image of God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-86" id="footnote-169-86-backlink">86</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The Fatherhood of God</span></p>
				<p class="text">Some theologians in the early centuries of the Christian church drew attention to the fact that ‘Father’ is a relational term, because a person can only be a Father if he has children. They therefore insisted, in effect, that ‘Father’ must be an <span class="italic">economic</span> name for God, naming God by the relationships into which God has entered. ‘Father’ is a term applicable only to the arrangements God has made for the salvation of the world; it can’t be used to speak of the immanent depths of God’s nature. This view, however, was eventually rejected by the wider church as heretical. Theologians like Athanasius of Alexandria replied, in effect, that Christians who believed this would have to admit that Jesus did not, by revealing God as Father, reveal the inmost heart of God. Christians would have to say that Jesus had led them only to the outer courts of God’s nature, and left them there. The immanent nature of God, God as God is in God’s Holy of Holies, would be something fundamentally different from the face that God has turned towards the world in Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Athanasius and others argued that, on the contrary, if Jesus reveals God as Father, and if Jesus really is revealing God to the world, then God must be <span class="italic">immanently</span> Father, not just <span class="italic">economically</span> Father. And yet they agreed that ‘Father’ is a relational term; it does not simply name a set of characteristics that an individual might bear on his or her own, but refers to someone who is related to another someone. So the immanent life of God can’t be thought of as being like the life of an isolated individual. It must be thought of as the life of one-who-is-always-a-Father, and so of one-who-is-always-with-another; it must be thought of as the life of a Father-and-a-Son.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-87" id="footnote-169-87-backlink">87</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The Trinitarian Christian will not, therefore, imagine herself as a believer facing the Father alone, with the rest of the economy left behind. She will make sense of herself as one being drawn ever more deeply into the choreography of the relationships between the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. She would relate to the Father as the Father of the Son, to the Son as the Son of the Father, and to the Spirit as the one who binds them into this community – and that will be her participation in the life of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To put it more simply, if God is the reality that one comes to know by participating in this threefold economy, then knowing God is more like joining a party than it is like facing an individual.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-15"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">If one is faithful to the threefold economy of salvation, God’s immanent life cannot be imagined as represented by the Father only.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The whole threefold economy is, according to Trinitarian theology, the self-revelation of God.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-16"><span class="bold">Three-personned God</span></p>
				<p class="text">The threefold economy is not, according to Trinitarian theology, simply a useful metaphor for God’s life. It is not like saying, ‘Consider the three-leafed clover: three leaves, but one plant. God is a bit like that.’ Trinitarian theology does not simply say, ‘Consider the relationships between Father, Son and Spirit in the Bible: three characters, but one economy. God is a bit like that.’ It is not a matter of an accidental or fortuitous resemblance. This threefold economy is like the pattern of lights on the CD player’s graphical display: it is a representation in our time-taking, finite, historical world of the immanent life of God – and it is so <span class="italic">because </span>it is the way in which the immanent life of God is showing itself to the world. The whole threefold economy is, according to Trinitarian theology, what God is doing in order to draw the world into God’s immanent life, and so it is what God is doing in order to draw the world into the only kind of knowledge of God available. The threefold economy is God’s self-revelation, God’s revelation of God’s immanent life. Trinitarian Christians do not simply say that God has a threefold economy, but that God <span class="italic">is</span> threefold – God <span class="italic">is</span> triune.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The threefold economy – a drama whose <span class="italic">dramatis personae</span> can only be properly identified in relation to one another – is, Trinitarian Christian theologians claim, the transcription of the music of God’s immanent life into a form that can be played on economic instruments. The Son, the Spirit and the Father as we encounter them in the economy (in history, in forms that we can grasp, imagine and learn) are like the lights on the CD player’s graphical display. In that analogy, I argued that there was some aspect of the music represented by each feature of those lights, even though the music itself utterly exceeded the visual display. In just the same way, Trinitarian theology argues that there is some unimaginable aspect of God’s life that is represented by the Father who Christians know in the economy, some unimaginable aspect of God’s life that is represented by the Jesus who Christians know in the economy, and some unimaginable aspect of God’s life that is represented by the Spirit who Christians know in the economy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">That does not mean that Christians know what those unimaginable aspects of God’s life look like, or how they work; it does not mean one can come up with a theory of how the immanent life of God is constructed, any more than the lights on the CD player enable one to grasp the realities of the music that they represent. Nevertheless, this economy represents God’s immanent life.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The incarnation of the Trinity</span></p>
				<p class="text">If the whole threefold economy is God’s self-revelation in history, then there is a sense in which we can say that the whole threefold economy is the incarnation of the Trinity. We will be looking in the next chapter at the language of ‘incarnation’ as it relates specifically to the Son, but in a looser sense it is not just the Son who becomes incarnate. Christians know the Son of God by knowing Jesus, a particular human being living in history. They also know the Spirit by means of the Spirit’s effects in history – seeing not the wind, but the leaves that the wind shakes and the trees that it bends. And they know the Father by means of a set of stories, names, metaphors and practices that are told or used or lived in history. Christians know each of the persons economically: in history, in a way that is graspable by time-bound creatures like themselves. Indeed, ‘economically’ is the only way Christians <span class="italic">could</span> know the persons. This economic Trinity is, they believe, what the immanent Trinity is doing; it is, as it were, the immanent Trinity made flesh and living in the world, so that human beings might behold its glory.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-88" id="footnote-169-88-backlink">88</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The traditional term used for what I have been calling an ‘unimaginable aspect’ of God’s immanent life is ‘person’. One must tread carefully at this point, however, because it is easy to assume that ‘person’ must mean ‘a being a bit like us’: a centre of consciousness, a being with some kind of will and understanding, a being endowed with <span class="italic">personality</span>. Yet the Greek word eventually used in the early Church’s debates about all this, the word for which our word ‘person’ is supposed to be an equivalent, was <span class="italic">hypostasis</span> – a word that in this context implies a lot less than our ‘person’. It means something more like ‘a distinguishable reality’; one might even say ‘a something’. Instead of saying ‘there is some unimaginable aspect of God’s life that is represented by the Father who we know in the economy’, I could have said, ‘There is an unimaginable <span class="italic">something</span> about God’s life – an unimaginable <span class="italic">hypostasis</span> – that is represented by the Father who we know in the economy.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-89" id="footnote-169-89-backlink">89</a></span> To say that God’s immanent life is a life of three persons is, therefore, to say no more than I have said already: that God’s immanent life is faithfully given to us in this triune economy. The threefold economy is what God is doing to make God’s life visible, knowable and shareable.</p>

				<p class="text">‘When St. Augustine came to consider the use of the word <span class="italic">persona</span> in the theology of the Trinity – a word which after all was no more Scriptural than <span class="italic">homoousios</span> – he frankly admitted that to speak of God as <span class="italic">una persona</span> would have been no less appropriate than to speak of him as <span class="italic">tres personae</span>. But some word we must have wherewith to answer the question<span class="italic"> Quid tres?</span> – “What are these three?” And because of the poverty of our human language we say that the three are Persons – <span class="italic">non ut illud deiceretur, sed ne taceretur</span>, “not because that was what we wanted to say, but so as not to be reduced to silence”. We cannot now substitute a better word, even if one were certainly available. We must continue to pray, “O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, three Persons and one God, have mercy upon us.” And perhaps it is more important that we should think of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us as a “person” – a person who can be “grieved” (Ephesians 4.30; Isaiah 63.10) by our faithlessness – than that we should be over-careful to insist that the language we use does not mean what it says.’</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Our word ‘person’ is not, however, wholly misleading. After all, we are referring to a ‘something’ in the immanent life of God that is aptly and faithfully represented by one of the <span class="italic">dramatis personae</span> in the economy – by one of the three essential, mutually-defining characters in the economic drama. So the ‘person of the Father’, for instance, is that ineffable something in the life of God that comes to the world, gives itself to the world, becomes visible and graspable and thinkable to the world, in this character in the economic drama – a character whose identity is inseparably bound up with the other two characters. To speak of that ‘ineffable something’ as a person is to say that it is a reality that is aptly given to the world in this ‘personal’ way – where ‘person’ now has the fuller meaning of ‘character in a drama’ or ‘one whose identity is defined by his or her relations to others’.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">A social Trinity?</span></p>
				<p class="text">Some theologians – proponents of a ‘social Trinity’ – suggest that it is appropriate to say directly that the immanent life of God consists of three persons in communion, using a much fuller sense of the word ‘person’. That is, they think it appropriate to imagine the immanent life of God as three thinking and acting individuals, three centres of consciousness, eternally interrelating in patterns of deference and reciprocity. I am not so sure. I cannot see how to go further than I have gone above: the persons-in-relation of the economy are, I believe, the way that the immanent life of God comes to us, is given to us, is made visible for us, and knowing those persons-in-relation in the economy is the only way of knowing God. So although I believe <span class="italic">that</span> this economic reality is the faithful and true and adequate transcription of the immanent life of God, I do not know <span class="italic">how</span> it is such a transcription. The economy is the way in which the immanent life of God is given to my thought, my imagination, my life; and so each person is the way in which <span class="italic">something </span>of the immanent life of God is given to me – but of <span class="italic">what</span> it is that is given to me, I can only say that it is the unimaginable reality that truly shares itself with me in this way. So when I say that the immanent life of God consists of three persons in relation, I am using ‘person’ in the more austere sense: three ‘somethings’ in the one divine life of God.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-17"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The whole threefold economy is, according to Trinitarian theology, what God is doing in order to draw people in to God’s immanent life.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The threefold economy leads Christians to speak of three ‘hypostases’ or ‘persons’ in God’s immanent life.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">To speak of a ‘hypostasis’ in God’s life is to speak of a ‘distinguishable reality’, a ‘something’.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-18"><span class="bold">Divine substance</span></p>
				<p class="text">Alongside ‘person’ the other key term used in classical statements of Trinitarian doctrine is ‘substance’. It sounds to modern ears as if it refers to ‘stuff’, the material out of which a thing is made. It is a translation of a Greek term (<span class="italic">ousia</span>), though, and (at least in this context) has a far less material meaning. The ‘substance’ of a thing is, to put it clumsily, ‘what it is about a thing that makes it the kind of thing it is’. So, my substance is that about me that makes me human, rather than some other kind of reality.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-91" id="footnote-169-91-backlink">91</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Trinitarian theologians wanted a way of saying that each person of the Trinity is fully God, and they used this word <span class="italic">ousia</span> to do so: God is three persons of one substance. ‘Substance’ refers, if you like, to what the three persons share.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is difficult to state appropriately. That is, it is difficult to talk about this without subtly undermining the basic points that I have been making about the doctrine. One can end up, for instance, suggesting that God’s life consists of three examples of the same kind of thing, three realities that share the same defining characteristics. And that in turn suggests that one could talk about the reality of God’s life – this substance – in abstraction from the particular distinguishing characteristics of the three examples in which one finds it embodied. If my table and my chair and my ruler are three examples of the same kind of thing (wooden things) then I can talk about woodenness (consisting of hard, organic material derived from trees) without having to talk about the particular shape of any of the examples. If I and my wife and my two children are all examples of the same kind of thing (human things) then in the same way I can talk about humanness in abstraction from the features that distinguish us four. Is that how it is with the divinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Someone might say that <span class="italic">divine </span>substance – the defining characteristics of divinity – consists, say, in being omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent and loving. And then they might say that the three persons, the three somethings in the immanent life of God who come to the world as Father, Son and Spirit in the economy, are each distinct examples of this divine kind of thing: each is an omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent and loving reality. This essential, shared nature of God – omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence and love – could therefore be discussed and understood in abstraction from the particular identities of the Father, the Son and the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That, of course, would in turn mean that one had a way of thinking about, talking about, or imagining God that got behind the economy – a way of talking or thinking that was, at least in one sense, <span class="italic">deeper</span>, more basic, than ways of thinking about God that have been formed by attention to the three particular persons and their particular relations.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If, instead, one tries to talk about divine substance in a way that is true to the basic structure of Trinitarian belief, then one will have to say that the substance of God is the <span class="italic">life</span> that the three persons share – the life that is constituted by their interrelation. So if one talks about a characteristic of the divine life like omnipotence, one will not straightforwardly say that each person is omnipotent, but rather will say that God’s way of being omnipotent is by being these three persons in relation. That is, any power that God has is always a power that has its origin in the Father, is focused in the Son and is brought to completion by the Spirit. It does not make sense to say that <span class="italic">each</span> of these is omnipotent, rather it is the power that the three have together, or that God has by being all three, that is omnipotent.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">To put this in terms that sound less like a speculative explanation of the inner workings of God’s action, one might say that the only way in which Christians fully experience the power of God in the economy is by experiencing it as a power that comes from the Father, as a power that draws the world into conformity to Jesus, and as a power that is brought to completion in them by the Spirit. It is only as a power that has this threefold economic shape that Christians know the one power of God.</p>

				<p class="text">‘Every operation which extends from God to the Creation … has its origin from the Father, and proceeds through the Son, and is perfected in the Holy Spirit … [T]he action of each concerning anything is not separate and peculiar, but whatever comes to pass, in reference either to the acts of [God’s] providence for us, or to the government and constitution of the universe, comes to pass by the action of the three, yet what does come to pass is not three things. We may understand the meaning of this from one single instance. From him, I say, who is the chief source of gifts, all things which have shared in this grace have obtained their life. When we inquire, then, whence this good gift came to us, we find by the guidance of the Scriptures that it was from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Yet although we set forth three persons and three names, we do not consider that we have had bestowed upon us three lives, one from each Person separately; but the same life is wrought in us by the Father, and prepared by the Son, and depends on the will of the Holy Spirit.’</p>

					<li class="bullet-list">This substance should not be thought of as a kind of being of which the three persons are examples.</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-20"><span class="bold">One-in-three, three-in-one</span></p>
				<p class="text">Discussions of the doctrine of the Trinity sometimes get all tangled up in analogies that try to explain <span class="italic">how</span> something can be both three and one. You may well have heard some of them: God is like a triangle (three sides, one triangle), or a clover (three leaves, one plant), or water (ice, water, steam), or river (source, stream, estuary) – and so on. I have to admit that I do not find most of these remotely helpful, because they make the doctrine sound like it is some kind of mathematical paradox. Imagining how the immanent life of God functions is not our business.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is, nevertheless, an important point behind these analogies: Trinitarian doctrine does involve holding together the threeness and the oneness of the dance of God’s life. One of the temptations that Christian theologians have identified in Trinitarian theology is the temptation to focus on the one common life that the Father, Son and Spirit share, and to neglect the specificity of the three persons involved. Even some theologians who are apparently resolutely Trinitarian fall into this trap. One of the most prominent forms of it in contemporary theology is the temptation to take the doctrine of the Trinity as the claim that God’s nature is the supreme instance of the general category ‘community’ or ‘relationship’. The doctrine of the Trinity might be thought to tell us first and foremost that God is not an isolated individual but a community, a set of persons in relationship – and, so the argument goes, we need to be just as relational, just as much a community. The doctrine of the Trinity is held to have direct and obvious consequences for combating Western individualism, or for levelling church hierarchy, or for pushing us quite clearly towards a more egalitarian and community-minded understanding of human flourishing – and all the work in these claims is done by the <span class="italic">general</span> idea of community and relationality.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is a lot of truth in such claims, and they should certainly not be dismissed out of hand. They are not, however, fully Trinitarian claims as they stand: they dwell on the general idea of God’s life as communal and relational without making it clear that this can always and only mean the community specifically of these three: the Father, the Son and the Spirit. That is, these claims sometimes lose sight (at least temporarily) of the particular persons about whom the doctrine of the Trinity speaks. If Trinitarian theologians are to speak about the nature of community, or the importance of a relational understanding of life, they must eventually do so by grounding it not in a general account of personhood and relationality, but in reflection on the life specifically of the Father, Jesus and the Spirit. To put it another way: talk about the Trinity should not ever be something different from the Bible’s talk about the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The second temptation is so to focus on the specificity of each of the persons, Father, Son and Spirit, that one ignores the one life that they share. So, for instance, one might find a Christian devotional programme that assumes that one can and should have clearly distinct experiences of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit – turning to each in turn for a different kind of relationship. Or one might find theology that assumes that when discussing some doctrine – say, the doctrine of salvation – one can treat the ‘work of Christ’ fully and completely before moving on to the distinct ‘work of the Spirit’: the two ‘works’ might be co-ordinated in some way, but they are presented as separate activities, perhaps relating to different stages of a person’s salvation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Once again, this is less than fully Trinitarian. Trinitarian theology knows the three persons only as they take their places in a life together. The Father appears in the Gospels simply as one who sends the Son and the Spirit; the Son as one who points back to Father and hands over to the Spirit; the Spirit as one who teaches about the Son and leads to the Father. These three are who they are only in relation to one another, and so to know the Son one has to know the Son-as-related-to-the-Father-and-the-Spirit, to know the Spirit one has to know the Spirit-as-related-to-the-Son-and-the-Father, and to know the Father one has to know the Father-as-related-to-the-Spirit-and-the-Son. In Christian devotion, any experience of the Son that one might have is always experience <span class="italic">in</span> the Spirit, and experience directed <span class="italic">towards</span> the Father; if it is not those things then it is not experience of this Son – and so on. Or in the doctrine of salvation, the work of the Spirit is the work that the Spirit does in drawing people <span class="italic">to</span> the Father and the Son, involving them in the life between these two. If it does not do that, then it is not the work of this Spirit. For fully Trinitarian theology, one simply cannot pull any of the three persons out of their shared life for separate scrutiny – except as a temporary and obviously artificial aid to understanding.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Perichoresis and appropriation</span></p>
				<p class="text">The Greek word ‘perichoresis’ is used to speak of the kind of unity that the three persons in the economy share, and (analogously and unimaginably) the kind of unity that the three persons of the immanent life of God share. Perichoresis is graspable in the economy: it names the way in which one cannot ultimately extract any one of the <span class="italic">dramatis personae</span> from the other two; each is what it is only in relation to the other two. The word originally meant some- thing like ‘giving place to one another in turn’, and came to mean something like ‘being what you are in and through another’ – the Latin equivalent is <span class="italic">circumincessio</span>; English translations use words like ‘coinherence’ or ‘interpenetration’. We can see what ‘perichoresis’ means in the economy – it is displayed in the patterns I described in the early sections of this chapter – but once again we have no grasp on what it means in God’s immanent life, except by saying that that immanent life aptly gives itself to us in an economy of three perichoretically related persons.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Appropriation’ is the word used to name the way in which consideration of the Trinity can start from any one of the persons. So you can start thinking about the Father, only to find yourself needing to refer to Son and Spirit in order to do justice to the Father; you can start thinking about the Son, only to find yourself thinking about the Father and the Spirit, and so on. Some doctrines have traditionally been linked to such ways of starting with one of the three. Consideration of the doctrine of creation, for instance, often involves starting with consideration of the Father as Creator. The doctrine is said to be ‘appropriated’ to the Father. If this is to be adequate Trinitarian reflection, however, such consideration will go on to include the involvement of the Son and the Spirit in creation too: creation will only be fully understood once it is understood as the one work of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-21"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The community of the Trinity is always the community of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and one should not become so enamoured of the general idea of ‘community’ as to turn away from the specific identities and relationships of these three.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The three persons of the Trinity are, for Trinitarian theologians, so defined by their relations to one another that there can be no experiences of, or claims about, or relationship to one person that does not involve the other two.</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-22"><span class="bold">It’s the economy, stupid</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-93" id="footnote-169-93-backlink">93</a></span></p>
				<p class="text">The doctrine of the Trinity as traditionally formulated does involve speaking of the triunity of God’s immanent life (or of ‘the immanent trinity’, to use the traditional phrase), and it does involve speaking of the eternal persons of the Godhead – the eternal Father, the eternal Son and the eternal Spirit. But to speak this way is not to propose some other object for one’s attention, separable from the economy – as if one might turn away, say, from Jesus and concentrate <span class="italic">instead</span> on the eternal person of the Trinity that lies behind him, or turn away from the movements of the Spirit in history and concentrate <span class="italic">instead</span> on the eternal Spirit that lies behind them. Rather, to learn to speak appropriately about God’s immanent life is to learn to see the human being Jesus – a graspable, knowable, historical, economic reality – <span class="italic">as</span> the coming to the world of the ineffable, eternal Son; it is to learn to see the Father who appears in one’s economic imaginations and words <span class="italic">as</span> the coming to the world of the eternal, ineffable Father; it is to learn to see the shakings and stirrings of the Spirit’s historical, economic work <span class="italic">as</span> the coming to the world of the ineffable, eternal Spirit. It is to learn to see the whole patterned drama of the economy, into which Christians believe all are called, <span class="italic">as</span> the opening up to the world of God’s own immanent life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">All this talk of ‘economic’ and ‘immanent’ should not, therefore, involve any scorn being poured on those who only know the economy, as if the Trinitarian theologian might ridicule their immaturity and point to the more abstract heights of knowledge available to the real experts. Instead, it insists that <span class="italic">the economy is enough</span>. Of course, one cannot (for traditional Trinitarian theology, at least) simply declare that the economy is God, full stop. That would be to reduce God to a graspable set of historical realities. Nevertheless, the doctrine of the Trinity declares that this graspable, knowable, effable set of historical realities <span class="italic">is </span>the ineffable God’s way of making Godself known. This <span class="italic">is </span>the opening up for us, Trinitarian Christianity says, of the ineffable life of God – a life that is itself something like a drama, something like a dance, something like a community. This <span class="italic">is </span>the arrival in history of the immanent life of God that one can therefore know to be an eternal circulation of three hypostases in relation – even though one does not know what ‘hypostasis’ means in this case, or ‘relation’, or even ‘three’. Never mind: whatever this immanent life is, it meets one here, and it is not <span class="italic">less</span> than what meets one here.</p>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-9-24"><span class="bold">Imagining salvation</span></p>
				<p class="text">How then are Christians to grasp the doctrine of the Trinity? It tells them that God has both transcribed God’s own life into terms that human beings can see, learn and grasp – and that God has done so not simply to <span class="italic">show</span> them that life, not simply to communicate to them, but to open that life up for their participation. It tells them that they have been invited to share the life that the Father, the Son and the Spirit share, and that when they share that community’s life they are sharing in God’s own life. It tells them not to think of a lonely god who made them to meet his need for company, but a loving community whose love overflows, and seeks others to join its delight. It suggests that the life of God is and always has been a feast, but that now it is a feast that they are invited to join: the banquet of the kingdom. And it tells them that their lives are inextricably interwoven with the Father, with the Son and with the Holy Spirit: that the same God is above them, beside them and within them; that the same God is the goal, the road and the motive force that drives them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, these are metaphors, parables and analogies rather than straightforward descriptions, but it is probably in such imaginative language, rather than in the austerities of propositional claims or even pragmatic description, that Christians best learn to grasp the nature of the economy of salvation in which they are being caught up. It is through such imaginative language that Christians might learn to glimpse, in a glass darkly, the triune face of God.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">For a fuller understanding of the Trinity, you need to know more about the contexts in which the doctrine arose, the questions its framers were asking, the practices it fitted in to.

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">There has been a revival of Trinitarian theology in recent decades, and discussion of the doctrine takes many forms. It is well worth sampling some of that variety: you can look among many others at a liberation theology perspective in Leonardo Boff, ‘Trinity’ in Jon Sobrino and Ignacio Ellacuría (eds), <span class="italic">Systematic Theology</span> (London: SCM Press, 1996), pp. 75–89; an Orthodox perspective in Vladimir Lossky, <span class="italic">The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church</span> (London: James Clarke &amp; Co., 1957), especially chapter 3, ‘God in Trinity’; an Anglican perspective in Christopher Cocksworth, <span class="italic">Holy, Holy, Holy: Worshipping the Trinitarian God </span>(London: DLT, 1997); or a Baptist perspective in James W.

It would be a good exercise to read her paper and ask whether my presentation in this chapter oversteps the boundaries that she sets.</li>

Rather the doctrine of the Trinity is a way of thinking about and relating to the unknowable mystery of God.</p>
