				<p class="text">This chapter will continue my discussion of the nature and purpose of the Church, focusing on the remaining two ‘marks’: apostolicity and holiness.

Before doing so, it is worth having some kind of picture of the <span class="italic">history</span> of the Church – the good, the bad and the ugly. Consider pausing and dipping into an accessible one-volume history, like Stephen Tomkins’s brief and witty <span class="italic">Short History of Christianity</span> (Oxford: Lion Hudson, 2005) or Justo L.

					<li class="bullet-list">Hans Küng, <span class="italic">The Church</span>, tr. Ray and Rosaleen Ockenden (London: Search Press, 1968 [German original: 1967]). A weighty and thorough examination of ecclesiology, with a streak of reformist zeal.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-1"><span class="bold">Apostolicity</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">The Church owes its existence to Jesus of Nazareth. It is called into being by the good news of Jesus, and called into being in order to pass that good news on. It is defined both by its relation to the witness that it has received (the witness passed on by the apostles – those whom Christ chose and sent out to proclaim the gospel) and by its duty somehow to perpetuate and spread that witness itself (that is, to undertake an apostolic ministry itself). To think of the Church as catholic is to think of the circulating of the gift of Christ among the members now. To think of the Church as apostolic is to think of the Church as a recipient of a gift that has been passed down in time, and that is to be handed on to the future. The Church simply <span class="italic">is</span> the community of those who receive the apostolic witness to Christ and who pass it on.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Apostolic succession</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">The Catholic theologian Hans Küng writes:</p>
				<p class="quotes">As direct witnesses and messengers of the risen Lord, the apostles can have no successors. No further apostles were called. … The apostles are dead; there are no new apostles. But the <span class="italic">apostolic mission</span> remains. … This apostolic ministry does not depend on further vocations to apostleship in the narrow sense, but depends on obedience to the apostles as the original witnesses and messengers of the Lord. As a result of the continuing apostolic mission there is, in the apostolic ministry, an apostolic succession: an apostolic succession of obedience. <span class="italic">Who </span>then are the followers of the apostles? … There can only be one basic answer: the Church. The whole Church, not just a few individuals, is the follower of the Apostles.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-322" id="footnote-169-322-backlink">322</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Nevertheless, alongside this ‘basic answer’, some churches and some theologians have argued that this general ‘apostolic succession of obedience’ is supported by a more specific one: the commissioning by the original apostles of some who would carry the responsibility of holding the Church to its catholic and apostolic mission, who in turn commissioned others to bear that responsibility, who in turn commissioned others, and so on down the ages in what is claimed to be an unbroken succession. The idea is that a continuity of <span class="italic">witness </span>is supported by a continuity of <span class="italic">people</span> – by a physical and personal handing on and entrusting across the generations from bishop to bishop and from bishop to priest, symbolized by the laying on of hands at ordination.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-323" id="footnote-169-323-backlink">323</a></span> Others, on the other hand, see little inherent connection between the two forms of apostolic succession – and so doubt the necessity, or historical existence, of the unbroken succession of bishops.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-324" id="footnote-169-324-backlink">324</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">There is a spectrum of possible ways of understanding the apostolic nature of the Church. At one end of the spectrum is the approach that says that the Church is where the reign of God, the kingdom of God, is made real in the present. It is where response to the call of God, and living out of the life of God, takes place. It is, in a sense, an ‘embodiment’ of the life of God. Of course, it does not <span class="italic">exhaust</span> God’s action: God is active anywhere and everywhere, and might turn out to have been working in all sorts of unexpected ways in unexpected places. But while it might acknowledge that, the Church’s main business is to invite people to join it. It is – even when it is marred by divisions and by sin and misunderstanding – the place where true worship takes place, where the gospel is heard and obeyed, where the learning and unlearning of God has its home on earth. The Church, in pointing to God, points to itself; ‘Church’ is understood to mean ‘the community of the true followers of Christ’. Apostolicity will be a matter of the Church preserving its identity as the embodiment of the kingdom: it preserves and passes Christ’s call to the world by being the continuation of Christ’s life – by being the body of Christ, living the life of Christ in the world.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Embodiment of the kingdom?</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘[O]ur Savior shares prerogatives peculiarly his own with the Church in such a way that she may portray, in her whole life, both exterior and interior, a most faithful image of Christ. For in virtue of the juridical mission by which our divine Redeemer sent his apostles into the world, as he had been sent by the Father (John 27.18, 20.21), it is he who through the Church baptizes, teaches, rules, looses, binds, offers, sacrifices.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘Certainly the loving Mother is spotless in the Sacraments by which she gives birth to and nourishes her children; in the faith which she has always preserved inviolate; in her sacred laws imposed on all; in the evangelical counsels which she recommends; in those heavenly gifts and extraordinary grace through which, with inexhaustible fecundity, she generates hosts of martyrs, virgins and confessors. But it cannot be laid to her charge if some members fall, weak or wounded. In their name she prays to God daily: “Forgive us our trespasses”; and with the brave heart of a mother she applies herself at once to the work of nursing them back to spiritual health.’</p>

				<p class="text">‘While Christ, holy, innocent and undefiled knew nothing of sin, but came to expiate only the sins of the people, the Church, embracing in its bosom sinners, at the same time holy and always in need of being purified, always follows the way of penance and renewal. The Church, like a stranger in a foreign land, presses forward amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God, announcing the cross and death of the Lord until he comes. By the power of the risen Lord it is given strength that it might, in patience and in love, overcome its sorrows and its challenges, both within itself and from without, and that it might reveal to the world, faithfully though darkly, the mystery of its Lord until, in the end, it will be manifested in full light.’</p>
				<p class="source">Second Vatican Council, <span class="italic">Dogmatic Constitution on the Church</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-326" id="footnote-169-326-backlink">326</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">At the other end of the spectrum is the approach that says that the Church does not point to itself at all, but always points away from itself to the activity and work of God. It does not regard itself as a place where the learning and unlearning of God are necessarily going on any more deeply or any more ‘successfully’ than anywhere else – but simply as a place where those processes are <span class="italic">named</span>. The Church is not the kingdom but the <span class="italic">herald</span> of the kingdom. Those who hold this model believe that in all sorts of places and in all sorts of ways, God is drawing people to himself by conforming them to the Son by the Spirit – but that it is only in the Church that this process is described in those terms, and only in the Church that the relation of this activity to what took place in Jesus of Nazareth is made clear. Instead of the Church as ‘embodiment’ of God’s activity (in some sense), this would be the Church as ‘witness’ to God’s activity. ‘Church’ is understood to mean ‘the community in which Christ’s name is kept alive’. Apostolicity in this view will be more a matter of the handing on of a message, the repetition of a proclamation, the keeping alive of a language, and not so much a matter of what the Church is as of where the Church <span class="italic">points</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-327" id="footnote-169-327-backlink">327</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Now the first view, the ‘embodiment’ view, at least in its pure form, seems to many theologians to risk tying God’s action too much to the Church. Its proponents risk saying that because Christ is here in their church, if you want to meet <span class="italic">him </span>then you are going to have to join <span class="italic">them</span> – and so they risk appointing themselves Christ’s gatekeepers. Yet the Christ of the Gospels was often to be found where people did not expect him: eating and drinking among sinners. And the same Christ indicated that he would be found among the needy.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-328" id="footnote-169-328-backlink">328</a></span> If the Church sees itself as <span class="italic">possessing </span>Christ, even if it intends bountifully to distribute that possession to the world, it has missed something important: when the Church goes out into the world it will find Christ already there, and will learn more of who Christ is in its encounter with those it meets.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the other hand, the ‘witness’ view, at least in its pure form, has its own problems. The core of Christian faith is to ‘know nothing but Christ and him crucified’ – to bring all one’s thoughts and habits, all one knows and does, to the foot of the cross to be judged and remade there. That, if you like, is the one thing Christians know, the one vocation they have. And while Christians can certainly trust that when they bring people and situations to the foot of the cross they will discover that the God of Jesus Christ has been at work in more ways than they could have imagined, drawing people into his Christ-shaped life in times and places far beyond the Church, that does not mean that to bring things to the foot of the cross will leave them unchanged. To name some process of learning that has been going on outside the Church as a process in which the God of Jesus Christ is active is to point to Christ as a criterion by which that learning can be judged and reshaped.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That is not the same as saying that Christians ‘have all the answers’: the Christians who point others to Christ in the expectation that those others need to be judged and transformed at the foot of the cross also point themselves to the same Christ in the same expectation of judgement. It might be more true to say that Christians are the ‘bearers of a question’: that their vocation is to point to a reality that puts all people (inside the Church and outside it) to the question.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-329" id="footnote-169-329-backlink">329</a></span> But that also means that the Church is not simply a passive witness, but is (or can be) a means by which God calls the world to ever-deeper conversion, and that there is therefore a sense in which the Church is to call people to join it – at least in the sense that it calls people to look where it is looking.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">I should also say one more thing, which muddies the waters between the ‘embodiment’ model and the ‘witness’ model. Accept, for a moment, that the church’s vocation is to ‘bear the question’ – to point away from itself to Christ, to call other people to look where it is looking, and so to call all people to ever-deeper conversion at the foot of the cross. It will only do this compellingly, only do it with integrity, if instead of simply <span class="italic">telling</span> people about Christ, it lives in motion towards him. The only convincing way of proclaiming this message is by <span class="italic">living it out</span>; the only compelling way of pointing away to Christ is by being a community that is (however fitfully and inadequately) allowing itself to be converted by conscious and constant return to the foot of the cross. To be a witness, such a community must <span class="italic">embody</span> what it <span class="italic">says</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-330" id="footnote-169-330-backlink">330</a></span></p>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The church is ‘apostolic’ because its life and faith has been and is passed down the generations.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">There is a tension between regarding the Church primarily as an <span class="italic">embodiment</span> of the life of God, and regarding it primarily as a <span class="italic">witness</span> to that life.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Embodiment and witness are nevertheless inseparable.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-3"><span class="bold">Boundaries</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">These two different ways of thinking about apostolicity align loosely with different ways of thinking about the nature of the Church’s boundaries. Two different ways of thinking about those boundaries are, quite accidentally, suggested by the two main groups or words used for ‘church’ in European languages. In most European languages, the Church, or churches, are either referred to using words similar to the English word ‘Church’ (like the Scottish <span class="italic">kirk</span> or the German <span class="italic">Kirche</span>), or words similar to the French word <span class="italic">eglise</span> (like the Welsh <span class="italic">eglwys</span> or the English word ‘ecclesiastical’).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The <span class="italic">eglise </span>words all come from the Greek <span class="italic">ekklesia</span>, which itself derives from a root meaning ‘summons’ or ‘call’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-331" id="footnote-169-331-backlink">331</a></span> The original idea behind the word was perhaps that of a gathering of people called together by a particular summons. Of course, arguments based on etymology are always shaky, and there is no reason to think that people had the details of this original meaning of the word in mind by New Testament times, but it does <span class="italic">suggest </span>one interesting way of thinking about what the definition of ‘Church’ should be. That is, one can ask whether we should think of ‘Church’ as meaning the gathering of all those who are called by God deeper into the life of God, by Christ and the Spirit. Of course, if the theology outlined in this book so far is even slightly on the right lines, <span class="italic">everyone</span> is called by God deeper into the life of God, but the idea of a gathering of those who are called implies not only a call, but some kind of response to the call as well – some kind of actual gathering together. By ‘Church’, therefore, we might mean ‘all those who respond to the call of God’ – or, perhaps, ‘all those who are shaped by the call of God; all those who are actually being shaped by the Spirit in conformity to Christ’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The picture of Church which this brief reflection might start pointing us towards is one that has the call of God at the centre, and then gathering towards that centre all those who in whatever way, to whatever degree, in whatever context, respond to that call.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">However, as I said, alongside the <span class="italic">ekklesia</span> words, there are the church, kirk, Kirche words. And the etymology of these words is more obscure. The dominant theory is that it comes from the Greek word <span class="italic">kuriake </span>or ‘Lord’s’, and is short for <span class="italic">kuriake oikia</span>, the Lord’s house or Lord’s household.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-332" id="footnote-169-332-backlink">332</a></span> I don’t want to make anything more of this etymology than a fortuitous suggestion for one way of thinking about ‘Church’, but it does hint at a different picture. Instead of focusing on the universal call of God, one could focus on the defined group (the household) of those who have a particular explicit identity: those who own a specific allegiance. If ‘Church’ means <span class="italic">kuriake oikia</span>, then it refers to the family that takes its surname from the Lord: a specific, identifiable group who have a particular name that marks them out from others. Think of Acts 11.20–26:</p>
				<p class="quotes">Some men of Cyprus and Cyrene, … on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists … proclaiming the Lord Jesus. The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord … [F]or an entire year [Paul and Barnabas] met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called ‘Christians’.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">The ‘church’ (<span class="italic">ekklesia</span>) in Antioch is made up of those who ‘turn to the Lord’ (the <span class="italic">kurios</span>) in faith; they become known by his name, as <span class="italic">Christ</span>ians: those who are named for their <span class="italic">pater familias</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The difference between these two ways of understanding the nature of the Church can perhaps be illustrated in the following way. In England, a farmer might keep sheep together in a sheep pen: an enclosure with a clear boundary, which helps keep a flock together by setting a limit around it, clearly dividing territory up into ‘inside’ and ‘outside’. In a desert, however, a farmer might not need to do this. She might operate instead by having a well, the only source of water for miles around, and assuming that sheep will have to keep coming back to the well if they want to survive. Her sheep will not need a clear boundary, and she will not need to divide territory up firmly into an inside and an outside. Instead, she will provide a centre in the knowledge that wherever they roam sheep will remain connected to it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Some models of Church suggest that it needs very clear boundaries: a clear inside and a clear outside to the household of faith, with the saved (or the faithful or the believers or the committed membership) on the inside and everybody else on the outside. You are either an insider or an outsider, even if some hover for a while on the boundary.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Other models of Church suggest that boundaries don’t matter so much as a clear centre. What you need is a sustained core of practices in which the universal call of God is repeated (perhaps worship, sacraments, preaching). The Church will then be defined by that centre, and might be rather relaxed about boundaries. There will be people in closer orbits and people further out, people who are utterly caught up in this centre and people who relate to it more distantly. There need be no neat division into insider and outsider. You might even say that everyone is to some extent an insider and to some extent an outsider – everyone has aspects of their life that line up with this central call, this central core of practices, and everyone has aspects of their life that fight against it. All that differs is how much of any individual’s life is on one side of the divide, how much on the other.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">There is one problem, however, with this description. If the clear centre that defines the Church is made up of a certain kind of corporate life – by ‘a community that is (however fitfully and inadequately) being converted by conscious and constant return to the foot of the cross’, say – then there might well have to be elements that look more like the ‘clear boundaries’ model (more like an English sheep-pen than the desert well) even in this ‘clear centre’ model. Once again, we are pushed away from thinking that there could be a straight choice between utterly distinct models of the Church, and towards a messier negotiation in the middle, pulled both ways by competing visions.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-5"><span class="bold">Embodiment: The Church as mother</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">One model of the Church that can help us think further about what it means for the Church to be the <span class="italic">embodiment</span> of God’s work is the model that sees the Church as <span class="italic">mother</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-333" id="footnote-169-333-backlink">333</a></span> To think of the Church as mother is, most obviously, to think of the Church as the bodily context in which Christians grow and are nurtured – the material and bodily mediation of God’s life to creatures. This model helps push away from ideas of the Church as a voluntary association, or as having primarily to do with the propagation of <span class="italic">ideas</span>. Any passing on of ideas from a mother to her children takes place in a context that is much more than intellectual: it has as much to do with emotions and habits and dispositions and desires; it is as much a matter of feeding and hugging and playing and walking and singing and laughing and tickling as it is a matter of telling. The Church as mother is a Church in which explicit instruction is only a small part of the story: it has as much to do with the shaping of patterns of physical, communal and emotional life – a context in which people learn ways of doing things, rhythms of speech, emotional repertoires, gut reactions, <span class="italic">and by so doing</span> learn to know and love God and to love the world God loves. This is how the Church passes on its life, how it reproduces itself. It might be that the apostolic nature of the Church is displayed in children’s groups and Sunday Schools at least as clearly as in the serious business of adult worship.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-334" id="footnote-169-334-backlink">334</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Of course, this model is not without its dangers, and rightly attracts similar criticisms to those that I levelled against the pure ‘embodiment’ end of the spectrum on page 337. When combined with some distinctly unhealthy ideologies of motherhood, it can reinforce the idea that the Church is unquestionably pure (and you may have noticed the maternal language in the passage I quoted from Pius XII). It can help powerful church hierarchies (very often <span class="italic">male</span> hierarchies) disguise and perpetuate their power by allowing them to cloak it under a fluffy blanket of motherly imagery. And it can keep members of the Church seeing themselves as infants, incapable of standing on their own two feet. It can, in other words, help reinforce ‘apostolicity’ in a form that is all about the policing of boundaries and the preservation of power.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Cyprian’s mother</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">The English theologian Rachel Muers draws attention to the meanings of this maternal language in its most prominent use in the Christian tradition. She writes:</p>
				<p class="quotes">The text that is quoted most often in later appropriations of the mother church image is the treatise of Cyprian on <span class="italic">The Unity of the Church</span>, written in relation to the Novatian heresy in the third century. … It’s in this text that the much-quoted line ‘no-one can have God for his Father who does not have the church as his mother’ appears. …<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-335" id="footnote-169-335-backlink">335</a></span> The key emphasis in Cyprian’s text is on purity. … [T]he chastity of the mother matters above all so that the father knows who his children are, and vice versa. That’s the context of the claim that ‘no-one can have God for his Father who does not have the church as his mother.’ Because the church has and maintains certain visible signs of ‘chastity’ … divine paternity, here and nowhere else, is not in doubt.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-336" id="footnote-169-336-backlink">336</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">In other words, this maternal imagery is used in Cyprian as part of a boundary-setting discourse – one whose real point is to help you see where the <span class="italic">true</span> Church is (and, by implication, to see also where it <span class="italic">isn’t</span>). And as Cyprian dwelt in particular on the apostolic succession of bishops as the key proof of ‘chastity’, his maternal imagery was also to do with making very clear in whose hands the power to define boundaries lay.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The maternal model itself, however, can suggest a rather different way of thinking about apostolicity and power, if one pays attention to the nature of the relationship between real mothers and their children, and specifically to the complexity of the <span class="italic">negotiation</span> between mother and child that starts when the child is still in the womb. The child may be receiving everything it needs to survive and grow from its mother’s womb, and in one sense may appropriately be seen as <span class="italic">part</span> of the mother – but (as mothers suffering from morning sickness, or bruised ribs, or a squashed bladder, or an anxious day waiting for the next kick might tell you) the child is also something <span class="italic">other</span> than the mother, because one of the things it has received is its own individuality. It has an ability not simply to receive from, but to respond to and act upon, its mother.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One of the clearest examples of this is the process by which a mother passes on her language to her child (the language that will be the child’s ‘mother tongue’). Think of all the games and rituals and repetitions involved, the physicality and time-taking and mess of it all. Yet, however much repetition might be involved, the child does not simply learn to parrot the mother. If that is all that the child learns, then the child has not actually learnt to speak. The child who really learns to speak its mother tongue can hold a conversation with its mother; it can answer back; it can say things she has never said. All that nurturing, shaping, correcting, insisting by which the mother trains the child <span class="italic">frees</span> that child to be a native speaker. Rather than being an image that silently ties down the boundaries of the Church, and keeps power firmly in the hands of the already powerful, this model seems to pull in a quite different direction. What might it suggest about apostolicity, boundaries and power in the Church?</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Importantly stupid parents</span></p>
				<p class="text">One of the ways in which babies learn is by being consistently treated as if they were more advanced than they are. So, for instance, the baby whose wind-induced grimaces are taken by doting parents as smiles, and responded to with delighted cooing, tend to learn to produce real smiles more quickly. Similarly, the baby is pushed towards the patterns of speech when his or her random and accidental noises are treated as if they were just on the borders of meaningful communication.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is not simply a case of praise and disapproval reinforcing or weakening a given behaviour. Parents’ responses give a baby’s ‘actions’ meaning by weaving them in to an ongoing conversation (in a broad sense). So babies don’t simply discover that smiling (for instance) is a good thing to do, they (slowly but surely) discover what smiling <span class="italic">means</span>, by learning the range of responses and reactions that it can generate – the appropriate ways in which the conversation can continue.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This means that it is very important for parents to be a bit stupid about their children – a bit too inclined to read significance into things, a bit too inclined to spot patterns, a bit too inclined to attribute intent and skill to their children. And there is something quite simply beautiful about this notion of winning a child into deeper levels of skill and interaction and communication and relationship by treating her (gratuitously) as if she were already there. And I suspect I mean that word ‘gratuitously’ quite seriously: this is, I think, a matter of grace.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-337" id="footnote-169-337-backlink">337</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-line-below">If we are to think of the Church as <span class="italic">witness</span>, we will need to move on from thinking of the Church as mother to thinking of the Church as constituted and impelled by <span class="italic">mission</span>. Mission is fundamental to the identity of the Church. In the first place, it is <span class="italic">God’s</span> mission that is central. Christians believe that God has reached out and called all people into God’s life. But this calling is not a call <span class="italic">from</span> the world – as if individuals who answered the call were plucked from their nasty surroundings and nastier neighbours so as to enjoy a solo voyage into the heart of bliss. The love of God that is expressed in God’s mission is a love <span class="italic">for the world</span>, and a love for all people – a desire to draw all people and all things into unimpeded fellowship. And if the call issued by God is a call for human beings to share in God’s love, then it is a call to become filled with the love of God for the world. The life of God is a life of love, and to be drawn into this life is to be drawn in to love – drawn to share the Son’s love of the Father and the Father’s sending of the Son. God’s mission becomes the mission of God’s people.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The mission of the Church</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘It is God’s design to gather all creation under the Lordship of Christ (cf. Ephesians 1.10), and to bring humanity and all creation into communion. As a reflection of the communion in the Triune God, the Church is God’s instrument in fulfilling this goal. The Church is called to manifest God’s mercy to humanity, and to bring humanity to its purpose – to praise and glorify God together with all the heavenly hosts. The mission of the Church is to serve the purpose of God as a gift given to the world in order that all may believe (cf. John 17.21).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">‘As persons who acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, Christians are called to proclaim the Gospel in word and deed. They are to address those who have not heard, as well as those who are no longer living according to the Gospel, the Good News of the reign of God. They are called to live its values and to be a foretaste of that reign in the world. Mission thus belongs to the very being of the Church. This is a central implication of affirming the apostolicity of the Church.’</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Now, to love another is to seek that other’s good, and the highest good that, in Christian theology, can be desired or sought for another person, is that she too be drawn into the life of God, and be made more fully herself in the process. The highest good is that she fully know herself to be loved and become fully loving herself, and reflect back to God in her own particular configuration God’s life of love.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christianity is, therefore, inherently <span class="italic">missionary</span>, if by ‘mission’ we mean that activity by which Christians are impelled and enabled by the Spirit to participate with Christ in the Father’s love of the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The primary form of mission, therefore, is simply to love people. And if we want to know what that means, we can hardly do better than remind ourselves once again of 1 Corinthians 13.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. …</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Let me simply draw attention to two words from that definition: patient and kind. First, love is <span class="italic">kind</span>. If mission is love, then at the heart of mission will be kindness – attentiveness to the needs of the other, concern about their welfare, tenderness towards them. And you cannot be kind if you do not care, and if you do not look and listen. At the heart of mission will be a serious and devoted paying of attention to others.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Second, love is <span class="italic">patient</span>. It is participation in the patience of God that is shown in God’s giving to creation its own time and space in which to be itself, to have its own way of being. If mission is, first and foremost, love, then it will not be an attitude in which the Christian seeks to cram the other into a preconceived space, making clones for Christ; it will be characterized by the desire that the other person should become fully and wholly herself in Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">To desire the fulfilment of another person means, from a Christian point of view, seeking for that other person to be drawn fully into love, because it is only in being loved and in becoming loving that a person becomes fully him- or herself. People are diminished and constricted by hatred and disordered desire; wholeness comes through love. And that may well mean that mission will also involve an element of challenge: a challenge to all that holds people (including oneself) back from love: a challenge to selfishness, a challenge to violence, a challenge to division. And so mission may well involve one in passionate outrage at injustice just as much as it involves one in considerate kindness to one’s neighbours.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-9"><span class="bold">The nature of evangelism</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘Love’ can mean many things, and can be twisted and distorted and misunderstood, and used for ulterior motives. So to desire for someone to become full and whole is to desire the <span class="italic">purification</span> of that person’s love. And this is where things can get more difficult.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Let me start with a bad model. This is the model that says there is no problem in desiring the purification of another’s love. The model that says, ‘I know what love is; it is obvious. It is an attitude I know and understand fully, and so can spread to others. I may not myself be perfectly loving, but I know how love works.’ In effect, this model says that to seek for the purification of love – my own and others’ – is for me to point to myself, or at least to my ideas; it is for me to establish myself as a criterion. My well-understood ideals are what I am spreading, and ‘mission’ is in effect the attempt to make other people like me – or at least like what I identify as best in myself. The purification of love is, in this model, something we seek for other people, but not really – at least not <span class="italic">radically</span> – for myself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A better model says, ‘No, I can’t claim to have become fully loving. I can’t claim to have understood love properly. I can’t claim to have had my love purified. All I can claim, as a Christian, is that I have been loved by one who is teaching me what love is – however painfully slow and often reversed the process of learning might be. If I am seeking the growth and perfecting of love, it will not be by pointing to myself but by pointing to the source from which I receive love and the criterion by which I learn to discern love: the cross of Christ.’ Mission will, in this model, involve not the attempt to make other people like me, but simply to direct their gaze where I direct mine, and so to learn alongside me from the same source.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This better model, however, can collapse back into the bad model. Once I have said that it is my task, in Christian mission, to point people to Christ, I can all too easily start claiming that I know exactly who Christ is and what he has to say, and am an expert on what is involved in entering into relationship with him. Once again, this substitutes something within my grasp and control, something that cannot surprise me, for the dangerous freedom of Christ, and makes mission into a process of self-cloning rather than a process in which I direct people away from myself and towards God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, to be involved in Christian mission is first of all to love others; second it is to seek for them to grow in love; and third it is to point people away from oneself and to the source and criterion by which their love and one’s own can be purified – and it is that pointing away that can be called ‘evangelism’, the passing on of the <span class="italic">evangel</span>, the gospel, the good news.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the sense just described, therefore, mission has fundamentally to do with witnessing to Christ; it has fundamentally to do with pointing away from oneself. True mission, one might say, is as ek-static as worship. In mission, it is vital for Christians not to try to control what happens, not to try to fit the other person into the paradigm of what has happened to them. In mission, too, Christians must be open to discovering something new by seeing how encounter with Christ works out for someone else. Christian mission – whether it be in forms that focus on the explicit proclamation of the Gospel of love, or forms that focus on the living out of that love among others – faces constant temptation to self-centredness, constant temptation to attempt the taming of God in whose mission one is supposedly participating. ‘Let God be God’ is a cry that needs to challenge Christian mission as well as every other aspect of Christian life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">My claim is that, if one approaches the question theologically, in the light of the kind of claims I have been exploring so far in this book, one will be pushed towards the idea that Christians are called to evangelism without arrogance, evangelism without control. They are called to love and, as part of that love, called to point to the source and criterion of their love – in their speaking and acting reflecting that source and criterion, but always in such a way as to acknowledge their own fallibility and sinfulness, and their own continued need of conversion. Evangelism, if it is to be spreading the good news of God rather than the news about oneself, <span class="italic">must</span> involve this humility.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">I don’t intend this as a concession to a cultural environment less comfortable with up-front, in-your-face evangelism than it used to be – a watering down of real, robust evangelism into something safer and weaker and lukewarm. You may disagree, and may think I have fallen into precisely this trap, but my intention is to ask how it is that one can speak about God in such a way as genuinely to speak about <span class="italic">God</span>, rather than about <span class="italic">one’s grasp </span>on God – in other words, how it is that one can speak about God without secretly speaking about oneself all along.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">I suppose one might sum this up by saying that the two aspects of Christian mission are love and worship: love that lives out, by the grace of God and to the best of one’s broken and finite ability, the life of God in the world, and worship that gives the glory to God and to God only, and points to God alone as the source of all that is true, good and beautiful.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Forms of witness</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘Witness’ can be understood in very different ways. One could say, for instance, that the only possible ‘witness’ to God’s life is the imperfect, fragmentary living of a life that reflects it, and that the Church is where one finds such new life, or holiness, or love. One could say, in a similar vein, that the only way the Church can be such a witness is by deliberately, visibly and explicitly ‘living against the grain’ of the surrounding society, trying to live as a beacon of a different form of living in the midst of an antagonistic or indifferent world. One could say that the only possible sign of God’s life is the proclamation of its truth, and that the Church is where one finds true preaching, or explicit witness to what has taken place in Christ. Only in this way is the Church’s witness to Christ, and to him crucified, kept alive. One could say that the only possible signs of God’s life are the ones instituted as sacraments (whether one thinks there are two sacraments, seven, or some other number); the Church is where one finds the proper celebration of baptism and the Eucharist – the proper holding up of these signs. One could say that the only possible sign of God’s life is the ongoing practice of worship, and that the Church is where one finds the ongoing celebration of the liturgy (or perhaps the everlasting singing of choruses). One could say that the proper way in which the Church becomes a sign is as it accompanies the activities of the world and does not preach at them but works in and around them to draw them as close to true as possible, explicitly and implicitly – working (one might say) as a chaplain. And, finally, one could even say that the only possible ‘sign’ of the redeemed life is the creation of lasting monuments to Christ – the art and architecture that outlast us, and achieve a perfection that our messy lives miss, and that the church is the building with the heavenwards-soaring steeple.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-11"><span class="bold">Holiness</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">We have yet to consider the remaining traditional mark of the Church. The Church is, the creeds say, <span class="italic">holy</span>. The root meaning of the word ‘holy’ is ‘set apart’: the Church is holy because it is set apart for God – called out of ungodly life and into godly life; earmarked for the kingdom of love and justice. To speak of the Church as holy is to speak of the Church as a community drawn by the Holy Spirit deeper into the perfect life of God. The Church is the community of those who are being killed and made alive, drawn on a journey of learning and unlearning that will transform their ways of living in the world. The Church is the community of those who are dying and rising with Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The difficulty with this claim comes from the patent unholiness of actual churches. One does not have to dig far to find in every congregation, every denomination, every strand of Christianity there is or ever has been, evidence of the failure of love and justice – of failures of nerve, betrayals of conscience, abuses of power, distortions of truth, delinquencies in care, approvals of violence, and blottings of beauty. What does it mean, in churches like these, to recite a creed that proclaims belief in a holy Church?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One might claim that the true Church – the Church confessed in the creeds – is scattered across and beyond the boundaries of the various institutional churches: that within and sometimes beyond these visible institutions there is an invisible community to which the Creed’s description does apply – the community of the holy. The work of the Spirit is not to be identified with or confined to the organizations and institutions that we call churches: the Spirit blows invisibly within and beyond them.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Visible and invisible</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">According to the 1646 Westminster Confession of Faith,</p>
				<p class="text">The catholic or universal church, which is <span class="italic">invisible</span>, consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all. The <span class="italic">visible </span>Church, which is also catholic or universal under the gospel (not confined to one nation as before under the law), consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion, together with their children; and is the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ; the house and family of God, through which men are ordinarily saved and union with which is essential to their best growth and service.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The implication is that the visible Church may contain those who <span class="italic">profess</span> the faith but are not <span class="italic">elect</span>, and that there may, extraordinarily, be those who are elect but do not profess. God’s real Church, according to the Westminster divines, does not necessarily have the same boundaries as the visible church.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-340" id="footnote-169-340-backlink">340</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">One would need to be careful, however, about pushing this distinction too far. In the first place, this way of talking can easily become arrogant (‘<span class="italic">I’m</span> a member of the true Church, the living Church of the Spirit; most of the people around me in this institutional so-called church are not.’) In the second place, this way of thinking can, as it were, let the visible institutions, the actual concretely constituted churches in which Christians worship, off the hook. If holiness is only to be looked for in the secret fellowship of the real saints through whom the Spirit blows, a fellowship scattered through and beyond the walls of visible churches, then holiness is not really something that one will expect of those visible institutions. And in the third place, the kind of holiness that is envisioned can all to easily become a purely private or individual virtue, a quality that one can make sense of only as the work of the Spirit on the individual believer, rather than a holiness that could be displayed in the organized life of an identifiable, visible community.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Some will claim that the true Church – the Church confessed in the creeds – is not the earthly institutions one sees around one today, but is the communion of saints in heaven: those who have been freed from the inadequacies and failures of this-worldly Christianity, and freed to become the kind of Church that the creeds describe.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, if this claim were simply made without qualification or supplement, it could fuel a kind of complacency. By putting off the description that the creeds give until heaven, it makes it harder for Christians to hear it as a challenge to the state of the churches here on earth in the present. One could, however, make the claim a little more subtle by claiming that this true, eschatological Church is a community into which present, worldly churches are being invited and drawn. The Church, one might say, is both holy <span class="italic">now</span>, and <span class="italic">not yet </span>holy: whatever holiness it has now it has as a foretaste and a promise of the holiness that it will have. To confess the holiness of the Church in the Creed is, in this perspective, to acknowledge holiness as the identity that God holds out for the whole Church, individually and corporately. The ‘not yet’ of this holiness is seen both in the sinfulness of individual Christians, and in the sinfulness of the churches to which they belong: in the failures of love and justice in individual lives, but also the failures of love and justice in the organization and arrangement of the churches’ institutional lives.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To confess that the Church is holy, then, is not (or should not be) a doorway to complacent satisfaction with the current state of the Church’s life: it is the confession that the Church is not yet what it will be and should be. It is a credal confession that therefore coheres with ‘confession’ in the other sense of the word: with the penitent acknowledgement of failure, and prayer for God’s assistance in becoming holy – whether it is practised as spoken confession to a priest, as liturgical prayers of contrition, or as the individual’s prayers of penitence. To say that holiness is a mark of the Church is to say that such penitence or confession is a mark of the Church.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Nevertheless, this focus on penitence as a mark of the Church should not let one accept too easily the sinfulness of the Church as an inevitability. The motor that drives this penitence is a recognition that it is proper to the Church to be holy – and therefore that an unholy Church is a contradiction in terms, an offence against nature. The credal confession of the holiness of the Church is a way of saying of the unholiness found in the life of the Church: this should not be, it does not belong, it has no place, it cannot simply be accepted or overlooked. The Church must be marked by holiness – by loving and just action within itself and towards the world. Wherever the Church is not marked by love and justice it is failing to be the Church.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Donatism</span></p>
				<p class="text">The Donatists of fourth-, and fifth-century North Africa believed that only the holy, only the blameless truly belonged in the Church, and specifically that the ministry of bishops and priests who fell from blamelessness became invalid. Donatists would, for instance, rebaptize anyone who had been baptized by someone whose ministry they regarded as invalid. They flourished in times when the persecution of Christians was still a present reality or a vivid memory, and they could identify all too easily in the ranks of the Church some who had buckled under persecution, handing over Christian Scriptures to be burnt.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-341" id="footnote-169-341-backlink">341</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Their most formidable opponent was Augustine of Hippo. He argued that the Church in the present would always be a mixed reality, and that unholiness is found inside it just as holiness is found outside it.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-342" id="footnote-169-342-backlink">342</a></span> Its holiness does not come from its own absolute purity, but from Christ – and the Church lives not by its own holiness but by his, witnessing to him, passing on his message, and celebrating the sacraments that he instituted.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-343" id="footnote-169-343-backlink">343</a></span></p>

					<li class="bullet-list">To confess the Church as holy is not, however, simply to talk about an invisible or eschatological Church rather than the present, visible, institutional churches.</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-13"><span class="bold">Institution and fellowship</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">Another approach to the issues that we have just been exploring can be found by comparing two more ‘models of the Church’. The first model is of the Church as <span class="italic">institution</span>. This is the model that sees the Church fundamentally as an ordered and clearly defined society, in which life is lived in explicit relationship to God. Someone who favoured this way of thinking might say that those who have embarked on the journey deeper into the life of God recognize that they have a fundamental allegiance, a deep orientation, that is at odds with the ways of the world: they find themselves to be citizens of another country, foreigners who don’t truly belong in the world as it has come to define itself. And they recognize that citizenship of this ‘heavenly country’ should define every aspect of their lives – not just their individual habits and affections, but their ways of organizing and regulating social life. And the only way they can be true to that citizenship and the demands that it makes is by building in the midst of the world an alternative society – an outpost of that heavenly country of which they are citizens, an outpost that runs (as far as is possible in this foreign territory) according to the rules of the heavenly country. Of course, because those who know themselves ultimately to be citizens of this heavenly country also remain for now part of the world (and because they are called to minister to the world) they will inevitably also remain part of their worldly countries, of worldly institutions and societies. Their true citizenship will sit rather strangely alongside their worldly citizenship, and, just as with any foreign enclave within a host nation, there will be endless debates about how this dual citizenship is negotiated. But fundamentally the Church will, as far as possible, be an alternative society, with alternative arrangements, an alternative education system, alternative power structures, alternative politics, even an alternative economy – sitting strangely spread out among the various worldly countries in which its members are found.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Critics of this way of speaking suggest that, while it has some important insights, it unconsciously adopts too much language and too many ideas from worldly societies, and so corrupts the gospel. So, critics might say that the kinds of power structure and hierarchical organization, the kinds of discipline, the kinds of boundary-marking and policing that are promoted by proponents of the ‘institution’ model of the Church are the ways of the world, and are not appropriate ways to respond to the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is a model that (according to its critics) does not – and cannot – recognize the strange ways in which God is working in the world. Once again, we are back to the ‘embodiment’ model, and its familiar problems.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The second model is of the Church as <span class="italic">spiritual fellowship</span>. This is more or less the opposite of the institutional model. The core idea is that the Spirit, who draws people to God alongside Christ, cannot be bound by any formal structure or institution. The Church can only be the free association of those who find that the same Spirit is impelling them, the free association of those who recognize one another as fellow travellers. The Spirit is one who breaks through all conventions, all rules, all habits, to breathe new and deeper life – and although people constantly let the life into which the Spirit is leading them atrophy and solidify into structures that have more of the flesh in them than they have of the Spirit, the Spirit retains the power to break through these structures afresh and take people deeper into the life of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The dangers with this model are perhaps as obvious as its strengths. It is important for churches to allow for the iconoclastic work of the Spirit showing them that their present understanding, their present way of doing things, their present structures and habits have become idols. Yet there is also a danger of a deep irresponsibility in this model of the Church. Just as Paul took the Corinthians to task for allowing their ecstatic experiences to lead them away from the difficult Gospel of Christ, away from love, so there is a danger that in apparently ceding control to the deep, inward prompting of the Spirit, Christians can actually be ceding control to their own whims. Unless there are ways in which the apparent promptings of the Spirit can be tested and their authenticity discerned, unless there are checks and balances in place, ways of being called to account by the wisdom of others, past and present, those involved risk heading off into the realm of ‘each person doing what is right in his or her own eyes’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-344" id="footnote-169-344-backlink">344</a></span> The potential for power trips of one kind or another is no less present in this model than in the hierarchical institutional model.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Although it is by no means inevitable, this model of the Church has also sometimes led to other forms of irresponsibility. It has sometimes gone hand in hand with a form of escapism, where the Church is taken to be a realm in which Christians leave all the problems and questions of the world behind, and are taken deeper into a realm of powerful personal experiences. The patient working out of what it means to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ in the midst of the world – the idea that there might be social, political and institutional implications and a calling to costly service in pursuit of these implications – can sometimes be abandoned in favour of a search for the right kind of feeling.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The tension between these two models is one that we have met before. When discussing the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, I spoke of the Spirit as the source of just and proper order, who enables individuals to contribute to the building of well-ordered life: the Spirit as a Spirit of Wisdom. Set alongside that, however, I set a picture of the Spirit as a disruptive influence, who challenges the unjust order of things, and names idols for what they are: the Spirit as a Spirit of Judgement. This tension cannot be resolved by picking one side over the other: both are the Spirit’s sanctifying work, and both models have something important to say about the nature of the Spirit’s Church.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-14"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Church is an alternative society in the midst of the world.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The Church is the community of those impelled and enabled by the Spirit of God.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">These two descriptions need to be held together, despite the tension between them.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-20-15"><span class="bold">Any given Sunday, again</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">What would it mean to confess the ordinary church that I described at the beginning of the previous chapter as one, holy, catholic and apostolic? Well, in the first place, worship stands at the heart of this church’s distinctive life: songs and sacraments are the most obvious things that happen when people gather in this building as church. Worship is what makes this a church rather than another village social club. And the words of the liturgy, of the hymns, of the Bible and of the sermons keep the focus of that worship firmly on the God of Jesus Christ. This church is one because it worships one God. Of course, this church’s worship is also marked by distraction, by occasional dreariness, by all sorts of imperfections and inadequacies. Worship is, nevertheless, simply what this church does: it is who we are.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This church is also ‘now and not yet’ holy. It is holy now, in all sorts of rather ordinary ways: it is made up of people who would not otherwise spend time with each other, learning to get along; and the people in it care in various ways and to various degrees about the life of the church and the life of the wider community within which it is set, and they concern themselves with how best to make a difference, how to care and comfort and support and encourage and challenge. There is nothing very dramatic about this holiness, and it is easy to imagine all sorts of ways in which this church could do more, and to identify all sorts of ways in which it fails at holiness – but still, concern with this kind of holiness, care about it, is part of what this group of people does: it is part of what this church is. And it is also a context in which the ‘not yet’ of holiness is acknowledged: it is a context in which people regularly hear from Bible passages and sermons challenges and calls to holiness, and it is a context in which there are regular liturgical acknowledgements of our failures and inadequacies – regular opportunities for repentance.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">To stand in this church on a Sunday morning and confess ‘I believe in one, holy … Church’ may be to proclaim belief in an eschatological fulfilment towards which this church points only partially and hesitantly; it is also, however to give a description of the visible life of this church that is partial and ambivalent, but nevertheless <span class="italic">true</span>.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">I have not, in my discussion of the Church, discussed the role of ordained ministers within it. It would have been possible to treat that role under the heading of ‘unity’, and seen it as primarily a sacramental role; or under ‘holiness’, and seen it primarily as the pastoral nurture of godly lives; or under ‘catholicity’, with the ordained minister as representative of the congregation to the wider Church and the wider Church to the congregation; or under ‘apostolicity’, and seen it as primarily associated with the transmission of teaching; or in a number of other ways.
