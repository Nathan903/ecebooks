				<p class="text-line-below">This chapter is a continuation of the previous chapter, on creation. I continue to ask what it means for Christians to see the world in which they live as a world caught up in the threefold economy of salvation, being drawn into participation in God’s life. Elaborating themes already introduced in Chapter 7, I will be exploring God’s ongoing care for creation: God’s sustaining, animating and guiding work. I will also be exploring the nature of human freedom in this world – and taking a glance at what a lack of freedom looks like. Note, however, that I am not yet going to treat in full the question of suffering and evil, and how they can exist in a world that God creates and guides – that is a topic that will get a chapter of its own later on.</p>
				<p class="text-line-below">I’m going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">introduce the traditional threefold division of providence into <span class="italic">conservatio</span>, <span class="italic">concursus</span> and <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that God’s providential care for creation is a necessary condition for human freedom;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">argue that true human freedom depends upon God’s guiding of the world into truth and love; and</li>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Is it possible to believe that God is present and active in everything that happens? If so, how does that presence and activity show itself? To put it another way, is God in <span class="italic">control</span> of the day-by-day course of events? If so, how does that control show itself? What difference would it make to live life with a firm conviction of that presence or control? Jot down some brief notes on your answer to these questions.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">When I checked just now, ‘doctrine of creation’ brought up 115,000 hits on an internet search engine; ‘doctrine of providence’ just 14,000.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-164" id="footnote-169-164-backlink">164</a></span> And while a large number of the sites in the creation search were impassioned popular defences of the doctrine, the sites in the providence search are rather different. Have a glance through a few now. There is no need to go into great detail; just get a flavour.</li>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-1"><span class="bold">The one who sustains</span></p>
				<p class="text">The <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span><span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-165" id="footnote-169-165-backlink">165</a></span> defines providence as ‘The action of providing; provision, preparation, arrangement’, ‘anticipation of and preparation for the future; “timely care”; … prudent or wise arrangement, management, government, or guidance’, and hence in theological contexts as ‘The foreknowing and beneficent care and government of God …; divine direction, control, or guidance.’ The doctrine of providence is the doctrine of God’s ongoing care for creation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It might be tempting to think that the doctrine of <span class="italic">creation </span>describes God’s initial action in setting the world going, while the doctrine of <span class="italic">providence </span>treats God’s subsequent actions in tending (directing, controlling, guiding) what God has made. However, I have already argued that the doctrine of creation cannot be confined to beginnings, but speaks of God’s intimate <span class="italic">ongoing </span>presence to the whole created order, so the distinction between creation and providence cannot be quite as clear cut as that. It is more accurate to say that discussion of providence will involve us looking at the subject matter of the last chapter again, but from a slightly different angle. We will be asking, in effect, ‘What difference does the divine presence to the whole of creation make?’ In particular, can one meaningfully say that events in the world are guided or shaped or directed by this presence?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The doctrine of providence is often discussed under three Latin headings: <span class="italic">conservatio</span>, <span class="italic">concursus</span> and <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> – God’s conservation or sustaining of creation, God’s concurrence with or accompanying of creation, and God’s governance or steering of creation.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-166" id="footnote-169-166-backlink">166</a></span> These three topics, taken in order, lead one step by step away from the questions and perspectives of the last chapter, with <span class="italic">conservatio</span>, the first, adding least to material I have already covered, <span class="italic">gubernatio </span>most.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian theology does not claim that God lit the blue touchpaper that started everything going, and then retired to a safe distance to watch (perhaps having read the warning in the Firework Code: Never go back to a lit firework<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-167" id="footnote-169-167-backlink">167</a></span>). Rather, the doctrine of creation affirms that the world continues in existence only because God actively and constantly upholds and sustains it – only because God <span class="italic">conserves</span> it in being. (You may recall that I also touched on this theme back in the chapter on the Spirit’s work, when I looked at those Old Testament passages that speak of possession of God’s spirit as a prerequisite for the continued life of all creatures.) This conserving, sustaining work of God can sometimes be imagined in dramatic, mythological terms as God holding back the forces of dissolution and nothingness, preserving a space in which ordered existence is possible by holding back the sea of chaos.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-168" id="footnote-169-168-backlink">168</a></span> More often it has simply been pictured as God holding the whole world in the palm of God’s hand.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-169" id="footnote-169-169-backlink">169</a></span> In somewhat less pictorial and metaphorical mood, it can be thought of as the expression of God’s constancy and faithfulness, giving continued and reliable existence to the world. However it is expressed, though, the central thought remains the same, and is simply a repetition of the idea at the heart of the doctrine of creation <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span>: the whole world, at every moment, depends utterly and only upon God for its existence.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This discussion of <span class="italic">conservatio</span> begins to tip towards the next heading, <span class="italic">concursus</span>, as soon as one asks what it means for God faithfully to hold in being something that is <span class="italic">not</span> God. One can only speak of there being things that are not God if those things have some kind of continuity and integrity of their own. After all, if one were to imagine God bringing into being nothing but a constant flicker of instantaneous and unconnected tableaux, one might speak of God’s self-expression, or of God’s generativity and creativity, but it is hard to see how one would justify talk of God creating something <span class="italic">other</span> than Godself. Conversely, as soon as one talks about God creating something other than Godself – as soon, in other words, as one talks about creation <span class="italic">ex nihilo </span>or <span class="italic">conservatio</span> – one is saying that God gives creaturely realities some kind of connectedness, some kind of extension, some kind of <span class="italic">nature </span>of their own. And that brings us to <span class="italic">concursus</span>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The Elohim</span></p>
				<p class="text">In <span class="italic">The One Tree</span>, one of Stephen Donaldson’s fantasy novel sequence <span class="italic">The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</span>, the protagonists visit the land of the Elohim, beings whose creative work is just such a flicker of instantaneous and unconnected tableaux: ‘Birds flew overhead, warbling incarnate. Cavorting in circles, they swept against each other, merged to form an abrupt pillar of fire in the air. A moment later, the fire leaped into sparks, and the sparks became gems – ruby and morganite, sapphire and porphyry, like a trail of stars – and the gems wafted away, turning to butterflies as they floated.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-170" id="footnote-169-170-backlink">170</a></span></p>
				<p class="text">This is not creation, it is self-expression; it does not bring into being any reality with sufficient continuity to count as a being <span class="italic">other</span> than the creator.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-2"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The doctrine of providence speaks of God’s continual care for and involvement in creation.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">It is traditionally discussed under three headings: <span class="italic">conservatio</span>, <span class="italic">concursus</span> and <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list"><span class="italic">Conservatio</span> has to do with God’s holding creation in being, sustaining its existence.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-3"><span class="bold">The one who accompanies</span></p>
				<p class="text">The world that God holds in being is not a static sculpture, and for God to hold the world in being means more than that God ensures that the same things exist from moment to moment. The world is a dynamic system, and the elements within it are active: they act upon other elements and are acted upon in turn. This is the form that the interdependence of creation, its connectedness and structure, takes. If God holds this kind of world in being, then God does not simply sustain each element in being, but sustains them as active.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Imagine that the world were an intricate orrery – one of those mechanical models of the solar system in which the planets rotate on their axes and move sedately around the sun, and the moons move around the planets. The planets and moons only turn and move when the whole model is connected to its power supply. The power from this supply enables each part of the model to do its own thing, and all the parts to mesh together into a working whole. To speak of God’s <span class="italic">concursus</span> is to shift from thinking from God simply as the maker of this orrery, or as the owner of the room in which it is kept; it is to think of God as the power supply: the one who ensures that each of the parts is able to ‘do its thing’. God is the one who energizes and impels all the parts of the model, and so animates the model as a whole.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below"><span class="italic">Concursus</span> literally means ‘coming together, concurrence’, but one can translate it in this context as ‘accompaniment’: God’s providential action accompanies the activity of God’s creatures, energizing it and empowering it; God underwrites the activity of God’s creatures. Without God’s concurrent activity, there could be no creaturely activity; with it, creatures can do what they do. God acts in all the acts of God’s creatures.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Primary and secondary causation</span></p>
				<p class="text">The traditional terms used at this point are ‘primary causation’ and ‘secondary causation’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-171" id="footnote-169-171-backlink">171</a></span> The words appearing in front of me on my computer screen do so thanks to a complex combination of causes: the tapping of my fingers on the keyboard, the operations of the computer, the workings of the screen. Yet this whole process only works, according to Christian theology, because God holds each part of it in being and sustains the proper activity of each part. God sustains my fingers in being, and sustains them <span class="italic">as</span> fingers, doing their fingery thing. God sustains the keyboard in being, and sustains it <span class="italic">as</span> a keyboard, doing its keyboardy thing. At a deeper level, all the countless electrons and neutrons and protons whose dance sustains the activity of fingers, computer and screen are held in being <span class="italic">as </span>electrons and neutrons and protons, and their proper activity is simply the way that God consistently and faithfully holds them in being <span class="italic">as</span> active. All that I might say about the activity of fingers, computers and screen, or about the electrons, neutrons and protons that are their constituents, comes under the heading ‘secondary causation’; all that I say about God’s activity as the enabling context for all this comes under the heading ‘primary causation’.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">When an electron does its electron thing, when a tree does its tree thing, when a sun does its sun thing – when any creaturely reality acts or moves in the way that is proper to it, that is (according to Christian theology) thanks to God’s concurring activity. God enables and animates all creaturely activity: that is part of what it means to say that the world depends, entirely and at every moment of its existence, upon God. God is active in all creaturely activity as its sustaining and enabling context.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This idea becomes more complex, however, once one starts thinking about <span class="italic">human</span> action. What does it mean to say that my activity is a result of God’s concurring or accompanying activity, or that God is acting in my acts? Consider the relationship that a novelist has to her characters. Clearly, anything that those characters do is something that the novelist <span class="italic">writes </span>them as doing; if she doesn’t write it, they don’t do it. But it will only be a good novel if she writes in such a way that the characters’ actions are really <span class="italic">theirs</span>: if they fit with and flow from the characters’ history and dispositions, and the circumstances in which they find themselves. If the novelist has shown us in detail the inner life of her characters, the actions they perform should emerge from that inner life; they should <span class="italic">belong </span>to the characters. So the actions in the novel are, in one sense, the characters’ actions; in another sense they are of course the novelist’s action: she acts in their acts. These two kinds of activity are not in competition because they are not on the same level – rather, the novelist’s action is the context for and the sustaining of the characters’ actions.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-172" id="footnote-169-172-backlink">172</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The two Fernand Mondegos</span></p>
				<p class="text">In Alexandre Dumas’ sprawling nineteenth-century novel, <span class="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>, there is a character called Fernand Mondego. Or rather, the name ‘Fernand Mondego’ is bandied about <span class="italic">as if </span>it applied to a single character. The hero, Edmond Dantès, is betrayed by his rival in love, a man called Fernand Mondego. But when Edmond returns as the Count of Monte Cristo to exact his revenge, the man called Fernand Mondego against whom he directs his schemes is all but unrecognizable as his earlier betrayer. Robin Buss, the translator of the recent Penguin edition, notes that Fernand has changed ‘from the brave and honest Spaniard with a sharp sense of humour, whom we meet in the early chapters, to the Parisian aristocrat whose life seems to have been dedicated to a series of betrayals. Fernand … seems to confirm a criticism of Dumas and of popular novels in general, namely that <span class="italic">they tend to sacrifice character to plot</span>.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-173" id="footnote-169-173-backlink">173</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Dumas knew the roles that he needed Fernand to play, and did not trouble himself to make those roles emerge convincingly from the interaction between Fernand’s history, disposition and circumstances. He did not succeeded in this case in creating an independent character, because the actions attributed to ‘Fernand’ are too much driven by Dumas’ own needs – his plot needs. For Dumas to have created and sustained a consistent character would have meant his accepting that he could not simply impose whatever plot he wanted; it would have involved a kind of self-imposed constraint upon Dumas’ own action, a willingness to act only through the action <span class="italic">appropriate </span>to his character.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">The doctrine of divine <span class="italic">concursus</span> is the claim that, in sustaining the world in being, in giving it its own integrity and continuity, God writes human activity like a novelist writing a novel. This doesn’t mean that God curbs and controls human activity, constraining it to fit God’s plan regardless of what human beings themselves want, any more than a good novelist curbs and constrains the activity of her characters. Rather, God’s providential activity writes the world in such a way that people’s acts can emerge from the interaction between their history, disposition and circumstances. God acts, and his act gives the world the kind of continuity and integrity that allows us to speak of real characters and their action. God acts in<span class="italic"> </span>all human acts.</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">To speak of God’s <span class="italic">concursus</span> with creation is to speak of God as active in the acts of God’s creatures – enabling, empowering and supporting creatures as active.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Classic Christian theology claims that God is active in all human acts – enabling, empowering and supporting human beings as active.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">God is seen as giving the world the kind of continuity and integrity that allows us to think of human beings <span class="italic">as</span> acting.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-5"><span class="bold">Concursus and freedom</span></p>
				<p class="text">This way of talking about the relationship between divine and human activity always raises questions about human freedom. Does this affirmation of divine <span class="italic">concursus</span> imply that human beings are simply puppets in God’s play? If we are characters written by a divine novelist, does that mean that we are not really free to do as we choose?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">These worries are often given focus by the question, ‘Could I have done otherwise?’ If God has written the novel of my life, and has written the present (rather dull) chapter in which I got up this morning and started typing this chapter after breakfast, did I really have the freedom that I thought I had – freedom to do something different? Could I not have decided to take the morning off? Could I, perhaps more realistically, have decided to carry on tinkering with the previous chapter, rather than starting on this one? I certainly believed that I had such freedom, and I went through a process (albeit a brief one) of deliberating about what I should do. But if this is all a story that God is writing, was I constrained to do what God had planned?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is worth noting that the question, ‘Could I have done otherwise?’ is an odd one, even if I don’t bring God’s providence into the picture at all. If I am thinking about possible external constraints upon my action, I certainly want to be able to say, ‘Yes, I could have done otherwise’, and simply mean that nobody and nothing forced me. I did not receive a letter threatening me with bodily harm should I not start work on this chapter. Not was I suddenly aware that, despite a decision to waste time playing <span class="italic">Luxor 2</span>,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-174" id="footnote-169-174-backlink">174</a></span> some mysterious force impelled my fingers to start typing this chapter instead; there did not seem to me to be anything forcing my hand.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If I think about <span class="italic">internal</span> constraints, however, the picture is rather less clear – and the purchase of the question ‘Could I have done otherwise?’ is much weaker. I don’t really think, for instance, that I could have decided to take the morning off – I would have felt too guilty. If I take all my habits and dispositions into account, I do not think it makes sense to say ‘I could have taken the morning off.’ Only if I were somebody different, with different ideas and priorities and feelings, could I have done that.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But what about a less drastic example? What about my decision not to spend time polishing the previous chapter and instead move on to this one? I could have made the opposite decision without it being out of character. I made the decision I did, however, because of the particular state of mind I was in this morning, the particular things I was thinking about, the ideas and feelings and preferences that happened to be floating through my brain at the time. If I ignore all those, then of course I could have chosen to do something different. Given all those, however, this is what I chose. And that is, of course, what I mean by saying that the decision was <span class="italic">mine</span>: it emerged from my thoughts, impressions, feelings, and preferences at the particular moment when I took it. If I could be put into <span class="italic">exactly </span>the same frame of mind, down to the very last detail of unconscious leaning or conscious distraction, I certainly hope that I would decide the same thing. If I did not, it would show that the decision wasn’t really something that emerged from my deliberation, from <span class="italic">me</span>, at all. It would show that it was something that <span class="italic">happened </span>to me, out of the blue, entirely beyond my control. If I want to claim that I acted freely, I have to claim that I could <span class="italic">not </span>have done otherwise, all things considered.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In other words, if I am to see my actions as mine, I certainly need to be able to believe in an absence of external constraints, pressing on me from outside so as to ‘force my hand’. I also, however, need to be able to believe that I determine my actions – that my actions emerge reliably from who I am at the relevant moment, and what I am thinking about, and all the detail of the state I am currently in. I need to be able to believe in the continuity between me and my action. When the doctrine of <span class="italic">concursus</span> says that God writes my action like a good novelist, it is precisely this latter that is being affirmed: God writes the world such that characters’ actions can emerge properly from who they are and the circumstances in which they find themselves. Far from being a denial of human freedom, the doctrine of <span class="italic">concursus</span> declares that it is only God’s providence<span class="italic"> </span>that ensures that humans <span class="italic">can</span> act freely. It is only because God gives continuity and integrity to creatures by acting in all that they do that it makes sense to talk about free creaturely action at all.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-7"><span class="bold">The one who steers</span></p>
				<p class="text">When one shifts attention from <span class="italic">conservatio</span> and <span class="italic">concursus</span> to <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>, even more questions arise. The word originally referred to the steering of a ship by a helmsman, and it is used to talk about the ways in which God is steering or guiding the world towards a goal. One might be tempted to say that it is only with the discussion of <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> that one finally reaches providence proper.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One should be cautious, however, about how one approaches this topic. In the first place, one should recall discussion from the very first chapter about the ‘foolishness’ of God. If one starts thinking of God as some kind of despotic ruler, who either now or in the future will start violently whipping the world into shape, one has ceased to think about the God of Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Christ has shown the world what God’s action looks like when it is made flesh; they believe that in Christ one may see that God is not a God of violent imposition, but of love. Whatever Christians say about God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> must be consistent with this: God will be no less Christlike in God’s steering of all things towards their ultimate goal than God was in the incarnation.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Hollywood endings</span></p>
				<p class="text">We are deeply conditioned to reject the Christlikeness of God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> – and one of the agents that has conditioned us is the Hollywood film. In film after film, the goodies (however meek, reluctant and pacific they may have been) are finally pushed to the point where they must unleash some storm of violence in order to overcome the baddies, and restore good order. Think of <span class="italic">High Noon</span>.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-175" id="footnote-169-175-backlink">175</a></span> Gary Cooper’s Will Kane, now married to Grace Kelly’s pacifist Quaker, Amy, plans to resign from his post as marshal, until he hears that the notorious criminal Frank Miller is returning to town with his men. Alone and unsupported by any of the good people of the town, Kane shoots two of Miller’s men, and later kills Miller himself – but the third of Miller’s men is killed by Amy, who has swapped her principles for a gun in order to save her husband. It is hard to see how she could have done otherwise; in the end, only violence will serve.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Imaginations formed in this tradition have trouble holding to the Christlikeness of God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>. In the end, we suspect, only violence will serve – and sin and suffering must go down in a hail of bullets.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">One should also not forget what has been said about <span class="italic">conservatio</span> and <span class="italic">concursus</span> the moment one turns to <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>. Christian theology cannot think of God’s steering work by picturing God on one side struggling with recalcitrant creation on the other. The continuity and integrity of creation – its resistance to arbitrary imposition – is also the act of God. To put it another way, the world’s lack of constant and complete transparency to God is itself God’s act, because God creates and sustains a world with its own continuity and momentum, not a glove puppet that would simply be an extension of God’s own being.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Lastly, one should recall some of what I have already said about the end that God has for the world. In the chapter on the Spirit, and in the last chapter on creation, I described that end as ‘creation being itself’ – as creation becoming a symphony of praise to God, given a share in God’s life by becoming what God made it to be. When I discussed incarnation, I argued that Jesus’ transparency to the will of God was identical to his being fully human. But if the end that God has for creation, its sharing fully and unimpededly in the life of God, is like this, then one can’t think of God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> as an <span class="italic">imposition </span>upon creatures or creation as a whole: a squashing of creation into a shape that is not naturally its own. Rather, the divine <span class="italic">gubernatio </span>in which Christians trust will better be thought of as God’s freeing of creation to be itself.</p>

				<p class="text">The understanding of freedom that I need in order to take this idea further is a stronger one than I was using on pages 195–6, where people would count as free when they were free from external constraints, and able to act in accordance with their present states of mind.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The easiest way to understand the stronger meaning of freedom is by considering how someone who was free from external constraint, and able to act in accordance with his or her present state of mind, might nevertheless be anything but free. In John Fowles’s strange novel, <span class="italic">The Magus</span>, the central character, Nicholas Urfe, encounters the reclusive millionaire Maurice Conchis and finds himself caught in a lengthy and bizarre psychological game that Conchis is playing.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-176" id="footnote-169-176-backlink">176</a></span> Most of the time, Urfe is able to act in a way that would count as free according to the definition I used above: he is left free to do what his deliberations and inclinations suggest to him that he should do in the circumstances. At each stage, however, he finds that Conchis has elaborately set him up: that his deliberations and inclinations have been so shaped by the half-truths and lies that have been told to him, and that the circumstances in which he makes his decisions have been so stage-managed, that his apparently free actions simply follow a bizarre script invented by Conchis.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The unfreedom of Nicholas Urfe is only an extreme case of a much more general kind of constraint. For all of us, the ways in which we see the choices available to us, and the ways in which we find ourselves leaning towards one or another, are deeply and irrevocably shaped by what we have received from others. I am the person that my parents have made me, my schooling, my friendships, my marriage, my children, my reading, my conversations, the films and television programmes and plays that I have seen. Some of that I will be able to track explicitly; much more of it will be a matter of undetected subterranean influence, subtly tilting me towards paths I might not otherwise have taken. The basic building blocks of this are pretty easy to see: it would not take Hercule Poirot to detect by looking at the path I take through life that I am recognizably English, recognizably someone born in the second half of the twentieth century, recognizably middle class, recognizably educated. A keener eye might spot that I am not just English but a southerner; not just born in the second half of the twentieth century but in the 1970s; not just middle class but some kind of upper middle; not just educated but university-educated. Those things will show themselves subtly and unavoidably in the things I say, the ways I dress, the company I keep, the possessions I own, the jokes I tell, the books I write. And those are simply the bluntest and broadest of the ways in which I have recognizably been influenced by my upbringing and situation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">What I think of as my free action turns out to be no less scripted than Nicholas Urfe’s supposedly free action – scripted in my case not by reclusive millionaires but by my parents, my teachers and my peers. I may, much of the time, be free to do as I desire – but my desires themselves are not chosen but inherited, and shaped by all the circumstances of my life.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Fashion and freedom</span></p>
				<p class="text">When I go shopping for clothes, I am supposedly exercising real freedom – the kind of freedom that, in our world, is held up as a paradigm of all freedom. I am presented with multiple possibilities, and nobody forces me to choose any particular one: I buy this pair of black trousers, but I could equally well have done otherwise. We can imagine various forms of constraint that might affect me – a lack of money, perhaps, or a work culture that dictated closely what I must wear, or a need to impress people by choosing clothes that I think they would like rather than the clothes I would choose if left to my own devices. As it happens, I think of myself as fairly free from those sorts of constraints. I am genuinely free in the clothing choices that I make.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Or so it seems. When I go into the shop and pick out what looks good to me, what seems desirable to me, I will choose something different from what I would have chosen ten years ago. My tastes have changed, and I am attracted by different things now. That in itself is not a problem, except that I find that the way in which my tastes have changed is roughly parallel to the ways in which millions of other people’s tastes have changed. I am not a person very concerned with fashion (just ask my family, friends and colleagues) but I find that the clothes I like now are recognizably clothes of the noughties, just as the clothes I liked ten years ago were recognizably clothes of the nineties. Without any desire to be fashionable, and so without any sense that fashion is an external constraint pushing me in directions I do not want to go, I find that by some means changes in fashion have subtly changed my desires. As the fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) says to her dowdy and cynical assistant Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) in <span class="italic">The Devil Wears Prada</span> – and might say to me, ‘It’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-177" id="footnote-169-177-backlink">177</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">In my clothes purchases, when I am supposedly a free consumer, I am in part playing out a script written for me by the changing fashions of my world. Advertisers and trendsetters have (at least in part) scripted my supposed freedom for me – and that is only the beginning of the lack of freedom that is hidden within my apparently free choices of clothes.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-178" id="footnote-169-178-backlink">178</a></span></p>

				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">Why are you reading this book? Try to think through some of the different factors that led to your decision to do so, or that made you the sort of person for whom doing so made sense. Do you think there was, in your decision to read it, any freedom <span class="italic">beyond </span>all those factors?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">All this is, of course, part of what it means to be a creature. Nothing about me is my own creation <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span>. And if I only count as free that which is undetermined, uninherited, unshaped by circumstance, unscripted by other people, then, yes, freedom will turn out to be an illusion, and my search for <span class="italic">that</span> kind of freedom will in fact turn out to be an impossible attempt to escape creatureliness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That is not, however, the only way of thinking about freedom. I might accept that I am inevitably and irrevocably dependent, and that my ability to see what is possible and what is desirable in any situation is not something I invent for myself. But it might still be possible to distinguish between inherited ways of seeing what is possible and desirable that are false, and inherited ways of seeing that are true – or at least between ways of seeing that are fals<span class="italic">er</span> and tru<span class="italic">er</span>. And it might also be possible to distinguish between inherited ways of seeing what is possible and desirable that turn me into a puppet for someone else’s interests, making me a means to their ends, and those that do not – or at least between ways of seeing that are more and less subordinating.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Once one has abandoned the idea that <span class="italic">real</span> freedom can be captured with the question, ‘Could I have done otherwise?’, or with the model of the consumer self standing in front of a range of affordable supermarket choices, it turns out that the only real kinds of freedom available to me as a creature are being freed from delusion, and being freed from subordination to another’s interests – freedom from distorting, destructive and demeaning forms of dependency, not freedom from dependency <span class="italic">per se</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is what I am hoping for if I speak of God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> as the freeing of creatures to be themselves. Insofar as it is directed towards creatures like me, God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> is the process by which God teaches me the truth, or dis-illusions me, stripping me of the delusions that bind me to falsehood – and is the process by which God makes real in my life God’s pure love for me, a love that does not subordinate me to anybody’s interests, because God has no interests. That is true freedom, and the only kind of freedom available to creatures.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The point about the purity of God’s love is a crucial one – and repeats a claim I made in the last chapter. The Christian doctrine of creation claims that God did not <span class="italic">need</span> to create: creation should not be seen as serving God’s interests, scratching God’s itches or meeting God’s needs. It is not a stage in God’s self-realization. Rather, Christian theology understands creation as a gratuitous and free act of a God whose Trinitarian life is already complete in itself. God creates out of delighted joy: bringing creation into existence for it to be itself. God’s love for the world is therefore seen as a completely pure love: a love without interests, a love without ego or selfishness. And it is because God has this kind of love for the world that God can be the source of real freedom in the world. Only dependence upon one who unselfishly desires one’s flourishing can be a <span class="italic">freeing </span>dependence.</p>

				<p class="text">To learn to see the world as the theatre of providence is to learn to trace hints and signs of real freedom, truth and love – but also to learn to see where apparent freedom is really a disguise for constriction and distortion. Look at the babble of language and image amidst which we live. What is being said in all that about who we are and what we are for? What stories are being told about the world and human life? Which stories seep into us and shape our perceptions, our desires and our actions? What are the scripts by which our lives run?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Consider the following exchange, which takes place in Dodie Smith’s <span class="italic">I Capture the Castle</span>, chapter 7:</p>
				<p class="quotes">‘You can only be a gentleman if you’re born one, Miss Cassandra.’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘Stephen, that’s old-fashioned nonsense,’ I said. ‘Really, it is. And by the way, will you stop calling me “Miss” Cassandra?’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">He looked astonished. Then he said: ‘Yes, I see. It should be “Miss Mortmain” now you’re grown up enough for dinner parties.’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘It certainly shouldn’t,’ I said. ‘I mean you must call me Cassandra, without the “Miss”. You’re one of the family – it’s absurd you should ever have called me “Miss”. Who told you to?’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘My mother – she set a lot of store by it,’ he said. ‘I remember the first day we came here. You and Miss Rose were throwing a ball in the garden and I ran to the kitchen door thinking I’d play, too. Mother called me back and told me how you were young ladies, and I was never to play with you unless I was invited. And to call you “Miss”, and never to presume. She had a hard job explaining what “presume” meant.’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘Oh, Stephen, how awful! And you’d be – how old?’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘Seven, I think. You’d be six and Miss Rose nine. Thomas was only four, but she told me to call him “Master Thomas”. Only he asked me not to, years ago.’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">‘And I ought to have asked you years ago.’ I’d never given it a thought.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-180" id="footnote-169-180-backlink">180</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">In this extract, the relationship between Stephen and Cassandra is deeply shaped by class. A little later, she says of her sister Rose, ‘I know that she thinks of him as – well, as a boy of a different class from ours’ and adds ‘Do I think it, too? If so, I am ashamed of such snobbishness!’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-181" id="footnote-169-181-backlink">181</a></span> But whether she is embarrassed by it or not, the fact is that class <span class="italic">does </span>have a role in their relationship, and does affect the way in which she sees him and he sees her. Before this incident, she has never really questioned that.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Cassandra lives in a world where ‘class’ is like a part of the landscape. Everyone acknowledges it, and few people question it. Stephen himself believes that it is an <span class="italic">inherent</span>, natural feature of the world: you are either born a gentleman or not, and there is nothing you can do about it. He thinks it quite natural and proper that it should shape the way one relates to other human beings, and this belief that it is natural and proper is deeply ingrained in him. He has been being taught it at least since he was seven, and it is a view of the world held in place by such small but pervasive things as the fact that he always calls Cassandra ‘Miss’ and Thomas ‘Master’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So, here we have a deep-seated way of seeing the world, which most of the time is simply not questioned, and is assumed to be natural and quite unalterable. It is passed on in part by means of various customs and practices, and it deeply shapes the relationships between people, affecting the way in which power and status are distributed in relationships.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We also have, on Cassandra’s part, someone who has been taught to believe in egalitarian ideals, but who is slowly realizing that the way in which she sees the world and other people is not as free from this deep-seated sense of class as she might have believed. She becomes determined no longer to let it shape the way she sees and feels: she determines to attack the specific customs that hold it in place (Stephen’s calling her ‘Miss’), and she worries away at the ingrained ‘snobbishness’ that she now, for the first time, sees in herself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This is a perfect example of ‘ideology’ and ‘ideology-critique’. An ideology is any way of seeing, thinking about and talking about the world that is pervasive in a particular society or community. It is any such pervasive way of seeing the world that deeply shapes the relationships between people, particularly relationships of power and status, and that the people concerned mostly see as being inevitable, unalterable and natural – or fail to ‘see’ at all. ‘Ideology’ can also refer not just to the pervasive way of seeing the world, but to the various customs and practices by which that way of seeing is inculcated and passed on – the whole educational apparatus that gets people seeing the world in that way in the first place, and the practices that keep it in place once it is there.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">‘Ideology’ is sometimes used in a neutral way, when it simply refers to any deep-seated pervasive way of seeing the world shared by a particular community or society, whether they are good and truthful ways of seeing the world or distorting and destructive. More often, though, the word has negative connotations. On the one hand, ‘ideology’ has a negative ring to it if the focus falls on the fact that a pervasive way of seeing the world is wrongly being assumed to be natural and unavoidable and unquestionable; there’s at least a whiff of deception and falsehood about that. On the other hand ‘ideology’ is used particularly for those pervasive ways of seeing the world that help keep social inequalities in place – like the class difference between Cassandra and Stephen, or like racism, or sexism, and so on.</p>

				<p class="text">This weekend, buy a newspaper that comes with a glossy lifestyle magazine. Read a selection of articles, and see if you can hazard an ideology critique along the lines I have suggested.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">When it comes to more subtle examples than the one I’ve been working with so far, ideology critique can be a far more complex and difficult process. Imagine beginning to tease out what is going on in our society’s ways of advertising, for instance, or in Australian soap operas. What do they train us to see as natural, inevitable and right? In what ways do they imprison us? What stories do they tell us about ourselves and our world – and how do those stories differ from what the Christian gospel tells us? After all, if God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> is understood as God’s freeing work, this is one of the arenas in which it will operate: bringing to judgement the distorting scripts that shape our lives.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-12"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">To understand God’s providential work, which is the source of freedom, it is important to understand our lack of freedom.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Ideology critique is one way of unmasking the constricting scripts by which one’s life is run.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-13"><span class="bold">Providence in the world</span></p>
				<p class="text">If God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio </span>is God’s freeing work, then it is identical to the economy of salvation. ‘<span class="italic">Gubernatio</span>’ is simply another word for the work of Christ and the Spirit by which the triune God draws the world to Godself, freeing it to be itself. In other words, the subject matter of the doctrine of providence turns out to be nothing other than the same subject matter that I have been presenting all along, especially in the chapters on God, on the Trinity, on incarnation and the Spirit; all that has changed is the particular direction from which I am questioning that same subject matter.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The question now is this: When Christians say that God draws the world to Godself by Word and Spirit, what are they saying about the way in which God’s action appears in the world and shapes the world? How does talking about God doing this to and for the world relate to the regular patterns of activity and relationship – the chains of cause and effect, the uniformity of natural processes – that Christians can see in the world around them, which they understand as upheld by God’s sustaining and accompanying work, and which are their normal means for explaining how and why things happen?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I argued, in my discussions of <span class="italic">conservatio </span>and <span class="italic">concursus </span>that the continuity and integrity of creation, its power of self-determination, should be seen as God’s act. Nevertheless, God has clearly been seen in Christianity as ‘steering’ creation towards an end, even if that steering is seen as the overcoming of all that distorts and constricts creation, and even if the end is imagined to be creation freed to be itself. How does this goal-directed steering mesh with the continuity and integrity of creation? If the world proceeds entirely according to the orderly causal patterns, the laws, that are proper to it, what room is there for saying that God guides or steers or impels or draws it to some particular goal?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There are various models that one might turn to – ways of thinking about the continuity and integrity of creation that might help one think how it could be open to God’s steering work. The simplest is the idea that, from time to time, God’s purpose for the world leads God to suspend the normal rules by which it works. This is what, in recent centuries, people have tended to mean by ‘miracle’: some break in the chains of cause and effect that normally bind the world together, when something happens that would not or could not otherwise have happened: divine discontinuities in the creaturely order.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-184" id="footnote-169-184-backlink">184</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">There are some ways of talking about this possibility that seem to run counter to the involvement of God in creation’s normal ordering. That is, God is sometimes portrayed as a divine tinkerer, who has set this great machine of the world going, but who now sees that it is not quite running on course, and so reaches in to make adjustments. At very least, God’s gubernatorial work seems in such a picture to be opposed to, or discontinuous with, God’s conserving and concurring work. At worst, this seems to be a God who is absent whenever the world is running as normal.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">There are, however, ways of taking this rule-suspension possibility that don’t fall into the same trap. Consider a political constitution. It might have rules about how the ordinary regularities of political life are to be suspended at times of particular crisis, in order to preserve the most basic structures and activities of the society whose constitution it is. It may be that at such times of particular crisis one will be able to see at work the deepest commitments that underpin the constitution, commitments that are normally tacit. Just so, some would say, if there are times when the ordinary regularities and continuities of creaturely life are suspended, that is only because the deeper patterns of God’s creation are running in those moments counter to the surface regularities that we normally think of as creation’s unbreakable laws. These breaks or discontinuities do not, as it were, represent God suspending the rule of law and reverting to arbitrary diktat; rather they represent the unexpected and temporary visibility of the <span class="italic">deepest </span>regularities that God has, in God’s patience and faithfulness, given to creation. It is in such miracles, some might argue, that the real nature of creation’s continuity and integrity is most clear, because those deep continuities have to do precisely with creation being ordered towards its fulfilment in God’s life. Creation’s constant and pervasive orientation to that end sometimes cracks the surface web of efficient causality that we think of as the laws of nature.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-185" id="footnote-169-185-backlink">185</a></span></p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Efficient and final causes</span></p>
				<p class="text">The philosopher Aristotle identified four different kinds of ‘cause’ – although his use of that term was rather broader than ours tends to be.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-186" id="footnote-169-186-backlink">186</a></span> Roughly speaking, he was identifying four different ways of answering the question ‘Why is that thing what it is?’ Consider a chair. The ‘material cause’, according to Aristotle, is the stuff out of which it was made, the stuff that has been worked on and changed in order to make the chair: the wood. The ‘formal cause’ is the shape or definition that has been give to the wood: it has been made into a thing with a back, a seat, and legs or a pedestal – all the elements of something chair-shaped. The ‘efficient cause’ is the power that has produced the change in the wood – in this case a carpenter with the knowledge of how to work wood, and the tools with which to shape it. The ‘final cause’ is the end or goal for which the chair was made: it is a thing for sitting on.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In modern science, the focus has been squarely on efficient causality: a change occurs in a system because some force acts upon that system. A planet’s trajectory is pulled into a curve by gravity; the water boils because heat is applied; I move my fingers because electrical impulses are sent down nerves to trigger contractions in my muscles.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The claim that I am exploring is that the laws of efficient causality that govern the universe rest upon deeper laws of <span class="italic">final </span>causality that specify what this universe is for – and while those deeper laws require that the laws of efficient casuality reign undisturbed most of the time, it is possible that from time to time those deeper laws require the suspension of efficiency.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Some theologians, however, would argue that we don’t need to assume any such suspension of the laws of nature in order to claim that God is drawing the world towards a particular goal. They note that, on present understanding, the natural laws or regularities that structure the universe appear to have some ‘give’ in them. Quantum mechanics has shown us that events do not follow one another in chains of rigidly determined causation, but are probabilistic: that is, there is a probability that the current state of a system can give rise to a given future state, a probability that it will give rise to different future states, and no way of predicting absolutely which will happen. The appearance of apparently rigid determination in the natural world is due to the unimaginably small scales at which these probabilistic processes operate. Any event that is large enough for us to take notice of in the normal course of things is therefore composed from vast numbers of these probabilistic events. Throw a die once, and you are quite likely to get a 1 or a 6; throw it a thousand times and your average score is going to be pretty close to 3.5. Throw it many billions of billions of times, and your average score will be overwhelmingly likely to be so close to 3.5 as to be identical, for all practical purposes. It is, therefore, no paradox to note that quantum mechanical theories, far from making accuracy and precision impossible, can actually give rise to astoundingly accurate and precise predictions. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics does appear to describe a world in which, at some level, the same initial conditions can give rise to multiple different futures, and – as some theologians have eagerly suggested – it might therefore be possible for God to influence outcomes without disturbing the laws by which creation runs. And the level of freedom allowed to God for such influencing is much larger than one might expect: God can, as it were, make all the countless billions of dice in a given game turn up 6, so that something utterly unheard of happens at the scales of time and space with which we are familiar, even though nothing extraordinary, nothing rule-breaking, is happening with any of the tiny quantum components of that event.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Once again, this suggestion can be taken in a variety of ways, with at one end of the spectrum images of God choosing at particular times and places to intervene in the otherwise normal running of things in order to push the outcome in a particular direction, and at the other end of the spectrum the suggestion that the quantum mechanical laws that govern the universe rest upon a deeper set of consistent and faithful divine intentions and commitments that actually shape <span class="italic">all </span>quantum mechanical events, normally very subtly, sometimes quite blatantly.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As well as the idea that God suspends the laws of nature from time to time, and the idea that those laws have enough ‘give’ in them to allow God to shape their outcomes without breaking them, there is another idea, a little more difficult to convey. This is the idea that, even if the laws were rigidly deterministic, and even if God did not break them at any point, God might nevertheless have the freedom to shape the outcome to which those laws point. Consider someone doing a Sudoku puzzle. He or she fills in the 9 <span class="Symbol">×</span> 9 grid of numbers so that each of the digits from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row and in each column of the grid, and in each of the nine 3 <span class="Symbol">×</span> 3 sub-grids of which the larger grid is composed. Working with the grid, with these rules about how it must be filled in, and with the scattering of digits already filled in by the setter, the successful puzzler works out the unique way in which the rest of the grid <span class="italic">must </span>be completed. The grid, the laws and the initial conditions absolutely determine the final outcome. Suppose, however, that one of the initial digits filled in by the setter were to be erased. The confused puzzler might now find that there were several different ways in which the grid could be filled in, each of which fully obeyed the laws of Sudoku, and each of which abided by the other initial digits placed by the setter. The fixed initial conditions and the rigid laws would no longer completely determine the final grid, and the puzzler would be free to choose which outcome she wanted, according to her own whim – choosing, say, the grid in which her favourite number appeared in the top left corner. The constraints of the laws and the initial digits would leave enough freedom for the puzzler to set her own extra constraint.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A theologian might claim that God’s decision to create the world was something like the setting and solving of such a Sudoku puzzle. God, it might be claimed, chose to create a rigidly law-governed world, and set Godself various constraints upon the world that was to be created (it must give rise to living beings capable of love, say; it must contain one human life that fully displays the life of God in creaturely form – and so on). And God might have discovered that there were multiple possible worlds that met all these constraints, just as there are multiple solutions to a Sudoku puzzle with one initial digit erased. And so this God would have the freedom to set extra constraints, choosing to bring into being one of these worlds that was in some other respect desirable – choosing the one that led to the goal that God had in mind, say, or choosing a world in which more faithful prayers happen to be followed by chains of events that look like answers than in any of the others. The world thus brought into being would be completely, deterministically law-governed, but God would nevertheless have chosen its shape in some detail.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This is, of course, a deeply anthropomorphic and mythological analogy. Nevertheless, the central idea is that a creator who in some sense has the freedom to choose the laws by which the universe will run, and to set the initial conditions upon which those laws will operate, might consistently be said to have the freedom to shape the world that is the outcomes of those laws, even if those laws are rigidly deterministic. It is not necessary to think in anthropomorphic fashion of God examining a set of possible worlds, deliberating about them, and then choosing – solving the Sudoku puzzle of creation, as it were (and in the chapter on evil and suffering, we will see some reasons for rejecting such a picture). Nevertheless, this analogy does perhaps show us that it is a mistake to think that God’s creative bringing into being of even a completely law-governed world necessarily prevents us from talking about God’s shaping, steering work: God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Miracles</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘Miracles’ are normally taken to be events that cannot be explained by natural means, or whose natural explanation is so overwhelmingly unlikely that other explanations must be sought.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-187" id="footnote-169-187-backlink">187</a></span> Debates about such miracles have tended in modern times to focus on whether miracles are possible, whether sufficient evidence can be gathered to justify belief that a particular event was a miracle, and on whether miracles count as good evidence for the existence of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The discourse of explanation and evidence that is the main context for modern discussions of miracle was not nearly so central before the seventeenth century or so. Of course, miracles were understood to be ‘wonders’ – to be astonishing, unexpected and amazing. But they were also understood to be ‘signs’, and the emphasis often fell not on how they could be explained, or upon their evidential value, but upon what they communicated or showed: the power and glory and love of God for God’s creatures.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If one wanted to retrieve these pre-modern discussions of miracle, one might say that a miracle is any event that dramatically and forcefully anticipates the kingdom of heaven, any event that dramatically and forcefully shows Christlike life being formed in the present, whether or not the event has a natural explanation, however likely or unlikely. Such events will not necessarily do anything to provide evidence for sceptics of the existence of God, even if for Christian believers they are doorways to deeper knowledge of God.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Having set out these possibilities (and without any claim that my list is exhaustive), I should lay my cards on the table. I must admit that I am an agnostic about this particular question. I can see some of the fascination that comes from exploring these theories – but I do not see that I have any place to stand from which I could make an informed judgement about whether and how God’s <span class="italic">gubernatio</span> works. As a Christian, I believe I am called to place my trust in God and in the future that God has for the world; I believe (as I shall elaborate in a short while) that I am called to pray in faith in all situations, calling upon God’s aid; and I know that I stand in a tradition that has frequently and unashamedly talked about God responding to such prayer, God shaping the course of specific events and the course of the world in general, a God of intervention and interaction. I do not, however, have a clear sense of what all this amounts to, or of what sense to make of it all. The one exception that I would make is that (for reasons that I touched on briefly, and that I will explore more fully in Chapter 10) I think I am pushed much more to those accounts that speak of a constant, faithful underlying pattern to God’s action in and towards the world, lying beneath the regularities that science investigates, rather than towards a more anthropomorphic picture of God considering what to do, how to respond, whether to act, in each and every situation. That in itself, however, does not help me choose between these three models, or even to say if any of them are anywhere near the right lines.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">On the one hand, I am aware that I live in a world of closely meshed interdependences, chains of efficient cause and effect. I am aware that I rely upon the world having this kind of structure every time I think or act, and expect the world either to make reliable sense, or expect my action to make a predictable kind of difference. I switch on a light switch, and place my trust in the regularities of the electrical world as investigated and tied down by generations of scientists and engineers.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-188" id="footnote-169-188-backlink">188</a></span> When the light fails, I change the bulb, or check the fuse, or call in an electrician, and show at each step that in practice I believe that at least this bit of the universe runs according to well-understood laws. At another level, I acknowledge the multiple ways in which I am formed and shaped by the world around me, and can only think and act because of what I have inherited from others. I am aware that even at those times when I think I am acting independently and freely, I am doing so in ways that are incontrovertibly dependent upon ideas and habits and skills that I have learnt, and that I am simply playing out again deluding stories about freedom and independence that are passed around in my culture. I believe myself to be, in other words, wholly part of creation, and so wholly and unreservedly wrapped in chains of finite dependency upon all the other creaturely realities that have formed my context since the moment of my conception.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And yet, despite acknowledging this lack of freedom, I trust that God has this whole interconnected web of creation, of which I am simply a part, in hand – and that God is drawing it to Godself, and freeing it for fulfilled, godly life. I trust, in other words, that the whole web of creaturely interdependence is itself dependent upon God, and that this deeper, infinite dependence somehow shows itself in and through the course that all those finite dependences take. I trust in particular that the future that God has for the world already appears in glimpses and hints in the midst of the world, and I trust that I am being given eyes to recognize those glimpses and hints, to recognize and share in Christlike love, and so to begin to be free.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet I do not know how this works, nor expect to know, even though I do think I can understand enough to see that I am not simply believing the impossible when I believe all this. Instead of explaining the mechanisms by which finite and infinite dependency relate, all I can do is to look for, learn to recognize, and try to point to, Christlike love and godly freedom wherever they appear, and live in such a way as to trust that this love and freedom are not simply one more variety of random froth churned from the chaotic waters of the world, but are the fingerprints of God’s saving <span class="italic">gubernatio</span>.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-14"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">God’s governance might involve the breaking of the natural laws that govern the universe – or their suspension in favour of deeper laws.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">It might involve the exploitation of ‘give’ in those laws.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">It might involve something akin to the freedom to choose the constraints that order the world.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Trust in God’s providence does not, however, require a firm answer to these questions.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-14-15"><span class="bold">Asking for God’s help</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">The nature of this trusting agnosticism might become clearer if I examine a central example: intercessory and petitionary prayer. Although the terms are frequently used interchangeably for any kind of prayer in which one asks for God’s help, ‘petitionary’ is sometimes reserved for prayers in which one asks for God’s help for oneself (or perhaps one’s closest family and friends), ‘intercessory’ for prayer in which one asks for God’s help for some other person or people. The crucial question in our context is whether and how God <span class="italic">answers </span>such prayers. Are Christians to think of God hearing their requests, and then (sometimes) intervening in the world in order to bring about something that would not otherwise have happened?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Liturgical intercession</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Formal liturgies often contain some kind of intercession. One of the most famous is the following from the Book of Common Prayer.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-189" id="footnote-169-189-backlink">189</a></span></p>
				<p class="quotes">O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us.</p>
				<p class="quotes">And grant us thy salvation.</p>
				<p class="quotes">O Lord, save the Queen.</p>
				<p class="quotes">And mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Endue thy ministers with righteousness.</p>
				<p class="quotes">And make thy chosen people joyful.</p>
				<p class="quotes">O Lord, save thy people.</p>
				<p class="quotes">And bless thine inheritance.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Give peace in our time, O Lord.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.</p>
				<p class="quotes">O God, make clean our hearts within us</p>
				<p class="quotes">And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">What does a prayer like this assume about the way that God relates to the world, and the way that God works in the world? What would one have to believe in order to say this prayer with integrity? After all, it includes petitions for ‘salvation’, for ‘joy’, for ‘righteousness’, for ‘clean hearts’ and for the presence of the Holy Spirit; it describes God’s action as ‘hearing’, ‘blessing’, ‘giving’, ‘saving’ and ‘fighting’; and it involves prayer specifically for one person (‘the Queen’), for a distinct group (‘ministers’), for the church (‘thy chosen people’), and for the world more generally (‘peace in our time’). What kind of answer must one believe possible in order to pray this prayer with trust and hope?</p>
				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">If you find yourself in a church service any time soon, spend some time listening to all that is said or sung, and identifying ways in which God’s aid is called on. What kind of picture of God’s ability to govern or steer the world is painted in the service as a whole?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The easiest answer to give is that the prayer obviously changes something, because it changes the person praying, and is (or can be) part of the process in which that person is drawn deeper into the life of God. The prayer can be seen as a process in which the person praying learns to stand towards situations in the world as God stands towards them: to be called out of preoccupation and self-centredness, to learn to see the situation against the backdrop of God’s love and so to learn to see what is wrong as a constriction or distortion of the flourishing that God desires for the world, and to learn to share the divine desire for that flourishing to be unimpeded. Such prayer can be an apt expression of protest against all in the world that stands in the way of love, and it can be an embodiment of the trust that no place or situation or person has finally escaped from the hand of God, and that God has the power to redeem even the darkest tragedy. If one pictures God’s love as a stream pouring over the world, then intercessory prayer might be seen as a matter of aligning oneself with the flow of this stream, being turned by it to face the world that God loves.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Does such prayer change the situation for which one is praying, however? Of course, if it is a situation over which the person praying has some influence, the changes in him might lead to changes in the situation. But what happens when the situation is beyond such influence or control?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In one sense, Christian theology has consistently declared that prayer does <span class="italic">not</span> directly change the world. It is not effective <span class="italic">in and of itself</span>; it is not a technique for getting things done, or a form of productive effort by which human beings can achieve things. All prayer is directed to God, and petitionary and intercessory prayers are calls upon God to act, to save, to help. If such prayer ‘works’, it does so because the God upon whom it calls works, not because the prayer itself is a tool in the hands of the person praying.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">If I ask whether such prayer changes the situation for which I am praying, I am really asking whether such prayer modifies the way in which God’s action meets and changes that situation. I am asking whether God’s action can be thought to <span class="italic">respond</span> to the prayer in some way, such that the prayer becomes the <span class="italic">occasion </span>for a change in the world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">All my earlier discussion about God’s agency in the world comes into play here: whether I am to think of God ‘breaking’ the normal laws of nature, or of God exploiting the give in those laws, or of God using the freedom that God has in creating the world to bring about a world in which God’s purposes are fulfilled. But there is now an added kick to the question: even if I grant that in some such way God does steer the world towards an end, am I to think that God does so <span class="italic">in response</span> to the prayers of God’s creatures?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In all of the models that I outlined, it is possible to think that God has so arranged matters that God’s activity becomes more directly evident at some times and places in the world – producing hints and signs of the flourishing that God has for the world. And it is possible to think that, by God’s grace, where and when this happens depends in part upon the prayers of God’s creatures. I heard once of an office building in which, if the right combination of windows happened to be open, a strong breeze would blow through the building and slam the doors, even on an apparently windless day. A secretary on the fourth floor, say, unaware that the relevant pattern of windows open around the building was nearly complete, might open his own window only to hear doors slamming immediately all over the building. So it might be with prayer: prayer opens a window, and it might be that the opening of that window somehow completes a set of circumstances that lets the wind of God’s action blow through the world in a particular way, shaping events half a world away. It may be that the world that God has made, as well as having all the visible interdependences and links of cause and effect that science rightly investigates, is by God’s grace webbed together in this other way as well, such that my prayer can be the occasion for changes that have little or nothing to do with the influence or agency I normally think of myself as having.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As with the more general topic of the previous section, I find myself an agnostic here too. It may be that something like this does indeed hold. It may be, on the other hand, that prayer has more to do with the person praying becoming aligned to the love of God as it pours upon the world, and trusting that this unfailing love is present and active, however hidden it might be, in the situation about which he is praying. I do not know which of these is true, but neither do I think that I need to know. As a Christian, I believe myself called to pray in all things and to trust in all things – and that ought to be enough for me. The doctrine of providence has little to do with explanation, and much to do with trust.</p>

				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Going further</span></p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Traditionally, the doctrine of providence has been closely related to the practice of ‘figural reading’ of the Bible – the kind of reading that claims that characters or incidents from the Old Testament, for instance, are ‘fulfilled’ in Christ – are ‘types’ or ‘figures’ of Christ. This connection is worth exploring further for the illumination it casts on what providence means. I have written about this in chapters 6 and 7 of <span class="italic">Christ, Providence and History: Hans W. Frei’s Public Theology</span> (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2004).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The nature of human freedom is, of course, a perplexing and bewildering one, and the line I have taken in this one skirts some deep quagmires.

But against the supreme law of nature, which is beyond the knowledge both of the ungodly and of weak believers, God never acts, any more than He acts against himself.’ Augustine of Hippo, <span class="italic">Reply to Faustus the Manichaean</span>, 26.3, in Philip Schaff (ed.), <span class="italic">Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</span>, First Series, vol. 4 (New York: Christian Literature Company, 1887), pp. 321–2; available online at the Christian Classics Ethereal Library, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf104.iv.ix.xxviii.html.
