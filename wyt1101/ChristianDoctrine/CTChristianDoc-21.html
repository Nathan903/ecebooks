				<p class="text">This is the last chapter of the book – and the one in which I finally explain what I have been up to. That is, this chapter is the closest I get to explaining my theological method. In Chapter 15, I introduced the idea of ‘biblical settlements’, and began to talk about a ‘Trinitarian settlement’. The focal meaning or core narrative of that settlement has been the subject matter of this whole book: the story that the world is being drawn by the Spirit into conformity to Christ on the way to the Father. In this chapter, I will suggest how the role and authority of the Bible can be understood in this settlement, and how it relates to tradition, to experience, and to reason as the source and foundation of theology.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">I am going to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that the Bible should be read ‘around Jesus’, with its primary purpose being to enable the formation of Christlike life in the world;</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that the Bible should be read ‘in the Spirit’, with its interpretation being the task of the whole body of Christ held together by the Spirit; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">suggest that the Bible should be read ‘on the way to the Father’, with its interpretation being a driver of the journey into ever deeper participation in the Father’s kingdom of love and justice.</li>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">What role do you think the Bible can and should play in enabling the following of Jesus of Nazareth? And what role do you think the Spirit plays – both in the original production of the Bible, and in its interpretation now? And what role should the Christian tradition play, either in guiding one’s reading of Scripture, or in providing a source of insights or information alongside it? Take some time now to jot down your initial answers to these questions.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">If you type ‘inspiration of scripture’ into an internet search engine like Google, you will find a large number of sites that discuss the involvement of the Spirit in the production of the Bible (and sometimes discuss the involvement of the Spirit in its interpretation and use as well). Most of these sites seem to come from a conservative theological stable. It is worth glancing through a few of these now, and then comparing them with what I have to say about the Spirit later in the chapter.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-B" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold-italic">Additional reading</span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-1"><span class="bold">Reading around Jesus: Witness</span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus of Nazareth is, according to the doctrine of the incarnation, a word spoken by God to the world, calling the world into communion with God. And the same doctrine claims that the Jesus who is God’s word is a fully human being, who lived his life in a particular time and place in history. How is that address, made at one time and place, to be an address to the whole world, unless there is some means by which it can be spread or passed on? The argument of Chapter 6 could be summarized in the claim that it is the Spirit who is the one who is responsible for the spreading or passing on of the divine address to the world in Jesus. It is the Spirit who allows others to hear God’s address in Jesus Christ; it is the Spirit who impels response to this address. The Spirit is the one who witnesses to Christ, and the Spirit does so by forming lives that witness to Christ – whether we think of that as the Spirit splitting the white light of Christ into the rainbow of diverse faces in which that light is refracted, or as the Spirit forming a community of givers and receivers whose currency is Christ. The Spirit forms a Church that, as I argued in Chapter 14, is called into being <span class="italic">by </span>witness, called into being <span class="italic">to</span> witness, and lives by <span class="italic">being</span> witness.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In this chapter, I am going to ask what role the Bible, the Christian tradition and experience play in this work of the Spirit. And I will ask how <span class="italic">theology </span>is formed by engagement with the Bible, with the Christian tradition and with experience. Reflection on the Bible will be the central thread running through the chapter, but I will argue that attention to tradition and to experience, far from being competing sources that need to be balanced with this biblical focus, are essential to making that biblical focus possible.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The simplest way of understanding why the Bible is important in the picture I have just sketched is to focus on one element of that picture. I said that, according to the doctrine of the incarnation, the divine address to the world that is Jesus of Nazareth is an address spoken in a specific time and place in history. If Christians were primarily followers of a philosophy, it would not particularly matter <span class="italic">when</span> the message that they followed was first spoken. Later restatements of that message might well be clearer, better argued and more accurate. In Christianity, however, the message that constitutes the religion is not a free-floating philosophy but a life lived in history, and so Christians are bound to have a stake in <span class="italic">historical</span> witness to that life: testimony to the events of Christ’s life and to the impact that they had upon those around him. Christianity lives by constant return to this historical witness, because it lives by constant return to the history of Jesus.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-364" id="footnote-169-364-backlink">364</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">As this chapter goes on, it will become apparent that there are several factors that complicate this picture. Where does the Old Testament fit in, for instance? What difference does it make when Christians claim that Jesus is alive, and so not straightforwardly confined to one time and place? Does appeal to the Spirit’s role as witness mean that Christians need not rely on the ordinary processes of historical witness in order to know Jesus?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Nevertheless, the central theological claim about the Bible is that it can (in some way, and in the right circumstances) convey the divine address originally spoken in and as Jesus’ life to readers who live in times and places far removed from the original utterance; it can (in some way, and in the right circumstances) call believers to, and guide them into, ever fuller participation in the Christlike love and justice that are the life of God. I will be suggesting that the Bible can best be seen as a constant companion and guide for those who are on a journey into knowledge of God.</p>

							</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p class="text-line-above">There are two sides of my claim about the Bible that need to be held together, and this passage can be read as touching on both of them. In the first place, in 2 Timothy 3, ‘scripture’ is described as useful for ‘training in righteousness’. The Bible has been seen in Christian theology as a school for godly life, helping direct the feet of any who desire to walk in the way of love and justice, and indeed awakening and strengthening that desire in the first place. The claim that these ‘sacred writings’ are ‘inspired by God’ in 2 Timothy 3 seems to mean no more and no less than this: that these writings are, by the grace of God, in the fullest sense <span class="italic">edifying</span> for godly life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the Trinitarian settlement, however, it would be a serious theological distortion to take the Bible as some kind of moral handbook, or guide to holy living, in a way that is detached from its role as witness to Jesus of Nazareth. As we have seen, Christian theology declares that the Word spoken by God in Jesus Christ is not a message that can be understood without reference to the messenger; he, the human being from Nazareth, <span class="italic">is</span> the message, and so 2 Timothy speaks not just of training in righteousness, but of ‘salvation <span class="italic">through faith in Christ Jesus</span>’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the second place, therefore, the Bible is a witness to Jesus of Nazareth. If the Bible is to convey adequately to its readers the divine address, it can only do so if it is an adequate witness to this particular man. And ‘adequate’ in this case will mean ‘able to convey the way in which this particular man was a word from God’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-365" id="footnote-169-365-backlink">365</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the Trinitarian settlement, however, it would be another serious theological distortion to take the Bible to be an adequate witness to Jesus Christ in a way that is detached from its role as inspired training in godly life. So, although Christian theology also has a considerable stake in the ability of the Bible to teach us about the particular historical individual Jesus of Nazareth, it should be no surprise that we run into problems if we try to think of it simply as a means to an exact and comprehensive factual reconstruction of what Jesus did and said. Its purpose, according to the Trinitarian settlement, is neither to satisfy curiosity, nor to provide accurate reportage of the life of Christ – it is to witness to the way in which Jesus is God’s compelling, captivating, life-transforming address. Its purpose, according to this settlement, is to enable the believer to be caught up in the movement of God’s life that took place in history in Jesus of Nazareth, and which began catching up those around him who became his witnesses.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-366" id="footnote-169-366-backlink">366</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Probably the most controversial aspect of what I have just said is that line about ‘an exact and comprehensive factual reconstruction of what Jesus did and said’. Some readers will probably be thinking that I have just opened a doorway to the downplaying or dismissing of the Bible’s historical accuracy. These are very controversial waters, as this is a topic that has been, and will no doubt continue to be, very hotly debated. My point is, however, that Christian theology does not need to have much of a stake one way or the other in claiming that the Bible provides ‘an exact and comprehensive factual reconstruction of what Jesus did and said’. Its claim, after all, is somewhat different: it claims that these writings are, by the grace of God, edifying for Christian life, and that they are so by being adequate witnesses to the man Jesus of Nazareth, able to convey the way in which this man was a word from God. The New Testament authors were not reporters or historians, trying to set down a neutrally accurate account of Jesus’ doings; they were those who believed they had been addressed by God in and through Jesus’ life, death and resurrection, and they were witnessing to that address so that others could also hear it and be bowled over by it.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Witness not replacement</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">My words could also be taken in a milder sense, simply as claiming that the biblical text is not and cannot be <span class="italic">identical </span>to the human being Jesus of Nazareth, whatever one might think of its historical accuracy. The Bible is, after all, a text, and so cannot provide more than a pen-portrait of a human being. John 21.24–25 acknowledges this:</p>
				<p class="quotes">This [i.e. the disciple who reclined next to Jesus at the supper] is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if every one of them were written down, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">A book, even one with such a multifaceted, diverse and complex portrait of Jesus as the Bible, is not and cannot be a substitute for the person himself. It is a witness to Jesus, not a replacement for him.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Of course that witness crucially involves narratives and anecdotes about Jesus, and theology will clearly have some kind of stake in the broad accuracy of those stories; but the witness that the Bible offers is far more than a set of accurate narratives: all sorts of other forms of writing are used to convey the impact that Jesus had upon his followers, and to help catch them up into the movement into new life that he initiated among those followers. The New Testament records, as it were, the captivating music that is made when human lives are taken hold of by God’s hand in Jesus Christ, and lifted up to new life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">We should also note that the New Testament authors wrote under the conviction that Jesus was still alive and, by the Spirit, still present and active in their midst. They were not writing memorials to one long gone, they were engaged in an ongoing relationship with one still living, and their witness was therefore intended to introduce people into that living relationship, rather than simply to provide information about past events. The Bible is written from within that ongoing relationship, as an invitation or guide to it.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">A secondary matter</span></p>
				<p class="text">All this, of course, leaves plenty of room to debate exactly what level of factual accuracy can be attributed to the Gospel accounts. What I have just been saying does not force the issue one way or the other – it would be compatible with a maximalist account that claimed a very high level of historical accuracy, and it would be compatible with a more minimalist account that claimed that the bones of a ‘historical’ account had been fleshed out with all sorts of other materials that a modern mind would not think of as straightforwardly historical. The debate between those positions, and all shades of opinion in between, is one that will run and run. The only point I wish to insist upon is that this debate is, theologically speaking, a secondary matter. That is, it is an argument about the precise nature of the underpinnings of what is theologically primary, rather than itself being a debate about what is primary. The primary thing, from a Christian theological perspective, is the ability of the New Testament writings to convey to people the address of God in Jesus of Nazareth, who is not dead but alive.</p>
				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">Whether or not you agree with me, spend some time thinking about how you would construct an argument against my position. First, spend some time thinking about how you could argue for a maximalist account, arguing for a very high level of factual accuracy in the New Testament accounts, on grounds that you think ought to convince me. How, on the basis of what I have written, do you think I might respond? Second, spend some time thinking about how you could argue for an even more minimalist account, one that did not require that the New Testament texts be taken as referring to real events at all. Once again, try to argue on grounds that mesh with the theology I have been expounding, and try to work out how I might respond.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-5"><span class="bold">Jesus in the Hebrew Scriptures?</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">I have been talking primarily about the New Testament so far, but the New Testament writings are relative latecomers on the scene. For the vast majority of the time in which the New Testament writings were being produced, the only Scriptures that Christians had were those Hebrew Scriptures that we now call the Old Testament. It is, for instance, primarily Hebrew Scriptures that are being discussed in 2 Timothy 3.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-367" id="footnote-169-367-backlink">367</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Marcion</span></p>
				<p class="text">The acknowledgement of the importance of the Hebrew Scriptures has not always been made in Christian theology. Most famously, it was denied by a second-century theologian who established a popular and resilient Christian network as an alternative to the more established networks with which he had come into conflict: Marcion. He seems to have regarded the God of the Hebrew Bible as a malevolent and arbitrary tyrant, and contrasted him with the God revealed as the Father of Jesus Christ, who he regarded as entirely unknown before Christ’s coming. This Marcionite rejection of the Hebrew Scriptures was itself rejected by more mainstream Christians, and mainstream Christianity eventually ended up with Hebrew Scriptures firmly part of its canon. Nevertheless, ‘Marcionite’ rejections of the Hebrew Bible have cropped up again and again in Christian history.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-368" id="footnote-169-368-backlink">368</a></span></p>
				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">It is sometimes claimed that most modern churches are functionally Marcionite – in other words, that the Old Testament barely features in their lives. Is this true in blatant or subtle ways in churches that you know of?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Most importantly for theological purposes, the Hebrew Scriptures were <span class="italic">Jesus’</span> Scriptures. I have already said, in Chapter 5, that Jesus’ identity was</p>
				<p class="quotes">a thoroughly and ineradicably Jewish identity, formed by Jewish practices, Jewish Scriptures, Jewish ideas, Jewish people. … [T]o deny that it is constitutive of his identity is to deny his full humanity: Judaism provided the womb from which the baby Jesus emerged, the swaddling bands that surrounded him from the moment that he appeared, and the nurture that allowed him to grow towards maturity.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">The Hebrew Scriptures were central to that Jewish context. Jesus drew upon those Scriptures in order to make sense of himself and his ministry, and they provide the essential backdrop against which his life, death and resurrection make sense. In fact, one can properly think of Jesus Christ as himself a living commentary upon the Hebrew Bible: he lives in response to it, and his life gives Christians new ways of reading it.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In fact, the New Testament as a whole, precisely because it can and should be read by Christians as witness to this Jesus, can and should be read by them as a commentary upon the Hebrew Scriptures. It is a commentary written with a conviction that the story told in the Hebrew Bible continued in a startlingly unexpected way – but it is told with the conviction that this startling continuation enables a new kind of sense to be made of the story so far. It is a commentary that has led to the ‘Hebrew Scriptures’ being renamed ‘Old Testament’, indicative of the fact that these are now seen as the early episodes of a story that has continued in this new way. But ‘Old’ does not mean ‘dispensable’, nor does it mean ‘secondary’: Christian theology cannot survive without the Hebrew Scriptures that are its bedrock, even if it is committed to reading them only in the light of the divine commentary that it believes has been spoken in Christ.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Paul’s reading</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In a recent book, Francis Watson has made this argument very strongly about the writings of Paul. He argues <span class="italic">against</span> those who think that</p>
				<p class="quotes">Paul’s disagreement with Judaism derives from a christological conviction that is self-grounded and self-sufficient, and that the pervasive appeal to scripture is merely a secondary consequence of that primary conviction. In this account, the relationship between christology and scripture is a unilateral one: christology determines how scripture is read, but christology itself is not itself determined by the reading of scripture. In the last resort, that would mean that scripture is dispensable to Paul.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Instead, he argues</p>
				<p class="quotes">Scripture is not a secondary confirmation of a Christ-event entire and complete in itself; for scripture is not external to the Christ-event but is constitutive of it, the matrix within which it takes shape and comes to be what it is. Paul proclaims not a pure, unmediated experience of Christ, but rather a Christ whose death and resurrection occur ‘according to the scriptures’ (1 Corinthians 15.3–4). Without scripture, there is no gospel; apart from the scriptural matrix, there is no Christ. The Christ who sheds light on scripture is also and above all the Christ on whom scripture simultaneously sheds its own light. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">[S]cripture is not overwhelmed by the light of an autonomous Christ-event needing no scriptural mediation. It is scripture that shapes the contours of the Christ-event, and to discern how it does so is to uncover the true meaning of scripture itself.</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">The Hebrew Scriptures are, however, texts that have another major body of religious readers, who do not read with the same New Testament commentary that Christians use. If they have any commitment to taking these texts of the Hebrew Bible seriously, and any commitment to being challenged by them, Christian readers can and should be challenged by reading in dialogue with Jews who, simply because they read the same texts differently, can help Christians see where they have relied more upon their assumptions about what the texts <span class="italic">should </span>say than on what they do <span class="italic">in fact </span>say. Reading alongside Jewish readers can help Christian readers become more attentive to the difficulty and strangeness of the texts, and to see ways in which they have misread them or read them inadequately – just as there may be ways in which the dialogue with Christians can recall Jewish readers to see their Scriptures differently, and notice things about them that they have underplayed. Of course, there is not likely to be any easy resolution to such a debate – Jews and Christians do read these texts differently, and the differences are far from trivial – but that does not mean that commitment to such dialogue, even if it simply means getting hold of some Jewish commentaries, cannot become a challenging and enlivening part of Christian practice.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-7"><span class="bold">Reading around Jesus: Unity and diversity</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">What I have said so far points us toward a way of thinking about the diversity of the biblical text. Think, for instance, of the strange fact that the New Testament preserves four Gospels. The reader concerned to rush to a harmonious or unified reading will need to explain away the differences, the particularities, of each Gospel – or at least reduce them to minor and clearly harmonious variations. The reader who resists too-easy harmony, on the other hand, will spend time with each Gospel, registering the differences between the portraits that each paints: the differences of style, of emphasis, of purpose, of interpretation. Rather than producing a harmony in which all differences are quickly resolved, the reader will know that these differing texts need to be read in constant counterpoint with one another, and that rather than finding <span class="italic">the </span>answer to the riddle posed by these differences, the reader is called to live a life in which these distinct voices become constant companions. The unity does not need to be provided by reconstruction of the one factual story to which the differing Gospels are witnesses: it is provided by the unity of a life that is being moulded into conformity to Christ by the buffeting of these differing texts.</p>

That is, as I write I have found myself asking, ‘What would <span class="italic">x</span> have thought of this bit?’ – and thinking I could guess what they would say. It is almost as if I hear their different voices, making their very different criticisms, and redirect my writing so as to head these criticisms off at the pass. Those very disparate voices are not in harmony with one another, but they have become constant companions to my writing. What I am suggesting about the role of the Bible’s multiple voices is not entirely dissimilar.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Christians do not need to be embarrassed, therefore, that the Bible was not produced by a single author setting down in one go a coherent vision, but by individuals and communities stretched over time, struggling to come to terms with the reality that they had encountered – and struggling to come to terms with one another. The Bible was not, after all, dropped fully formed from heaven. It was written by human beings – precarious, finite, weak and mortal people – who witness to God’s address precisely as they are caught up and shaped by it, and drawn by it into the life of God. To believe in the inspiration of the Bible is not, in this settlement, to believe that the humanity of the Bible’s authors (or of the communities that collected, reworked and preserved these texts) was somehow overcome or rendered irrelevant. It is, rather, to believe that these human beings, as human beings, were truly being caught by the one Spirit into conformity to the one Christ, on the way to the one Father, and that the Bible was written from within the journey to that one goal that the various authors took in their very different contexts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">How far can this diversity stretch? If Christians believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the one wholly given over to the life of God, then he can and should be the criterion for Christians’ judgements concerning all other claims about where godly life is to be found – and that includes being the criterion for claims about the godliness of the life portrayed and expressed in the Bible. Jesus is the touchstone for the movement in which biblical readers <span class="italic">and </span>biblical authors are caught up. A Christian reading of Scripture – a reading that looks to the Bible as revelation inspired by the Spirit of Christ – will therefore be a reading in which Christian readers bring all the meaning that they think they are finding to Jesus, to be judged and sifted by him. After all, it is Jesus who is God’s Word; it is Jesus who is God’s life lived fully in the world. All other voices – including the voices of his followers and witnesses – lisp and stutter as they try to repeat that Word.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And that means that the Trinitarian settlement can cope with (though it need not insist upon) the claim that there might be portions of Scripture in which the witness given to this movement towards God is, shall we say, oblique. Take Psalm 137, for instance, in which one of the exiles in Babylon calls down curses upon his captors: ‘Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock.’ Christian readers cannot simply cut this verse out of the Bible, but that does not necessarily mean that they have to find some sense in which this sentiment is <span class="italic">acceptable</span>. If Christians allow their reading of this verse to be questioned and judged at the foot of the cross, they will have to refuse the violent fantasy that it offers to them. They still need to take this verse seriously, however, and that might mean taking seriously what it reveals about the cycle of violence and counter-violence in which those being drawn by the Spirit deeper into God are nevertheless still caught, and about the dangerous liaisons into which faith can enter with that violence. In other words, Christian readers may find that, read in the stark light of Christ, this text offers an uncomfortable insight into their own violence, and that it too can become a part of God’s address to them, even while they deny that it is a direct description of God’s will. We might say that such a text becomes Scripture precisely as it is allowed to give this witness in Jesus’ light.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-370" id="footnote-169-370-backlink">370</a></span></p>

				<p class="text-line-above">Working within this Trinitarian biblical settlement, a Christian reader is bound to ask how Psalm 1 relates to Jesus. In what way might Jesus of Nazareth be seen as a commentary upon this Jewish expression of delight in God’s life-giving law?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Psalm sets out a contrast between the ungodly and the godly. The ungodly are those who, superficially, seem to have a stable and attractive life: a person might be tempted to walk with them, stand with them, sit with them; they have a way of thinking (the counsel of the ungodly) and of acting (the way of sinners), and a position from which to inspect the rest of the world (the seat of the scornful). Despite this apparent stability, however, they are ultimately insubstantial: they blow away like chaff, their path leads nowhere, and they have nowhere to stand when faced with God’s judgement. Their lives are founded on nothing and lead to nothing.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The righteous, on the other hand, may at first sight seem insecure: they are defined negatively as those who do not take part in the stability of the wicked. Yet they know where true stability lies: they hold fast to God’s word, the law, and meditate upon it, allowing themselves to be shaped by it. They have <span class="italic">true </span>stability, like well-rooted trees; their way does not lead to nothing, but to prosperity. God cares for their way, and they will stand firm in the face of his judgement.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">When placed in the wider canon of the Hebrew Bible, the Psalm could itself be seen as a commentary upon the kind of theology expressed in Deuteronomy 11.26–28:</p>
				<p class="quotes">See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I am commanding you today; and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn from the way that I am commanding you today, to follow other gods that you have not known.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Like Deuteronomy, the Psalm sets out two ways to live, the way of blessing and the way of the curse, and as in Deuteronomy it is the delectable law of God that marks the boundary between them.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The wider canon of the Hebrew Bible raises an important question about this Psalm, however. The equation between obedience and prosperity promised in verse 3 is called into question in the book of Job, which makes it clear that obedience can – indeed, that obedience <span class="italic">must</span> – be capable of surviving the end of prosperity, and that obedience that is tied too closely to the promise of prosperity might be no obedience at all. The queasiness we might feel over the Psalm’s promise that the righteous will prosper in all that they do is therefore itself biblically warranted. (Note that it is <span class="italic">not</span>, therefore, a Christian queasiness with a Jewish doctrine, but a queasiness internal to the Hebrew canon.)<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-372" id="footnote-169-372-backlink">372</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">What happens, then, when this Psalm is read by Christians? Older Christian interpretations would have said pretty straightforwardly that the Psalm was <span class="italic">about </span>Jesus, with Jesus being ‘the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-373" id="footnote-169-373-backlink">373</a></span> Either the authors knew that they were being inspired by God to speak of the coming messiah, or God in some sense caused these words to be written as a messianic prophecy without the apparent authors’ knowledge.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Many Christian readers now would probably reject the idea that this Psalm should in any sense be seen as a direct prophecy of Christ, or that it could in any straightforward sense be seen as being ‘about’ Christ. They are more likely to begin with a reading of the Psalm in its own terms, as a Jewish depiction of righteousness. Yet readers who follow the Trinitarian approach to Scripture that I am outlining might well ask what happens when, with playful seriousness, they ask what it would mean to take this description of godliness and apply it to Jesus. Jesus is, I have repeatedly said, the one who shows what godly life looks like for Christian theology, and it would be thoroughly Marcionite to think that the righteousness he displays could be anything other than a commentary upon the righteousness of the Hebrew Bible. To take this Psalm to be about Jesus is playful, because it does not involve one in the claim that the Psalm was somehow written <span class="italic">so as </span>to be about him; but it is serious because it is a playfulness that is unavoidable once one has recognized the nature of the Psalm and of Christian claims about Jesus.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the first place, one might find the rejection of the attractive stability of the ungodly sharpened. To the progression of metaphors from walking to standing to sitting we could add lying down, and note that Jesus was said to be one who had no place to lay his head. In Jesus’ case, the way of righteousness leads to the cross – a leafless, unwatered tree. His way looks like the way that leads to destruction, to the curse, to the end of prosperity. And yet Christians claim that this way of the cross is the way of life, that it is watched over by God, and is the only way that stands on the day of judgement.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Once one has got that far, however, the Psalm asks us whether Jesus’ righteousness, the way of the cross, can be understood as ‘delight … in the law of the Lord’. We might find ourselves led to think of Jesus’ claim that not one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until it is all accomplished, and that no one whose righteousness does not exceed that of the scribes and the Pharisees can enter the kingdom of heaven; we might also think of Jesus’ claim that the whole of the law and the prophets hangs on the command to love God and to love neighbour. The commentary upon this Psalm that Jesus’ life offers is not a commentary that rejects its focus on the law (it does not see delight in the law as a Jewish doctrine that needs to be rejected or overcome); it accepts it and provides a particular interpretation of what delight in the law means. The way of righteousness is the way of the cross; the way of the cross is the way of love and justice; the way of love and justice is the way of obedience to and delight in the law.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">A Christian meditation on the Psalm, therefore, might take the already-existing question mark about the link between prosperity and obedience, connect it to the Psalm’s own rejection of the attractive stability of the ungodly, and be led into serious questions about what, in the light of Christ, true stability and true prosperity look like – and one’s understanding of the Psalm’s subject-matter, true righteousness, might begin to develop. And a Christian meditation might take the Psalm’s focus on the law, connect it to New Testament materials about Jesus and the law, and be led into serious questions about what, in the light of the Psalm, Christ’s righteousness looks like – and one’s understanding of the Gospels’ subject matter, Jesus of Nazareth, might similarly begin to develop.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Psalm can send one deeper into the gospel; the gospel can send one deeper into the Psalm. It is not, though, that there is a straightforward sense in which these meditations are <span class="italic">the</span> meaning of the Psalm, if by that we are claiming that they were intended by the original author or understood by the original audience. They are, nevertheless, meditations that are made possible by, prompted by, even made unavoidable by this Psalm when read in the context of the wider Hebrew canon and the Christian canon that holds together both Old and New Testaments. This kind of reading is not an attempt to discover the one, plain meaning of the Psalm, but to be led by the Psalm into deeper thinking.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This process of being led into deeper thinking does not end there, however. Were a Christian to read this Psalm alongside a Jewish reader, the Christian might have her attention drawn to one of the elements that my exposition so far has ignored: the reference to the ‘congregation of the righteous’. What this Psalm opposes to the way of the ungodly, the Jewish reader might say, is obedience to God’s law in the context of the people of Israel. It is a different kind of continuity and stability: the continuity and stability of people and observance. Holiness and blessing, in the Psalm’s terms, can’t be detached from these things. And yes, these contrast with the stability of the ungodly (the history of the Jewish people over the last 2,500 years is enough to show us that), but one should not overdraw that contrast until it becomes a contrast between the purely material stability and prosperity of the ungodly and the purely spiritual stability and prosperity of the godly. In a Jewish reader’s hands, therefore, the Psalm might become a challenge to think about the material conditions of holiness in the Hebrew Bible: law, people, land. Isn’t that what it really means, the Jewish reader might say, to be in the congregation of the faithful, planted, watered and in the deepest sense prosperous? To put it another way, hasn’t the Christian reading too easily airbrushed out the full meaning of ‘law’?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, when this text from the Hebrew Bible is read in discussion with a Jewish reader, a Christian’s reflections might be pushed still deeper, and he might have some aspects of his Christian reading challenged.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I don’t mean to bring this discussion to any kind of closure. Attention to the text in this light both of the Christian canon and of Jewish respondents does not lead to a decision about the one thing that this text really says: it does not close down one’s options in that way. Rather, it opens up a field for discussion and enquiry, for argument and exploration. This is not the Bible providing the answers with which thought can stop; this is the Bible as constant companion on a journey that never ends.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-10"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">This text from the Hebrew Bible makes sense in its original historical and canonical context.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Christian readers will ask what sense Jesus makes of it, and what sense it helps them make of him.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The attempt to answer those questions will not necessarily lead to any easy answers.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The attempt to answer those questions may bring Christian readers into dialogue with those who read differently.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-11"><span class="bold">Reading in the Spirit</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">I said in Chapter 6 that</p>
				<p class="quotes">The Spirit is, for Christian theology, that power of God that lures and woos and impels and drives and enables and drags and excites people on journeys deeper into the God of Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">If the Bible is a constant companion on those journeys deeper into the God of Jesus Christ, then it is embroiled somehow in the agency of the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That does not necessarily mean that the Spirit acts as the guarantor of any supernatural accuracy in the Bible’s texts. Nor does it necessarily mean that the Spirit gives readers of the Bible any supernatural ability to arrive at the right interpretation of Biblical passages. Some will want to make those claims, of course, but I am not sure that they follow all that neatly from what I have been saying. I think there are more important ways in which the Spirit and the Bible relate.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the first place, the kind of use of the Bible that I have been discussing involves trust that the Spirit was at work conforming the biblical authors to the God of Jesus Christ. That is, it involves the trust that these texts really are words spoken from within the movement of their authors into the life of God. And that movement is one that is drawing them into conformity to Christ. That is, I think, an assumption that lies behind the willingness to trust the witness of these texts, whether it is a positive or negative one, to the nature of that journey – and so lies behind much that I have said already.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the second place, the kind of use of the Bible that I have been discussing suggests that it is most appropriately read by people who are themselves being led by the Spirit into conformity with Christ on the way to the Father. That is, the vantage point from which the Bible can be seen properly as Holy Scripture is the vantage point of those who are being drawn into Christlike love and justice, and so into knowledge of God. This will lie behind much of what I will say in the final two sections of this chapter.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Lastly, the kind of use of the Bible that I have been discussing is part of the process by which not just individuals but the whole body of Christ is drawn into closer conformity with Christ on the way to the Father. And that means that one reads in ways that are open to the Spirit when we read in ways that are open to the whole body of Christ. I said in Chapter 6 that ‘The Spirit’s work is to allow each person to give such a gift – a gift that contributes some aspect, some part of Christ to the whole body of Christ.’ Reading ‘in the Spirit’ is reading that can receive as a gift the reading of the Bible by other members of the Body. That is the main point that I want to examine in this section, and as we will see, I take it to mean that reading the Bible in the Spirit will involve reading that is ecumenical, traditional, inclusive and eschatological.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">First, reading in the Spirit is ecumenical reading. Different Christians read differently, and the ways in which they read differently are closely bound up with the ways in which they live the Christian life differently. That was one of the main claims of Chapter 15 – and, given all that we said about the Spirit and the body of Christ in Chapter 6 and about the unity and catholicity of the Church in Chapter 13, its implication is obvious. Christians should be open to the possibility that the reading of those Christians who read differently can be a gift to them, calling them back to the biblical text, teaching them to see more there, or to see what is there differently. Of course one does not want to be uncritical; of course one does not simply want to say that anything goes. Nevertheless, to read in the Spirit of the body of Christ is to approach the reading of Christians from different communities, different settlements, with humility, openness and charity. It is also to trust that one’s own reading can be a gift to others. To read in the Spirit is to read ecumenically – that is, it is to read in pursuit of fuller communion with those Christians with whom one differs.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Second, reading in the Spirit is traditional reading. The Christian tradition is nothing other than the communion of Christians extended through time as well as space. That earlier generations are now dead does not mean that their ways of being Christian, of knowing Christ, of reading the Bible, cannot be gifts to present-day Christians just as surely as current generations of Christians can be gifts to one another. Attending to the Christian tradition is, one might say, a form of ecumenism in time. The Christian tradition is not a deposit of correct readings that today’s Christians must adopt at all costs, but an unruly and argumentative community of those who see the same things differently. To read in the Spirit is to read in the company of those who read long before, seeking and expecting a gift in what they said and did.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Living tradition</span></p>
				<p class="text">‘[T]he theology of past periods, classical and less classical, also plays a part and demands a hearing. It demands a hearing as surely as it occupies a place with us in the context of the Church. … We have to remember the communion of saints, bearing and being borne by each other, asking and being asked, having to take mutual responsibility for and among the sinners gathered together in Christ. As regards theology also, we cannot be in the Church without taking as much responsibility for the theology of the past, as for the theology of our present. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Schleiermacher, and all the rest are not dead but living. They still speak and demand a hearing as living voices, as surely as we know that they and we belong together in the Church. They made in their time the same contribution to the task of the Church that is required of us today. As we make our contribution, they join in with theirs, and we cannot play our part today without allowing them to play theirs. Our responsibility is not only to God, to ourselves, to the men of today, to other living theologians, but to them. There is no past in the Church, so there is no past in theology.’</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Third, reading in the Spirit is inclusive reading. The Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and like Christ is to be found where respectable people don’t go, among the marginalized, the dispossessed, and the weak. To read in the Spirit will be to listen particularly for the gift that one might receive from those readers whose voices have been marginalized or hidden in the tradition of the Church: the voices of women, of the laity, of the poor, of non-whites, of non-Westerners, of gays, of the disabled. Precisely because they have not been prominent voices in Christianity’s ongoing conversations, these marginalized Christians may have the most exciting gifts to give: ways of recalling one to the Bible to see differently what one thought one knew. To read in the Spirit is to seek to widen the interpretive conversation until it becomes more fully inclusive.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Fourth, reading in the Spirit is eschatological reading. In all the ways I have just described – ecumenical, traditional and inclusive – all Christians’ present readings are incomplete. Christians do not yet read in a fully united body of Christ; they do not yet read in a body of Christ that remembers and holds fast to its earlier generations, and they do not yet read in a body of Christ that has overcome the exclusions that keep some categories of members marginalized. Reading in the Spirit can only be reading in hope and anticipation; reading in hope of a perfected body of Christ that will have been lifted by God’s redemptive action beyond all these forms of disunity, and shaping one’s readings now as much as possible in the light of that vision.</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The vantage point from which the Bible can be seen properly as Holy Scripture is the vantage point of those who are being drawn into Christlike love and justice, and so into knowledge of God.</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-13"><span class="bold">What is tradition?</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">The Christian tradition is, I have just said, the extension of the Church in time – and attention to the tradition is simply the temporal form of ecumenism: holding on to other, differing Christian communities and individuals in the trust that one will receive a blessing from their difference. There are other ways of thinking about the theological necessity of attending to tradition, however.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Attention to the tradition – to the voices of the Christian past – can also be a matter of understanding more clearly the etymology or genealogy of one’s current beliefs and practices. Some configuration of ideas and practices may seem inviolable, an eternal and inherent part of Christianity – until a genealogical investigation shows the specific circumstances in which it arose, the specific purposes it fulfilled, and reveals its contingency and malleability. So, for instance, careful investigation of the history of the ‘personal saviour’ settlement is likely to suggest that it is just that: a particular, evolving settlement. Other ideas or practices may seem thoroughly dispensable, until a genealogical investigation shows the deep questions that were at issue when those ideas or practices were formed – and so make one realize more clearly what would be involved in abandoning or altering them. So, for instance, one could imagine investigating the history of the idea of creation <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span>, having started with the assumption that it is an irrelevant bit of speculative metaphyics that has little to do with biblical theology – only to discover (as I suggested in Chapter 7) the deeper theological and pastoral roots of the idea. Attending to the Christian tradition is an important part of making enough sense of current practice and belief to know how to go on.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Attention to tradition can also be a matter of <span class="italic">apprenticeship</span>. After all, listening at the feet of old hands is one of the ways of learning the Christian language well. If one learns only from those who speak the language in one’s own present context, however, one’s ability to speak that language in new contexts may be limited. To learn that language at the feet of those who spoke it in contexts far removed from one’s own may give one’s own speech the resilience and flexibility to survive.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Attention to tradition can also be a matter of looking at a vast collection of experiments in Christian life and thought. There is nothing new under the sun, and what seem to people now to be bold new moves in Christian life and thought have probably been tried before. On the other hand, one can never step into the same river twice,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-375" id="footnote-169-375-backlink">375</a></span> so one cannot deduce that today’s development will simply follow the course of its well- or ill-fated precursors – but some of the possibilities and pitfalls inherent in the development might become clearer. Take, for instance, the emerging church movement’s experiments in the form of church life. There are, it turns out, all sorts of historical parallels and echoes to those experiments, and recognizing those parallels and echoes informs both support and criticism of the movement.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-376" id="footnote-169-376-backlink">376</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">One question remains, though. Is there any specific content that can be regarded as firmly established by the Christian tradition? Are the creeds, for instance, to be regarded as fixed points that it is now incumbent upon all future generations to accept? Christians differ on this point. Some will argue that the guidance of the Church by the Spirit is such that, from time to time, a hard-won consensus or near consensus emerges, which is then recognized by the Church at large as an authoritative clarification of the faith – and becomes a fixed point of dogma. For the Orthodox Church and some others, the Ecumenical Councils of the Church were (and, in principle, could be again) the bodies capable of recognizing and defining such moments of dogmatic consensus, and the key examples are the Nicene Creed and the Chalcedonian Definition.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-377" id="footnote-169-377-backlink">377</a></span> For the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope is regarded as having the authority to recognize and define such decisive points in the mind of the Church that lives in communion with him – and so (and only so) to define doctrine infallibly.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-378" id="footnote-169-378-backlink">378</a></span></p>

				<p class="text">‘That apostolic primacy which the Roman pontiff possesses as successor of Peter, the prince of the apostles, includes also the supreme power of teaching. … For the holy Spirit was promised to the successors of Peter not so that they might, by his revelation, make known some new doctrine, but that, by his assistance, they might religiously guard and faithfully expound the revelation or deposit of faith transmitted by the apostles. …</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Therefore, faithfully adhering to the tradition received from the beginning of the Christian faith, to the glory of God our saviour, for the exaltation of the catholic religion and for the salvation of the Christian people, with the approval of the sacred council, we teach and define as a divinely revealed dogma that when the Roman pontiff speaks <span class="italic">ex cathedra</span>, that is, when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole church, he possesses, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility which the divine Redeemer willed his church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals. Therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable.’</p>

				<p class="text">‘The greatest theological problem with infallibility is that it makes it very difficult for the church to admit it was wrong. I have considered making a T-shirt to wear to Catholic meetings with the slogan: “Infallibility means never having to say you’re sorry.” But being unable to say you’re sorry is to be unable to repent. Not to be able to repent means not being able to be open to divine grace. Thus infallibility is the sin of sins: a sin against the Holy Spirit. All areas where the church’s teachings are inadequate, distorted or erroneous are blocked from corrective development by the assumption of infallibility. One cannot change previous mistaken teachings, such as the ban on contraception – even if the worldwide church has come to a consensus that it needs to change – if you can’t admit that you have been wrong.’</p>

				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Others believe that while there might be some aspects of the Christian tradition that, because of the weight of deliberation that lies behind them, the breadth of the consensus they demanded, and the pervasiveness of their subsequent influence, have an especially strong authority for subsequent generations, they are not in themselves ‘irreformable’: it could in principle be shown that they distort or misdirect the apostolic witness to Christ, and need to be abandoned or reformed. For them, tradition cannot be seen as a deposit of authoritative dogmas, even if it is a deposit of much that the contemporary theologian cannot simply ignore, but must work through.</p>

As I said above, the vantage point from which the Bible can be seen properly as Holy Scripture is the vantage point of those who are being drawn into that Christlike love and justice on the way to the Father. To read on the way to the Father is to read in pursuit of the Father’s kingdom of love and justice.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This insight is one that has been renewed in recent decades by proponents of liberation theology. Liberation theology began when various Latin American theologians, driven by their understanding of the implications of the Gospel, committed themselves to working with the Latin American poor as they struggled for social and political liberation. They understood this as a way to pursue the love and justice of the Father’s kingdom. Once they were involved with the poor, however, they found that their understanding of theology and of the Bible in particular got shaken up. Things that had once seemed important receded into the background; things that had once seemed trivial assumed renewed urgency and importance. Interpretations of the Bible that had once seemed natural and helpful now began to seem stilted and irrelevant. Involvement in the practical struggle for liberation, alongside those whose struggle it was, led to new theological and biblical insights. But the process did not stop there. The liberation theologians had got involved in the struggle for liberation thanks to their existing theology and interpretation of the Bible, so it was inevitable that their new theological and biblical insights in turn changed the ways that they thought about and practised their participation in that struggle. In other words, a spiral of change emerged: participation led to new insights and changed theology, which in turn led to changed participation, which in turn led to new insights and changed theology, and so on. Throwing themselves into the pursuit of the Father’s kingdom of love and justice set these theologians on an ongoing journey of transformation that was a journey of ever-deeper participation in the struggle for love and justice in the world.</p>
				<p class="quotes">20Blessed are you who are poor,</p>
				<p class="quotes">For yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
				<p class="quotes">21Blessed are you who are hungry now,</p>
				<p class="quotes">for you will be filled.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Blessed are you who weep now,</p>
				<p class="quotes">for you will laugh. …</p>
				<p class="quotes">24But woe to you who are rich,</p>
				<p class="quotes">for you have received your consolation.</p>
				<p class="quotes">25Woe to you who are full now,</p>

				<p class="quotes">Woe to you who are laughing now,</p>
				<p class="quotes">for you will mourn and weep.</p>
				<p class="source">Luke 6.20–21, 24–25</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To see how this hermeneutical and participatory spiral might work, think of the beatitudes as they appear in Luke’s Gospel. Traditionally, Christian readers have tended to ‘spiritualize’ these blessings and woes – to assume that Jesus was talking about those who are <span class="italic">spiritually</span> rather than literally poor, hungry and tearful.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-381" id="footnote-169-381-backlink">381</a></span> Now imagine a Christian who had understood the blessing on those who are poor to be a blessing on those who were ‘poor in spirit’, and so a blessing on those who were humble, and who sought nothing for themselves. He might, on the basis of his existing understanding, think that it was a mark of being ‘poor in spirit’ not to seek prominent and powerful forms of Christian work, but to seek quiet service in little-regarded places – and so he might, say, get involved in running a shelter for the homeless.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As his involvement brought him into contact with the homeless people, hearing their stories, he might find that his compassion for them, and his desire to be with them and work for them, was awoken in new ways – ways that went beyond the desire for selfless service that had been his original motivation. With this new feeling in mind, he might find on returning to this passage that it made more sense to him now to read it as speaking primarily of literal, material poverty, hunger and mourning – of God’s real compassion for these people. His theology might begin to shift until he saw that God was not simply on the side of those who humbly and kindly give to the poor, but on the side of the poor themselves.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-382" id="footnote-169-382-backlink">382</a></span> He might begin to see from this passage – and then from others elsewhere in the Bible, as this realization set off a chain reaction of rethinking and rereading – that the anger he was beginning to feel at the forces that kept these people in poverty was a reflection of God’s own anger. His participation in the homeless shelter might subtly shift from being his good work on behalf of the poor to his sharing of their life and their struggle, working with and alongside them in their struggle against poverty, hunger and distress.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The transformation might not stop there. As he spends more time trying to work properly alongside the people in the shelter, he might begin to see that alongside the social and political forces that create the poverty traps into which these people have fallen, there are some traps of a more inward nature: ways in which, for some of them, their poverty, hunger and distress are bound up with such deep hurts as a blighted imagination, chronic hopelessness, an inability to value oneself, and so on. His participation in the shelter might begin to teach him that his earlier rejection of a spiritual interpretation of Luke’s blessings and woes in favour of a material interpretation was too simplistic, and that the links between material poverty and some forms of spiritual poverty are, at least some of the time, crucial even if complicated. He might return to the passage, and to other passages in the Bible, and try to understand more of what a spiritual interpretation of these blessings and woes might have to contribute to the material interpretation to which he had been won over. And so the cycle might go on, with his changed insights into the biblical passages once again changing the nature of his participation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">That something like this would happen should be no surprise. I know, for instance, that when writing this book, I often feel that I don’t really know what I think on some point until I write about it; then, when I have written something, I can see it clearly enough to see that it is wrong. And so I revise – only to discover that although what I have written is better, it now helps me see the issues more clearly, which helps me in turn to see that I am still wrong. This cycle can go on many times – so there are parts of this book that, in one form or another, I have written ten or eleven times.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The same happens in Christian life more generally. It is only when one seeks to put into practice one’s present theological understanding, and one’s present understanding of the Bible, that one discovers what one’s present understanding really is – and perhaps discovers some of its limitations and inadequacies. That can drive one back to look again at one’s interpretation of the Bible and at one’s ideas, and to revise them. It is not primarily in classrooms and academic studies that theology, and Christian interpretation of the Bible, is truly tested and refined, but in practice, in real-life pursuit of that Christlike love and justice that constitute the kingdom of the Father.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">‘Experience’ in theology is not the name of some faculty that delivers theological information independent of the Bible or the tradition. Rather, it is a name for what people discover, and go on discovering, as they live with faith in the world.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Natural theology</span></p>
				<p class="text">I have not, in this book, talked about one major area of theological discussion that relates to this question about the role of experience. That is, I have not discussed whether it is possible for people to attain any kind of theological truth prior to, or in the absence of, or logically independent from, their encounter with revelation – that is, their encounter with what God has done in Jesus Christ and witnessed to in the Scriptures. Does a person’s general experience of the world before or apart from their experience of God’s address in Christ, allow any knowledge of God? To put this into traditional terminology: is a ‘natural theology’ possible as well as a ‘revealed’ or ‘positive theology’?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I am limiting myself to two comments, here. In the first place, if my account of ‘knowledge of God’ back in Chapter 2 is correct, then the question is not whether unaided human reason can form proper <span class="italic">concepts</span> of God; it is whether human beings can, without the explicit help of revelation, learn to <span class="italic">live in the world</span> in certain ways – receiving their existence as a gift, recognizing themselves as loved, learning to become loving, and so on. And in the second place, if my account of knowledge of God is correct, then we are not asking about whether human beings without the explicit help of revelation can arrive at truth, since truth is not a matter of arrival but of constant journeying. The question is, rather, whether human beings can find themselves, without the explicit aid of revelation, travelling in the right direction – or being drawn out of themselves, beyond reliance upon their own resources, in the right ways.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">So, for me, to ask the question of natural theology is to ask whether, when people turn to Christ to be drawn by him into the life of God, they might discover that Christ says yes to much in the existing shape and direction of their lives, including the ways of seeing the world that inform their living. That, it seems to me, is a question that can’t be given a generalized, theoretical answer: it can only be answered by seeing what, in fact, happens in life after life.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-383" id="footnote-169-383-backlink">383</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-22-17"><span class="bold">Reading on the way to the Father: Vulnerability</span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Scripture, tradition, reason, experience</span></p>
				<p class="text">You will sometimes come across reference to ‘Scripture, tradition and reason’ or ‘Scripture, tradition, reason and experience’ as the three or four sources or authorities for theology. The threefold form seems to be Anglican in origin and gets attributed to the sixteenth-century divine Richard Hooker; the fourfold form is Methodist and gets attributed to John Wesley – though in both cases the neat formul  ation is a twentieth-century summary.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-384" id="footnote-169-384-backlink">384</a></span> In some discussions, the impression can be given that there are here four distinct <span class="italic">sources </span>from which theological claims can be generated, and that the theologian’s job is to know how to balance, integrate or prioritize the claims. So we might have the Bible telling us that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; tradition telling us that God is Triune; reason telling us that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent; and experience telling us that God is intimately present to us – and the theologian’s job would be to work out how all those go together.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In effect, this chapter has led to a rather different way of seeing the relationship between Scripture, tradition, reason and experience. We have been focused on Scripture, but I have argued that Scripture is properly read in conversation with tradition (‘ecumenism in time’, I called it), that it is properly read in the midst of the experience of pursuing love and justice in the world, and in general that it is properly read with attentiveness and readiness to have our ways of making sense disrupted and remade – that is, with what I called ‘rationality’ in Chapter 1, and can call ‘reason’ now. In other words, I don’t think that one should imagine Scripture, tradition, reason and experience as four co-ordinate sources of theological truth, but as four different aspects of the one journey into the knowledge of God that Trinitarian theology describes.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-385" id="footnote-169-385-backlink">385</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above">To read on the way to the Father is to read not simply for <span class="italic">in</span>formation, but rather trusting that the Bible, when read around Christ and in the Spirit, can be an engine of ongoing <span class="italic">trans</span>formation, individual and corporate. This ongoing biblical challenging and transformation of Christian life and vision is, Christian theologians claim, a central process by which Christians are brought closer to the truth of things: closer to the truth of Jesus of Nazareth, and closer to the truth of the divine life into which God invites the world in Jesus.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In Chapter 1, I wrote that Paul called the Corinthian community to take stock of themselves in the light of God’s address to them in Christ; in Chapter 2, I suggested that to have knowledge of God ‘consists in the ongoing process by which the believer’s love is actively shaped into ever deeper conformity to God’, and in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, I wrote of the Trinitarian belief that one is led deeper and deeper into true love and true justice as the Spirit enables one to hear ever more clearly the address of the Father spoken to the world in Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The reading of the Bible can be understood as part of this process of learning, part of the attempt to listen carefully to the address of God, and to allow one’s current ideas, expectations and habits of thought to be challenged and remade by it. Christian theology involves allowing oneself, one’s community, one’s world to be ‘put to the question’ by God’s address. And just as I have suggested that Christian life as a whole cannot be understood as static, or as involving the arrival at some plateau on which believers can expect no further challenge and no further learning, so too with the interpretation of the Bible. If the interpretation of the Bible is understood as an aspect of the kind of Christian life that I have been discussing, it will not be understood as involving the secure adoption of a set of final explanations and fixed ideas. It will not be understood as a talisman that will protect the theologian from all further questioning. In fact, quite the opposite: the proper pursuit of biblical interpretation will expose the theologian more and more thoroughly to searching questions.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">One could say that having the questioning address of God in Christ at the heart of Christian interpretation of the Bible will mean that Christian reading of the Bible will be characterized by both trust and suspicion. On the one hand, Christian readers will take their stand on a trust in what they have learnt above all from the Bible: that in Jesus Christ the world is truly being addressed by God. Christian theology will involve trusting that the Bible is a trustworthy witness to this, and that to order one’s life by the light of what one learns from the Bible is not an arbitrary or foolish thing to do. But alongside this trust Christian interpretation also involves suspicion: suspicion of one’s current understanding. Christian theologians may trust that God has spoken in Christ, and that the Bible witnesses to this truly, but that doesn’t mean they trust that <span class="italic">their present interpretation </span>of the Bible is perfect and complete, and does not need itself to be challenged, deepened and reformed.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian ideas – even when they are the schemes that Christians believe they have derived from the Bible – are not invulnerable. Christian theologians have to keep on listening, keep on looking again, in all the ways that I have discussed in earlier sections of this chapter. And they will keep on looking with the knowledge that they might find that they have been mistaken, that they have got things wrong, that they have oversimplified, that they have deceived themselves yet again.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Think again of the structure of Paul’s argument in his first letter to the Corinthians. Yes, he returns to the faith that the Corinthians were taught in the beginning; yes, he refers them back to a gospel that they already know. He does so, however, in such a way as to show that they have been misconstruing that gospel. He demonstrates that their use of gospel language to divide and exclude each other follows from their failure to understand what that language means – and then he takes them back to the sources of their faith and helps them reconstruct their theology on new lines. Christian theology is not and never can be immune from the need for such reconstruction, any more than any believer can claim that she has no more need of spiritual growth, nor a community claim that it has no more need of reformation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">This means that one of the fundamental characteristics of Christian theology should be <span class="italic">vulnerability</span>, in the sense of openness to challenge, willingness to discover that what one had taken to be right, what one had taken to be invulnerable, needs to be unsettled, overthrown and remade. To read the Bible on the way to the Father is to read with such vulnerability.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">You may be mistaken</span></p>
				<p class="text">In 1650, Oliver Cromwell led an English army into Scotland, where he believed that Scottish forces were assisting Charles Stuart, son of Charles I, in a bid for the English crown. In the bad weather of early August 1650 the conflict looked like a stalemate, with Cromwell failing to draw the Scottish forces out to fight while he still had supplies and men. The two sides seem to have been engaged in a propaganda war, with attempts being made to distribute leaflets among the opposing armies. One Scottish leaflet argued that God would ‘arise to execute judgement’ against the English if they persisted in their attack upon ‘those who in the integrity of their hearts have been following Jesus Christ’. One part of Cromwell’s reply to the Scots has become famous. You have sought to establish yourselves, he said ‘upon the Word of God. Is it therefore infallibly agreeable to the Word of God, all that <span class="italic">you</span> say? <span class="italic">I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken</span>.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-386" id="footnote-169-386-backlink">386</a></span> However incongruous the context in which it was first written, that last sentence could be a slogan for all Christian theology.</p>

					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">Debates about homosexuality in various churches, particularly in the Anglican Church, highlight the extremely controversial nature of the area I have been exploring in this chapter. What are the authoritative sources for Christian life and Christian moral vision? How should the Bible’s injunctions be interpreted? What do we do when Christians disagree in their interpretations? These are not matters of idle speculation: they are the root issues in debates that affect the lives of very large numbers of people. In so much of the debate, however, there is more heat than light, and it is difficult to get a clear view of the issues involved.

This preference brings out the gratuitous or unmerited character of God’s love. The same revelation is given in the evangelical Beatitudes, for they tell us with utmost simplicity that God’s predilection for the poor, the hungry and the suffering is based on God’s unmerited goodness to us.’ Gustavo Gutierrez, <span class="italic">A Theology of Liberation </span>(Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 1988), p. xxvii.</p>
