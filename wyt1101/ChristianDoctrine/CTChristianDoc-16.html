				<p class="text">All through this book I have been discussing the ways in which Christians can make sense of their lives and of their world as being drawn on a journey into the life of God, to share the life of God. In other words, the central topic of the whole book has been <span class="italic">reconciliation</span> – the (re)uniting of the world with God. To put it another way, the central topic of the whole book has been soteriology: the doctrine of <span class="italic">salvation</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In this chapter I am going to place salvation centre stage, and examine two facets of it that have so far only been implicit: the idea that Christians are saved specifically from sin, and the idea that Christ’s death and resurrection are the cause of their salvation.</p>

				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">To save something is to move it from peril to safety. I’m typing this chapter on a computer, and were the computer to crash these words would be lost. To ‘save’ the document is to put it beyond that peril by storing it in a form that can’t be touched by ordinary computer crashes. When I was at school, I don’t think I ever managed to ‘save’ a goal at football (which is probably why I’ve ended up as an academic) but had I done so it would have been by seeing off the peril of a particular goal being scored against my team. With both those examples, the simplest way to explain what ‘save’ means is by specifying what we are being saved <span class="italic">from</span> – loss of data, or the loss of the game. Those descriptions, however, can only make sense because we make some prior assumptions about what this saving is <span class="italic">for</span>: for the writing of this book, or for the winning of the game. Only because we have some idea of the good outcome that we would like to achieve, or the good state in which we would like to remain, can we make sense of the idea of something imperilling that good. Ideas about what we are saved <span class="italic">from</span> go hand in hand with ideas about what we are saved <span class="italic">for</span>. And those ideas are tied together by some idea of <span class="italic">how</span> the saving takes place: I get the computer to make a copy of my document in non-volatile memory, or on a storage device; I prevent the ball from crossing into the area where, by the rules of the game, it constitutes a point against my team. The <span class="italic">how</span> is tied to the <span class="italic">what from </span>and the <span class="italic">what for</span>.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is the same when we consider salvation in Christian theology. Ideas about what people are saved <span class="italic">from</span>, about what people are saved <span class="italic">for</span>, and about <span class="italic">how</span> people are saved are inseparable: a different vision of what people are saved for will suggest different ways of understanding the peril and the process by which it is avoided; a different understanding of the danger people are in will suggest different ways of seeing the kind of saving that is needed, and the good that will result when this danger is seen off.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The nature of the discussion earlier in this book makes it easiest to begin by asking what we are saved <span class="italic">for</span>. ‘Salvation’ comes originally from the Latin <span class="italic">salvare</span> which itself is connected to <span class="italic">salus</span>, ‘health’. Etymology is no guide to usage, and <span class="italic">salvare</span> soon came to mean ‘to rescue’ as much as to ‘heal’, but thinking about salvation in terms of health is no bad place to start. As<span class="italic"> </span>David Ford writes in <span class="italic">Self and Salvation</span>, ‘Health can be physical, social, political, economic, environmental, mental, spiritual, moral and so on.’ Salvation, if it is salvation of human beings in all their multifaceted existence, and ‘If it is understood to have to do with a God of creation’, will involve all these dimensions.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-248" id="footnote-169-248-backlink">248</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">The architecture of salvation</span></p>
				<p class="text">Some idea of the variety of Christian visions of the saved life can be gleaned from the different ways in which Christians have designed and built churches. To enter many Byzantine churches is to be drawn into a golden cave, filled with the light of candles illuminating icons of the saints and apostles; to be saved here is to enter the communion of saints as a novice initiated into mysteries. </p>
				<p class="text-indent">To enter a gothic cathedral is to find oneself in a garden of pillars, a stone Eden where every line draws one’s eyes upwards to the canopy of heaven; to be saved here is to participate with proper humility in a creaturely life in harmony with these heavenly heights. To enter a baroque church is to be confronted with a glorious vision, an explosion of light and ornament in which everything is caught and set in motion by the light streaming from God’s throne and from God’s eucharistic presence on earth; to be saved here is to share this rapturous vision, and reflect its light. To enter a neo-classical chapel is to find oneself in a space for preaching and sober reflection, a place of calm order and decorum; to be saved here is to become a pure hearer of the Word, and to live in untainted orderly obedience to it. To enter many modern churches is to come into a space designed for fellowship and families – chairs in the round and a coffee bar, perhaps; to be saved here is to be drawn into friendly fellowship with God and neighbour, away from pretension and obscurity.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">It should be no surprise, then, that in the Bible and the Christian tradition, there have been endless ways of speaking about and imagining the end that God has for the world: it is the possession of the pearl of great price; it is the homecoming; it is the great harvest; it is the return to Eden; it is the vision of God. It has been imagined as true peace – <span class="italic">shalom</span> – the kind of peace that is not simply the absence of strife, but the good order of a thriving community, at ease with itself and the world. It has been imagined as abundant feasting, a time of communal celebration and enjoyment. It has been imagined as initiation into true knowledge. It has been imagined as the arrival of a child at maturity, as the harmony of a symphony, as the coming of dawn. It is understood as the world’s inheritance of the life for which God intended it – a share in God’s own triune life. And it is understood as the triumph of goodness, truth and beauty: the triumph of the goodness of unimpeded fellowship between people, between people and their environment, between people and God; the triumph of that true knowledge of Creator and creatures which is the heart of human freedom; and the triumph of that beauty in which the light of Christ is visible in everyone and everything.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">What human beings are saved <span class="italic">from</span> is anything that militates against this life, this goodness, truth and beauty; anything that hinders its growth, anything that pulls people away from it, anything that makes it seem impossible: the breakdown of relationships between people, between people and their environment, between people and God; that ignorance which is not simply the absence of knowledge of particular facts, but illusion and delusion, distorted knowledge or misunderstanding; the failure to show the light of Christ in one’s life, or to see it in oneself or in others. Fear, imprisonment, distortion, incompleteness, futility, violence – all are forms of the breakdown or failure of godly life. Just as no one image captures all the dimensions of health, so no single, simple definition captures the peril from which Christian theology proclaims that human beings are saved: the problem is as multifaceted as the life that it undercuts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">As well as picturing what they are saved <span class="italic">from</span> and what they are saved <span class="italic">for</span>, Christians have pictured the <span class="italic">process</span> of salvation in any number of ways. They have used such images as reconciliation (re-creation of relationships where they have broken down), healing (putting right some disease or distortion, some virus corrupting the world’s software), liberation (setting free from hostile powers), sanctification (making holy; the nurturing of godly life), justification (no longer being counted as an outlaw or exile, but being reinstated as a member in good standing of the people), revelation (the communicating or uncovering of the truth), victory (the defeat of the forces that hold people back from salvation), ransom or redemption (the paying of some cost to free those who hold people captive),<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-250" id="footnote-169-250-backlink">250</a></span> propitiation (the appeasing of the wrath of God) or expiation (the expunging of impurity, dishonour or guilt by means of sacrifice).<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-251" id="footnote-169-251-backlink">251</a></span> As David Ford notes in the book cited above, language about this process can be drawn</p>
				<p class="quotes">from the religious cult (sacrifice), the law court (guilt, judgement and justification), warfare (victory), the marketplace (exchange, redeeming slaves or prisoners), the family (parent–child relationships, adoption), medicine (healing), history (exodus, exile), politics (satisfaction in relation to the honour of a superior, liberation from oppression), friendship (laying down life), and nature (light and darkness, seeds dying and bearing fruit). Many of these have been followed through with great intensity in imagination, thought, feeling and practice.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-252" id="footnote-169-252-backlink">252</a></span></p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-3"><span class="bold">Sin</span></p>
				<p class="text">When we are thinking about human beings as those who are the <span class="italic">victims </span>of all this peril, we call it ‘suffering’ – and the discussion of God’s response to suffering in the previous chapter was therefore already a discussion of salvation. However, if we are thinking about the ways in which this peril is the <span class="italic">result</span> of human activity (in the broadest sense) we consider it under the heading ‘sin’ – and Christian theological discussions have tended to use the word ‘salvation’ most of all when discussing this side of the world’s plight.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In the earlier chapters of this book I spoke at length about the positive Christian vision of life in God. All we need to do to start defining sin is to ask how human beings obstruct and impede that life. In the light of the doctrine of God that I explored in Chapter 2, one could think of sin as the failure or refusal of love: failure or refusal to recognize oneself as loved, failure or refusal to learn to love, failure or refusal to love. Sin is anything in human action that cuts off the circulation of love. In the light of the doctrine of creation that I discussed in Chapter 7, one could also think of sin as the failure or refusal to acknowledge creatureliness: the failure or refusal to recognize one’s utter dependency upon others, upon the wider environment and upon God, or the refusal or failure to recognize that the world in turn depends in part upon one – that one does have one’s own sphere of action and responsibility. In the light of the doctrine of the Spirit that I outlined in Chapter 6, one could think of sin as the failure or refusal to be or to recognize oneself as a gift to the body of Christ, or to receive others in the body of Christ as gifts. In the light of the doctrine of providence that I outlined in Chapter 8, one could think of sin as failure or refusal to attend and respond to the signs of God’s presence and activity in the world. In other words, one could take each of the positive doctrines that are explored elsewhere in this book, and ask how it is that human beings might fail or refuse to live according to this vision. ‘Sin’ is the name Christian theology gives to all that.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Pride</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">Feminist theologians have long criticized that resilient strand of the Christian tradition that claims that pride is the root form of sin. Valerie Saiving Goldstein, in a famous 1960 article, described the traditional picture, as she found it refracted in the work of contemporary theologians, in these terms:</p>
				<p class="quotes">Man’s freedom … brings with it a pervasive fear for the survival of the self and its values. Sin is the self’s attempt to overcome that anxiety by magnifying its own power, righteousness, or knowledge. Man knows that he is part of the whole, but he tries to convince himself and others that he <span class="italic">is</span> the whole. … Sin is the unjustified concern of the self for its own power and prestige; it is the imperialistic drive to close the gap between the individual, separate self and others by reducing the others to mere objects which can be treated as appendages of the self and manipulated accordingly.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-253" id="footnote-169-253-backlink">253</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">She argues that this is a plausible and powerful account of sin, but that it is one written primarily by men, for men. Describing the effects of the traditional nurturing roles that have dominated women’s lives, Saiving suggests that the paradigmatic problems for women in a patriarchal society are different:</p>
				<p class="quotes">A mother who rejoices in her maternal role … knows the profound experience of self-transcending love. But she knows, too, that it is not the whole meaning of life. … The moments, hours, and days of self-giving must be balanced by moments, hours, days of withdrawal into, and enrichment of, her individual selfhood if she is to remain a whole person. She learns … that a woman can give too much of herself, so that nothing remains of her uniqueness; she can become merely an emptiness, almost a zero without value to herself, to her fellow men, or, perhaps, even to God.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-254" id="footnote-169-254-backlink">254</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">The root form of sin in this situation is not pride, it is ‘underdevelopment or negation of the self’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-255" id="footnote-169-255-backlink">255</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Of course, ‘sin’ has tended to be the name given by Christians most of all to deliberate acts of transgression or omission – blameworthy acts by individuals who knew, or should have known, better. Theological discussion, however, takes a somewhat broader view. As well as the disordered action, theologians attend to the disordered motivations and desires that inspired or were expressed in the action, and the disordered vision or understanding that lies behind those desires. And that means that questions of blameworthiness or culpability get more complex. I know what it means to be responsible for my actions – but am I responsible in the same way for my desires and motivations? And am I responsible in the same way for my understanding or vision? My discussion of freedom in Chapter 8 should already have alerted you to ways in which these questions can be very difficult to answer, and so to ways in which even that initial affirmation about being responsible for my actions might be rather difficult to make without qualification. That is why the definition I originally gave of sin did not put blameworthiness or culpability centre stage: I spoke of ‘human activity (in the broadest sense)’ that denied or worked against the good that God has for the world. It should be clear that unconscious or well-meaning or coerced or accidental human action might fall into this category just as easily as the deliberate actions of some individual who knows he is doing wrong.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">One of the biblical passages that has become central in Christian thinking about sin is the story of Adam, Eve, and the serpent.</p>
				<p class="quotes">1Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, ‘Did God say, “You shall not eat from any tree in the garden”?’ 2The woman said to the serpent, ‘We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; 3but God said, “You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die.”’ 4But the serpent said to the woman, ‘You will not die; 5for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">6So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">8They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, ‘Where are you?’ 10He said, ‘I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.’ 11He said, ‘Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?’ 12The man said, ‘The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.’ 13Then the Lord God said to the woman, ‘What is this that you have done?’ The woman said, ‘The serpent tricked me, and I ate.’ …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">22Then the Lord God said, ‘See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever’ – 23therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 24He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>

				<p class="text-line-above">This is a story of things going wrong in Eden. Eden is portrayed as a land of flourishing relationships: flourishing relationships between people (Adam and Eve, made for each other as partners, who, as the end of chapter 2 tells us, live together in unashamed nudity), flourishing relationships between humans and the natural world (the picture is a pastoral one: they work the garden, living off its produce, naming and living alongside the animals), and flourishing relationships between humans and God (God walks among them in the garden planted for them). It is a land in which Adam and Eve are provided with an abundance (Adam works but he does not toil, and his and Eve’s needs are met in the garden). It is, finally, a land in which human beings have a vocation that makes them participants in God’s creative action (God plants the garden, but Adam is set to till it, working with what God provides to further its flourishing).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is when we ask how this idyll is destroyed that things get more confusing. This is, after all, a deeply perplexing text. No matter how many times I read it, and how many commentaries and expositions I read by other people, there remain knots in it that I don’t know how to untie. It is one of those texts that reminds me that the Bible does not simply make easy and effortless sense, and that even texts that have become crucial episodes in Christian tellings of the story of salvation can at times fit rather awkwardly into that story.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Reading this text as a Christian, who has inherited a tradition of reading that takes it as a foundational exposé of the nature of sin and punishment, I find myself faced with a host of interconnected questions.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-256" id="footnote-169-256-backlink">256</a></span> What is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Why is it there? What kind of knowledge does it give? What is wrong with gaining that kind of knowledge? What, exactly, is the sin that Adam and Eve commit? Is the problem for Adam and Eve simply their breaking of an arbitrary restriction that has been set for them as some kind of test? Or is there something inherently dangerous with eating from the tree, so that God’s command is more warning that ban?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">And what is the nature of the temptation to which Eve and Adam fall? One moment, it is represented as a temptation to ‘be like God’, the next (more mysteriously) as a temptation to gain knowledge and wisdom, and the next (rather prosaically) as the lure of fruit that looks good to eat.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Then there are the unexpected consequences. The serpent, speaking against God, has claimed that Adam and Eve will not die, and that their eyes will be opened; sure enough they do <span class="italic">not </span>die and their eyes <span class="italic">are </span>opened. But although the tree is called ‘the tree of the knowledge of good and evil’ the knowledge it conveys is clearly not knowledge of what is banned and what is allowed – Eve demonstrates in conversation with the serpent that she knows that much already. What she and Adam gain from the opening of their eyes is knowledge of their own nakedness, and an attending shame and fear: they gain shame when they see their nakedness, and fear when they realize that God is in the garden and will see their nakedness. Adam does not say to God, ‘I was afraid because I had disobeyed you,’ but ‘I was afraid <span class="italic">because I was naked</span>.’ What has happened? What has the fruit of this tree done to them?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">This shame, it seems to me, is a clue to a reading of this text that follows the Christian tradition in seeing this as a paradigmatic tale of sin and its punishment. What, after all, is shame? It has something to do with seeing yourself as you imagine others see you – an internalized version of the external scrutiny you imagine yourself to be under. And so it is indeed a form of knowledge, of self-knowledge (‘this is what I look like’) but it is knowledge without love. Shame involves a form of knowledge that sees accurately but judges harshly, a knowledge that consists in unforgiving scrutiny. Adam and Eve have their eyes opened, but apparently only to become aware for the first time of their naked precariousness – whether the emphasis is supposed to fall on the frailty that they discover in themselves, or whether it has more to do with their discovery of the uncontrollable nature of their desires. They see themselves accurately as finite, weak, needy or unreliable.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The fruit of the tree, we might say, makes them <span class="italic">judges </span>– and this is what, in this reading of the story, ‘knowledge of good and evil’ means. They do not gain information about what is right and wrong; they gain the stance of a judge who metes out sentences, condemning and accepting – the position that (as the story itself shows) belongs properly to God. Adam and Eve seek to stand in the place of God and then condemn themselves for not being gods. And in this, of course, they do see accurately (they <span class="italic">are</span> finite creatures, they are not gods) but they do not see <span class="italic">truly</span>: they do not see the proper dignity (rather than shame) of their position. In the light of the theology that I have been presenting in this book so far, we might say that Adam and Eve do not see the vocation for which they were created, to glorify God as creatures, to participate in the life of God as creatures. They do not see the love that binds the creator to his creatures and creatures to their creator. All they see is that they are creatures, and that there is a gulf fixed between them and their creator.</p>

A society that thinks beauty fits into ‘size 0’ is a society that has eaten fruit from the same tree as Eve.</p>

				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Knowledge that is accurate but untrue seems to be the hallmark of the serpent. After all, everything the serpent says is accurate, but it is only ever a partial picture. The serpent does not see or does not convey the whole picture, the context in which the things that it sees move. So, for instance, it accurately sees that Adam and Eve will not immediately die when they eat the fruit of the tree; it accurately sees that when they eat it their eyes will be opened and they will (as God later confirms) gain a kind of knowledge that belongs to God; it fails to see (or fails to tell) what the knowledge they gain will do to them. It will tip them into shame, into a cycle of blaming and accusing, into rivalry, into distorted relationships with each other, with God and with the world. They will begin to die.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Before ever any punishment has been imposed, the consequences of their action are seen in a disruption of their relationship with each other (shame, and a little later, blame), and a disruption of their relationship with God (fear). It would be possible (though perhaps a little too smooth) to see the explicit punishment that God later imposes as nothing more than a spelling out, a making concrete, of the damage that they have already done to themselves.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">What, then, does ‘sin’ look like in this passage? There is, of course, that first sinful action, which is a deliberate decision to do something that has been forbidden. The later actions of Adam and Eve, however – their hiding, their blaming – are no less actions that distort and destroy the harmony of Eden, and so no less sin. Yet they are more the outworking of now diseased understanding and loveless imagination than the deliberate transgression of commands. However simple sin may have been to start with, it has begun to metastasize.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-4"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Sin is anything in human activity that stands in the way of salvation.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Sin includes, but is not restricted to, deliberate acts of transgression.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Sin is also found in the outworking of distorted vision and disordered desires.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-5"><span class="bold">The power of sin</span></p>
				<p class="text">Sin is any human activity (in the broadest sense) that gets in the way of salvation: anything that gets in the way of fullness of life; anything that gets in the way of one’s being drawn deeper into the life of God. Imagine the life of God as a dance, with more and more people being drawn into the dance. To jab out your elbows, or to trip up your neighbours, disrupts the dance; it makes it impossible for you or for them to join in fully with the dance. That’s not because there is some stickler of a dance master who has unrealistic standards of perfection that he imposes on all the dancers, a master who sends you off if he doesn’t happen to like the way you move. Rather, it is inherent: if you behave like this, you break the dance. Similarly, ‘sin’ should not be thought of as the transgressing of any one of a long list of arbitrary rules set up by God to please Godself, but is simply anything that breaks the dance of participation in God’s life.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Certainly, deliberate transgressions of commands would disrupt things (‘I don’t care what the caller says, I’m going to step to the right now. Oops, sorry!’). But the dance could also be disrupted in more subtle ways. If you had been taught to dance in ways completely unsuited to this dance then, however much you were conscientious and willing, you might find that you could not help but disrupt the dance at first. On other occasions, you might simply find yourself caught up in the ripples of clumsiness and collision set off by somebody else’s mismove, unable to do anything but choose which of three people you’re going to collide with, or exactly where you are going to fall over. Or you might – to strain the metaphor a bit further – find that the environment you were dancing in had been erected by people who simply did not understand the dance (a room that was too narrow, or with a floor that was too slippery), and that try as you might you and those around you weren’t going to be able to dance properly until something had been done about the room.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">We can make all this more real if we think about racism as an example. Using our dance metaphor, racism would be the refusal or inability to dance properly with those of another race, even though they share the same dance floor with you. There are, of course, all too many deliberate racist acts committed knowingly by individuals. But what about someone who has been brought up in a culture saturated with negative images of those of other races? He might try to overcome that inheritance, but be all too aware even at the times when he is struggling to be most fair that it <span class="italic">is </span>a struggle for him: he cannot but <span class="italic">notice</span> people’s race, and only keeps above the racist assumptions he grew up with by an explicit act of will. He knows he can’t relax his vigilance, and so knows that that he simply is not ‘colour blind’: he simply is not able to behave entirely naturally with people of another race because he is too self-conscious about his need to do so.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Or what about someone working in an organization that relies very strongly upon personal recommendation by existing members when recruiting new members and when promoting people within the organization? She might find that however open she and her colleagues are to welcoming ethnic minorities into the organization, very few from those minorities actually make it in, and even fewer get promoted – because networks of interracial friendship are not yet pervasive enough in the surrounding society, and most people from ethnic minorities do not know existing members of the organization well enough to get their recommendations. And what if, in turn, one of the things preventing the growth of interracial friendships in their society is precisely the fact that people don’t meet many from ethnic minorities in the organizations of which they are a part?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In other words, racism can be a matter of deliberate individual transgressions, but it can also be more complicated: it can also be part of the way we are shaped by our upbringing and environment, and it can also be deeply embedded in the ways in which our society is organized – in ways which go well beyond any ideas of personal transgression and responsibility. We can speak of corporate racism, a racist culture, maybe even institutional or systemic racism – and in each case we are still talking about something that issues in patterns of human action that hold salvation at bay, and keep human beings from true flourishing together.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christians have long said that the sin from which human beings need saving is not simply to be found in deliberate individual acts of transgression, but rather is something deeper and wider – something that human beings inherit, and can’t avoid. Racism, for instance, is not simply my individual racist acts, but is the racist culture I grow up in (which beds down in me however much I try to avoid it) and the racist structures of the society I live in (which make eradicating racism at times almost impossibly difficult, even with immense good will and widespread good intentions). I need saving not just from the consequences of the particular sins I commit, but from the sinful air I breathe and the sinfulness of the world I inhabit.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is not therefore the product of some bizarre metaphysical speculation, or of the mistranslation of a verse in Romans 5, that Christian theologians have spoken of sin being inherited,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-257" id="footnote-169-257-backlink">257</a></span> of it infecting people prior to any responsible or irresponsible action of their own. It is the product of tracing back the circuits of sinful action and finding that they do not simply terminate in the sovereign wills of responsible individuals, but in this mess of influence and context in which those individuals are all embedded. Beyond the individual, culpably sinful act, there is the power of sin from which it takes its strength and direction – and Christian theology has called this power ‘original sin’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christian theology has at this point notoriously spoken about even tiny babies as infected with sin. A baby is born needing a loving environment in which to grow, so as to grow up herself to be loving. It does not happen automatically, and it does not happen all at once. There is nothing wrong with being a baby, nothing wrong with babies being as self-centred as they always and inevitably are, nothing wrong with them needing to grow into maturity, needing to grow into life and love. None of that is ‘sin’. But no baby born in our world is born into the wholly loving environment she would need in order to grow properly.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is not that the baby has somehow <span class="italic">done </span>something wrong – and the proponents of original sin do not say any different. The baby does, however, lack something: she lacks the environment she needs because she is part of the distorted, sinful human race. She stands in need of the salvation of that human race just as much as its older, less innocent members do, if she is to grow into the life that God has for her. The baby is born into a world with polluted air, and is bound to grow up with some degree or other of distortion, and to become part of the system that recycles this air. It is not her fault, but it is becoming part of who she is from the moment she is born – and it is most certainly something from which she needs to be saved. ‘Original sin’, if this is what we mean by it, is not so much a crime that deserves to be punished as a wound that needs to be healed.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">We saw that, in Genesis 3, the result of Adam and Eve’s sin is a kind of death: the rise of rivalry and evasion, of shame and fear, in the place of the relationships that constitute real life. That ‘death’ becomes the arena in which Adam and Eve’s children grow up, it beds itself down in them and shapes their perception of themselves, each other and their world; they breathe in this death and exhale it again themselves.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-258" id="footnote-169-258-backlink">258</a></span> And so on down the line. Adam’s sin, the traditional doctrine says, becomes the sin of all of us. Human beings would all still stand in need of salvation, even if the only particular act of sin (the only deliberate, individual transgression) ever committed was Eve’s – because even then this lack of sin would only be achieved by people pinching their noses and struggling not to live according to the death they are inevitably breathing in, the death that flows from that sin. Human beings stand in need of a change of air, and that’s not something they can produce themselves.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-7"><span class="bold">Grace</span></p>
				<p class="text">If the problem faced by humanity were simply the existence of culpable bad choices made by free individuals, it might make sense to think that human beings could simply pull their moral socks up and exercise their freedom more responsibly. They might need a wake-up call; they might need something to stiffen their resolve; they might need reminding of the standards of good and evil – but freedom from sin would ultimately rest in their own hands, and the biggest need would simply be for them to get on with acting well.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">If, on the other hand, we see sin in the disordered desires and distorted vision from which human actions emerge, then freedom from sin will be a more difficult goal to reach. Human beings will need to be <span class="italic">worked on</span> in order to be freed to do the good: they will need to have their vision corrected and their desires reoriented. Any talk of human beings as actively responsible for doing good will have to go hand in hand with (indeed, be carried by) talk of human beings as <span class="italic">recipients</span>, and of freedom from sin not as something achieved, but as something <span class="italic">given</span> – as ‘grace’, to use the traditional theological term.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Pelagius and Augustine</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">For the Western Church, the debate between Augustine of Hippo and Pelagius (a theologian from Britain) in the early fifth century put the question of grace at the top of the theological agenda. The historian Peter Brown describes the clash.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Like many reformers, the Pelagians placed the terrifying weight of complete freedom on the individual: he was responsible for his every action; every sin, therefore, could only be a deliberate act of contempt for God. Augustine was less sure that a fallen human nature could bear so great a weight: ‘Many sins are committed through pride, but not all happen proudly … they happen so often by ignorance, by human weakness; many are committed by men weeping and groaning in their distress. …’ The Catholic church existed to redeem a helpless humanity; and once the essential grace was given, he could accept with ease in his congregation the slow and erratic process of healing.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-259" id="footnote-169-259-backlink">259</a></span></p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">The basic difference between the two men, however, is to be found in two radically different views on the relation between man and God. It is summed up succinctly in their choice of language. Augustine had long been fascinated by babies: the extent of their helplessness had grown upon him … [and] he had had no hesitation in likening his relation to God to that of a baby to its mother’s breast, utterly dependent, intimately involved in all the good and evil that might come from this, the only source of life.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">The Pelagian, by contrast, was contemptuous of babies. ‘There is no more pressing admonition than this, that we should be called <span class="italic">sons</span> of God.’ To be a ‘son’ was to become an entirely separate person, no longer dependent on one’s father, but capable of following out by one’s own power the good deeds that he had commanded. The Pelagian was <span class="italic">emancipatus</span> <span class="italic">a deo</span>; it is a brilliant image taken from the language of Roman law: freed from the all-embracing and claustrophobic rights of the father of a great family over his children, these sons had ‘come of age’. They had been ‘released’, as in Roman Law, from dependence on the <span class="italic">pater familias</span> and could at last go into the world as mature, free individuals, able to uphold in heroic deeds the good name of their illustrious ancestry: ‘Be ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-260" id="footnote-169-260-backlink">260</a></span></p>
				<p class="Exercise-box-heading"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></p>
				<p class="text">Pause for a moment to decide where you stand. Are you more with Pelagius or more with Augustine? Wholeheartedly or with caveats and qualifications? Do you see any dangers in the side for which you have opted?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">If one is to grasp these points, it is important not to fall back into inadequate ways of thinking about human action and divine action, or human freedom and divine freedom. You will remember from my discussion of providence and freedom that it is a mistake to think of human and divine action as competing with one another, so that human beings would be active only where God is not, and God active only where they are not. I spoke of human freedom not as a<span class="italic"> </span>freedom from God’s control, a freedom consisting entirely in the absence of constraint, but of freedom as a matter of dependence upon truth and love. The only kind of freedom available to human beings is being dependent in ways that are not mired in delusion, and in ways that do not subordinate them to the interests of another.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Being passive, being recipients, being dependent – these are not states in which human beings find themselves only when they are not acting. They are present <span class="italic">in </span>all human action. All human action emerges from desires, understanding and circumstances that the actors did not ultimately choose for themselves. And all human action starts chains of consequences going in the world over which the actors will have little or no control. To speak about freedom from sin as a gift, as something human beings receive, is not to say that human beings are normally active and in control, but in this context must become passive and dependent. Human beings are always dependent, even when they are active – and the only question that matters is dependence <span class="italic">upon what</span>, or <span class="italic">upon whom</span>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Trent</span></p>
				<p class="text">Some Protestant polemics would make you think that this is a point on which Protestants and Catholics differ, and that only Protestants insist on the priority of divine action or on absolute human dependence. A quick glance at the Council of Trent, the sixteenth-century Council in which the Roman Catholic Church stated its case against the Reformation, should be enough to puncture this myth.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Canons concerning justification:</p>
				<p class="quotes">1. If anyone says that a person can be justified before God by his own works, done either by the resources of human nature or by the teaching of the law, apart from divine grace through Jesus Christ: let him be anathema.</p>
				<p class="quotes">2. If anyone says that divine grace through Jesus Christ is given solely to enable a person to live justly and to merit eternal life <span class="italic">more easily</span>, as if each could be done through free will without grace, even though with a struggle and with difficulty: let him be anathema.</p>
				<p class="quotes">3, If anyone says that, without preceding inspiration of the holy Spirit and without his help, a person can believe, hope, love and repent, as he ought, so that the grace of justification may be granted to him: let him be anathema.</p>
				<p class="source">Council of Trent, <span class="italic">Decree on Justification</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">The disagreement between the Protestant Reformers and the Roman Catholic teaching of Trent is not about whether God’s grace has absolute priority: it is about what happens next. The next canon is one that the Reformers could not have accepted:</p>
				<p class="quotes">4. If anyone says that a person’s free will when moved and roused by God gives no co-operation by responding to God’s summons and invitation to dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification; and that it cannot, if it so wishes, dissent but, like something inanimate, can do nothing at all and remains merely passive: let him be anathema.’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-261" id="footnote-169-261-backlink">261</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">In the Tridentine position, God’s prevenient grace, working purely according to God’s good pleasure and not in reponse to any merit or openness on the part of the human subject, as it were repairs and switches on the broken free will of that subject. Once that has happened, however, the subject can use that awakened freedom either to co-operate with, or to reject, the ongoing work of God’s grace that leads the person to salvation. It is this that Protestants have traditionally rejected.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">Christian theology claims that God is at work to save human beings from sin, to free people from destructive and distorting dependencies. As I said in the chapter on the Spirit,</p>
				<p class="quotes">whenever Christians acknowledge God as Father, whenever they grasp what God is doing with them and for them, drawing them to himself as his children, that simply <span class="italic">is </span>the work of the Spirit.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">and</p>
				<p class="quotes">Whenever someone is being led deeper into conformity to Christ, whenever someone is being formed alongside Christ for life with the Father, that simply <span class="italic">is </span>the Spirit at work: that is the power of God’s life, drawing that person to God.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Growth into godly life or ‘sanctification’ as it is known, even when it is a change in the patterns of human <span class="italic">action</span>, a change in which human beings are active participants, is seen by Christians as entirely the gift of God’s Spirit, drawing them deeper into the life of God. Sanctification is God giving God’s own life to God’s creatures.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, being creatures, the only ways they have of receiving that gift are creaturely. Changes in the patterns of human vision, desire and action find their way into human lives along the connections that embed each human life in its context. Grace works its way into human beings through what they see, hear, taste, touch and smell: that’s what it means to be a creature. Theologians have expressed this by saying that God’s grace is always ‘mediated’ to human beings, that there are always ‘means’ of God’s grace – means by which that grace finds its way into human lives. Even if we were to imagine God stepping in and acting upon someone directly, without mediation, that action could only become real in the person’s life once it had become a pattern of change in the embodied life in the world which that person is – and so, in that way at least, become ‘mediated’ again.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Nevertheless, to say that these creaturely influences and triggers are ‘means of grace’<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-262" id="footnote-169-262-backlink">262</a></span> is to say that they are tools in the hands of God, and that ultimately, whatever means God uses, the healing of human beings from sin is received from the hands of God. It is God, Christians say, who is at work to overcome the sin that has sabotaged God’s creatures’ sharing of God’s life. It is God who steps over the barriers that human beings have individually and collectively created to participation in God’s life. God takes the initiative, and whatever movement there might be of human beings back to God depends utterly upon a prior movement of God towards human beings. ‘We love because he first loved us’, as 1 John 4.19 puts it. The world is enabled to share in the life of God only because God has first shared God’s life with the world. For Christian theology, the root and source of any and all salvation is God giving God’s own life to the world, making it real and active in a world that is resistant and antagonistic towards it.</p>

				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-9"><span class="bold">Salvation in Christ</span></p>
				<p class="text">And so we return to the core theme of this book: the root and source of any and all salvation that is God’s gift of God’s life to the world, by Christ and the Spirit. In the next three sections of this chapter I will focus on one question about this that has been central in Christian thinking about salvation. What exactly is the role of Jesus in salvation – and, specifically, what is the role of Jesus’ <span class="italic">death</span>?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The Protestant theologians Martin Bucer (1491–1551) and Andreas Osiander (1498–1552) developed a framework for thinking about this question that has become very influential. They drew on a bit of medieval and patristic biblical exegesis, which noted the different categories of people who are portrayed as ‘anointed’ in the Old Testament, and who can therefore be seen as forerunners of the Messiah (that is, the ‘anointed one’). Jesus, they said, can be thought of as <span class="italic">prophet</span>, as <span class="italic">priest</span>, and as <span class="italic">king</span>. Bucer wrote:</p>
				<p class="quotes">Just as they used to anoint kings, priests and prophets to institute them in their offices, so now Christ is king of kings, highest priest, and chief of the prophets. He does not rule in the manner of an external empire; he does not sacrifice with brute beasts; he does not teach and admonish only with an external voice. Rather, by the Holy Spirit he directs minds and wills in the way of eternal salvation; by the Spirit he offered himself as an expiatory sacrifice for us, so that we too might become an acceptable offering to God; and by the same Spirit he teaches and admonishes, in order that those destined for his kingdom may be made righteous, holy and blessed in all things.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-263" id="footnote-169-263-backlink">263</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Jesus, we might say, is a prophet to the extent that his life, death and resurrection cure people’s distorted vision. His life, death and resurrection can be thought of as <span class="italic">showing</span> them God, and showing them their true nature – showing them true divinity and true humanity. Within the whole narrative of his life, death and resurrection, the cross is a focal point of this showing: it is there that they see the ‘foolishness’ of God; it is there that they see that God’s life, and true human life, consists not in self-assertion but in self-giving. By showing them true godly life, Christ’s life, death and resurrection awaken and reorient their desires: however slow they are to learn, his life teaches them to love love. This is not simply the presentation of a moral example that shows them how to live, nor a demonstration that allows them to understand what God is like – it is a therapy for broken eyes and hearts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus is king to the extent that he is understood to be the living lord of one’s life, and to the extent that one’s life is thought of as discipleship to this master. Christians believe that it is in ongoing, constantly renewed following of Jesus that true flourishing is to be found. Christian life is thought of as life under the lordship of Jesus, or life under Jesus’ reign, which is the kingdom of God. Jesus’ life, death and resurrection can be thought of as establishing a colony of God’s kingdom in the midst of the realm of the enemy. The cross, in this light, can be thought of as a victory over that enemy kingdom – as long as one recognizes that it is a strange kind of victory. Jesus refused to obey the laws of rivalry, violence and self-protection by which this enemy’s world runs; he lived <span class="italic">in </span>this world, but he lived as a citizen of a different country. The cross is what happens to those who refuse the ways of this world: they are crushed and discarded. Jesus’ victory, however, did not consist in violent overthrow. It consisted in remaining faithful to the kingdom of God, even to the point of death. The cross is an act of supreme resistance, and the resurrection is God’s refusal to allow this resistance to vanish: in the resurrection, God takes Jesus’ resistance on the cross and makes it the beachhead of God’s kingdom on earth – giving it the future that Jesus’ persecutors thought they had cut off.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is when we come to consider Christ as priest that matters become more contentious.</p>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-10"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jesus can be seen as a prophet to the extent that his life, death and resurrection heal distorted vision and understanding.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">For the prophetic understanding of Jesus, salvation is a matter of revelation.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">Jesus can be seen as a king to the extent that his life, death and resurrection establish the kingdom of God in the midst of the world.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">For the kingly understanding of Jesus, salvation is a matter of resistance and victory.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-11"><span class="bold">Sacrifice and substitution</span></p>
				<p class="Normal" xml:lang="en-GB">Jesus is priest to the extent that his life and particularly his death are seen as a sacrifice on the world’s behalf. Sacrifices could mean many things in the ancient Jewish and Roman worlds, but the most relevant idea seems to be of sacrifice as a response to impurity, dishonour and transgression. The person who transgressed or who became impure or dishonoured needed to be expelled from the people and the presence of God. The appropriate sacrifice could prevent their expulsion or allow their reinstatement: it either placated God, so that he turned away his wrath, or it took away the impurity. That is, a clean animal would be sacrificed as a substitute – either giving God a life to placate his wrath, or having the impurity transferred to it and destroyed or expelled with it. For the earliest Christians, brought up in a world where sacrifices like this were a pervasive reality, sacrifice would have needed no explanation: it would simply have been obvious, one of the ways that the world works – and it would have been an easily available metaphor for speaking of what had happened with Christ. And it is worth noting that such sacrifice is not a judicial process; it is not about legal condemnation, sentencing and acquittal; it does not work by what we would recognize as a logic of guilt and punishment – it has a cultic logic of its own, not a logic borrowed from the law courts.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The metaphor allowed early Christians to capture in a graphic image the idea that Jesus was pure, and that his life and death had become the source of new life with God for those who had been estranged from God. At the heart of this image were ideas of substitution or exchange. He had shared his life with sinners so that sinners could share his life with God. He, the pure one, had suffered and died, and now they, the impure ones, had been made alive. He had become the victim of sin and sin’s consequences, so that they might be given a life freed from the power of sin.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Of course, if one presses this metaphor then questions start to arise about quite <span class="italic">how</span> this substitution works. Is it that God’s anger is placated by this offering? Is it that sinners’ impurities are somehow transferred to Jesus? The use of the metaphor by early Christians did not require that they had any clear or plausible answer to either of those questions: the metaphor enabled them to grasp and convey the basic <span class="italic">shape</span> of what had happened, rather than necessarily providing an explanation of <span class="italic">how or why</span> it happened.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is important to remember that this talk of Jesus as priest, or of his life and death as a sacrifice, is metaphorical – just as is the description of his life and death as the victorious founding of a beachhead in enemy territory, or the description of them as a therapy for distorted vision and disordered desire. As I stressed at the beginning of this chapter, Christians have employed a bewildering variety of metaphors or analogies to make sense of salvation, and in particular to make sense of Jesus’ role in salvation. If Jesus’ life, death and resurrection are the life of God come into the world, then we might expect them to be ungraspable and inexhaustible, capturable only in the clash and cacophony of a thousand inadequate images. Sacrifice imagery would have been particularly strong in the New Testament period – to observe or be involved in animal sacrifices must have been a powerfully visceral experience (if you will pardon the pun) – but that does not mean that Christ’s death simply is, literally and straightforwardly, a sacrifice or that the logic of sacrifice explains exactly how and why Jesus had to die.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">As the centuries went by, Christianity moved from a world dominated by cultic sacrifices (whether Jewish, Graeco-Roman, or those of the peoples beyond the Roman Empire to which Christianity spread) to one in which real sacrifices were rare or absent. Sacrifice ceased to be a living, meaningful reality in most Christian’s lives, and so the language of sacrifice stopped making immediate, visceral sense. Christians began looking for other metaphors or analogies that would help them <span class="italic">explain </span>the Bible’s sacrificial imagery – help them bring it alive again. And the key source to which they turned was the world of the law court: the judicial, forensic or penal world.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">The basic storyline of sacrificial substitution began to become one of <span class="italic">penal</span> substitution – substitution of the one punished. We have been judged guilty, this new story says, and have been sentenced to death. Christ, however, though innocent, is willingly killed in our place, taking the punishment that should have been ours. The sentence has been executed, judicial wrath is satisfied, and we the guilty may go free.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Calvin on substitution</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">In the sixteenth century, when the great Reformer John Calvin wrote his long exposition of the Christian faith, <span class="italic">The Institutes of the Christian Religion</span>, he gave a powerful and influential summary of the problem of sin, and of the solution provided by penal substitution. ‘[C]ondemned, dead, and lost in ourselves,’ he said, we ‘seek righteousness, liberation, life and salvation in Christ’ (II.xvi.1) – but we must ‘earnestly ponder how he accomplishes salvation’.</p>
				<p class="quotes-line-below">No one can descend into himself and seriously consider what he is without feeling God’s wrath and hostility toward him. Accordingly he must anxiously seek ways and means to appease God, and this demands a satisfaction … God’s wrath and curse always lie upon sinners until they are absolved of guilt. Since he is a righteous Judge, he does not allow his law to be broken without punishment, but is equipped to avenge it. (II.xvi.1)</p>
				<p class="quotes-line-below">All of us … have in ourselves something deserving of God’s hatred. … But because the Lord wills not to lose what is his in us, out of his own kindness he still finds something to love. However much we may be sinners by our own fault, we nevertheless remain his creatures. (II.xvi.3)</p>
				<p class="quotes">This is our acquittal: the guilt that held us liable for punishment has been transferred to the head of the Son of God. We must, above all, remember this substitution, lest we tremble and remain anxious throughout life – as if God’s righteous vengeance, which the Son of God has taken upon himself, still hung over us. (II.xvi.5)<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-264" id="footnote-169-264-backlink">264</a></span></p>

				<p class="text">Before reading on, decide what you think of this. Do you think it is a coherent and plausible account of Christ’s atoning work? Can you see any problems with it?</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">This has become probably the most pervasive way of telling the story of Jesus’ place in salvation in the modern world – and also one of the most controversial. Several serious and interlocking questions have been posed to it, some of which would also apply to the sacrificial substitution which penal substitution is intended to interpret, some of which are specific to the penal model.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In some crude versions of the substitutionary story, the wrathful Father demands punishment or sacrifice, and the merciful Son placates the Father by meekly providing it. This has, famously, been called ‘cosmic child abuse’,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-265" id="footnote-169-265-backlink">265</a></span> and it is not difficult to see why. More thoughtful versions of the penal substitution story, however, stress that the Father and the Son act in concert, providing in their shared mercy the substitute that their shared justice demands. As John Stott, a staunch defender of penal substitution, put it, ‘it is the Judge himself who in holy love assumed the role of the innocent victim, for in and through the person of his Son he himself bore the penalty which he himself inflicted’.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-266" id="footnote-169-266-backlink">266</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Nevertheless, there is a more serious charge here. It appears that God’s justice and God’s mercy are pitted against one another. On the one hand God is merciful and loving and wants to forgive, and on the other God is holy and righteous and has to condemn. In some presentations of penal substitution, these are presented as two sides of God’s character that are equal, opposed and balanced, such that whatever God does must equally express both sides. The righteous God, justly wrathful against human sin, must punish it, and will not forgo this punishment because to do so would be to abandon justice – and yet this same God is merciful, and desires the salvation of sinners, and so takes the punishment upon himself.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It has been argued that it is thanks in part to the effect on our imaginations of centuries of reflection on the gospel presented in these terms that we now naturally assume that justice and mercy are opposed in other areas of our life – in penal policy, for instance, where we assume that the demands of forgiveness and mercy pull in one rather unrealistic direction, but the implacable demands of righteous punishment pull in quite another. It has been suggested, in particular, that the prevalence of this kind of theology – its pervasiveness in hymns and sermons and prayers and books – has fed our society’s belief that punishment is fundamentally <span class="italic">retribution</span>: the automatic and necessary paying back in punishment of the wrong that someone has done, with any other effects of the punishment – deterrence of others, reformation of the guilty party, restoration of the relationships broken by the crime – strictly secondary.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-267" id="footnote-169-267-backlink">267</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is, however, no need to see justice and mercy opposed in this kind of way. More careful discussions of penal substitution certainly talk both of God’s wrath and of God’s love – but they are not presented as equal and opposite forces, which God somehow has to balance. Rather, God’s love is absolutely and completely primary: God is love – and ‘wrath’ (or righteous anger) is simply an expression of God’s love. If God is drawing the world to Godself in love, then God must work against all that keeps the world from being drawn together in love – God <span class="italic">must</span> work against sin, seeking to destroy it; God must <span class="italic">hate </span>it. God hates what destroys the world, because God loves the world; God’s wrath is directed against what constricts and reduces our life, because God’s desire is for the fullness of our life. God’s ‘wrath’ is not the flaring of God’s tetchy temper at things that happen to irritate God, but rather is the name we give to the inevitable fact that, for God to be loving, God’s will must be set against all that prevents love. ‘Love’ and ‘Wrath’, ‘Mercy’ and ‘Justice’ are not opposed forces in God; they are not even opposite sides of the same coin: ‘wrath’ is simply and only one of the ways in which God’s love works itself out, ‘justice’ simply and only one of the ways in which God’s mercy works itself out.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">In order to understand where that leaves penal substitution, we need to examine another criticism that has been made. And we can best approach that criticism by looking at this passage from a fairly typical popular presentation of penal substitution, culled from an American evangelistic website:</p>
				<p class="quotes">If you and I were in prison and on death row (looking to be executed soon), and you felt compassion on me and would like to be my substitute and take my place at the electric chair, do you think the chief officer of the prison would let you take my place so I could go free? No, he would not! Why? Who then would take your place, for you deserve to be punished in the same way? The only way anyone could be considered to take another’s place in prison on death row is if he is not guilty of a crime and is not on death row.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-268" id="footnote-169-268-backlink">268</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">As it stands, and stated as bluntly as this, this is clearly nonsense. What do <span class="italic">you</span> think would happen if an innocent party offered to take the place of a convict on death row?</p>
				<p class="text-indent">One can certainly imagine a <span class="italic">fine </span>being paid by somebody other than the person fined – at least, if the fine were imposed primarily in order to ensure that the cost created by the crime should be met.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-269" id="footnote-169-269-backlink">269</a></span> When one turns away from fines to the death penalty, however, I find it impossible to see how the logic is supposed to work. What kind of system of justice would be satisfied if it got a death, any death, regardless of whether it was the guilty person who died? What kind of system of justice would be <span class="italic">more </span>satisfied with the death of an innocent person than with the death of the mass murderer it has condemned?</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">There may be some system in which this makes sense, but it will not be a system of <span class="italic">justice</span>: the penal metaphor will need to be abandoned. The crucial phrase in Calvin’s presentation is ‘the guilt that held us liable for punishment has been transferred to the head of the Son of God’. ‘Transference of guilt’ is not an idea that makes sense in a law court: it is an idea from the realm of sacrifice, describing one of the mysterious transactions that were believed to lie at the heart of sacrifice. The change from sacrificial to penal metaphors has not actually taken us any further forward.</p>

				</table>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">There is, however, another way forward. We can, I think, imagine a situation in which a severe punishment is imposed not as a way of enacting retribution – not as a way simply of giving a criminal ‘what he deserves’, full stop – but rather as a way of working towards the healing of all those who have been harmed by the criminal’s actions. We can imagine a rationale for a severe punishment which says that, sadly, there is no other way in which the harm done can be contained, its effects limited and to a certain extent undone, and the criminal himself prevented from further harming himself, his victims, and the surrounding society, than by this severe punishment being carried out.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">I think that we can, in that case, imagine a stranger turning up who says: ‘Hang on, there <span class="italic">is</span> another way. There is another way in which we can achieve the same containment and healing of the harm done – in fact, a way in which we can achieve an even greater healing, a deeper healing. It will meet the needs of the victims, of the criminal, of the surrounding society, at least as deeply as the severe punishment you were contemplating. It will do all that you were hoping the punishment would do: it will bring the criminal face to face with the enormity of what he has done; it will comfort and reassure his victims; it will uphold a proper sense of what is right and wrong in the surrounding society … everything. And yet the criminal will not need to be severely punished for this to happen. Of course, this comes with a cost, but I’m entirely willing to pay that cost …’</p>
				<p class="text-indent">For the moment, let me bracket out the obvious question as to <span class="italic">how</span> this stranger’s miracle cure might be supposed to work and <span class="italic">what</span> the cost is. Let me simply concentrate on the logic of the claim itself. I think we can make sense of what is being said here. That is, I do not think it is obvious nonsense in the same way that the ‘death row’ example appears to be.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Note that this argument <span class="italic">only </span>makes sense, however if one has a particular view of punishment – one which, I suspect, is not the most widespread or most deeply embedded view of punishment in our society. More explicitly than most versions of penal substitution that I have come across, it requires one to think about punishment in a more liberal rather than a more conservative direction, seeing punishment as directed towards the healing of all concerned, rather than punishment having an intrinsic, obvious retributive logic and needing no further justification.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Anselm and satisfaction</span></p>
				<p class="text">It is worth noting that one of the key figures in the rise of the penal substitution model for salvation, Anselm of Canterbury, did not really teach substitutionary <span class="italic">punishment</span> at all. For Anselm, a person who sinned against another owed that person ‘satisfaction’: the restoration of whatever had been taken from the victim (including a restoration of the honour of the victim that had been impugned). Only if this ‘satisfaction’ (as it was called) could not be paid would the criminal need to be punished. For Anselm, it is not that Jesus is <span class="italic">punished</span> in our place, but rather that Jesus voluntarily pays the <span class="italic">satisfaction </span>that we are incapable of paying, so that <span class="italic">no one</span> needs to be punished.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-270" id="footnote-169-270-backlink">270</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="text-indent-line-above">Note that, although the story that I have told involves a kind of substitution, it is not quite as straightforward a substitution as the classical doctrine suggests. It is, in the reconstruction I have given, not so obvious that the cost the stranger is willing to pay must be exactly the same as the severe punishment the criminal will be avoiding: it is a lot less obvious that it is appropriate to describe the stranger’s solution straightforwardly and directly as a simple transference of the punishment from the criminal to the stranger – or rather more obvious that to describe it as involving such a transference is no more than a metaphor.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">However, all this will only make sense if one has some plausible content to give to the stranger’s claim. It will make sense only if one has some way of understanding how what the stranger proposes will have the effects that he claims, and will involve the cost that he sets out. In other words, even if the reconstruction of penal substitution that I have given works, there is a big gap at the middle of it. If the reconstruction I have given is going to work, then we are going to need to fill in that gap somehow, by turning to other metaphors and stories and analogies and explanations.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Classic penal substitution is normally taken to be a basic way of explaining how human beings are saved: it may not say everything that needs to be said, its proponents aver, but it does make sense in its own terms; you can proclaim penal substitution to somebody and expect them to be able to make sense of it without needing to be introduced immediately to any other models of salvation. The penal substitution model is, it is claimed, a plausible way of making sense of the substitutionary shape of the gospel story to audiences for whom sacrifice is no longer a living reality.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet it has this hole at its centre that cannot be filled in penal terms. The penal story is good on stressing the seriousness of sin, God’s hatred of it and the inevitable cost of dealing with it. It is good on insisting that Jesus (or at least his death) is not simply illustrative of salvation, but necessary to it, so that in some sense the world’s salvation has already been achieved by Christ on the cross – points to which we shall be returning. But it does not actually provide any model or analogy – in fact, the model it tries to provide obviously breaks down – when it tries to suggest <span class="italic">how </span>this particular cost is necessary, or how Christ’s death is a relevant price to pay.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-271" id="footnote-169-271-backlink">271</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">We need to look elsewhere if we are to plug this gap. In the previous section, under the headings ‘King’ and ‘Prophet’, I suggested some directions in which one might look for such models or analogies; in the next section, I have tried to fill out those hints a little more fully.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="box-heading" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="bold">Three views</span></p>
				<p class="text-line-below">It has become commonplace to speak of there being three main theories of the atonement:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">the ‘Latin’, ‘objective’, ‘Anselmian’, ‘satisfaction’ or ‘substitution’ theory;</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">the ‘subjective’, ‘Abelardian’, ‘moral influence’ or ‘exemplarist’ theory; and</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">the ‘Orthodox’, ‘classical’, ‘ransom’ or ‘Christus Victor’ theory.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-272" id="footnote-169-272-backlink">272</a></span></li>
				</ol>
				<p class="text-line-above">Roughly speaking, the first of these is the theory that I examined in this section, relating to Christ as priest; the second relates to what I said in the previous section in relation to Christ as prophet, and the third to what I have said in that section in relation to Christ as king.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The commonplace presentation suggests that the ‘Christus Victor’ theory dominated for the first thousand years of Christianity, until (in the West) changes in intellectual and social culture prompted two new, but opposed theories: the Anselmian (which became the Western orthodoxy) and the Abelardian (which was regarded as defective or heretical until the modern period, when it became the standard liberal theological approach).</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Widespread though this narrative is, it is deeply misleading, not least because Anselm, Abelard and their Patristic forebears had a good deal more in common than this narrative supposes. For Abelard and Anselm, Caroline Walker Bynum writes:</p>
				<p class="quotes">Both Anselm and Bernard [of Clairvaux] in fact agree with Abelard that empathetic participation in Christ’s suffering arouses humankind to a love that is the first step towards return and reconciliation. Moreover, Abelard himself … speaks … of Christ’s love providing justification – that is, offering something objective that repairs the chasm opened in the universe by sin. Like Bernard and Anselm, Abelard sees both the cross and the mass as sacrifice and satisfaction. In other words, there are subjective and objective elements in the theories of both Anselm and Abelard. Indeed, to all twelfth-century thinkers, Christ’s suffering on the cross both induces response and effects ontological repair; it wrenches the hearts of humans towards empathy and healing, and it provides a totally undeserved and God-given bridge across the breach torn in the cosmos by Adam’s disobedience in the garden of Eden. … There are not two redemption theories (Abelardian and Anselmian) in the Middle Ages but one.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-273" id="footnote-169-273-backlink">273</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above-and-below">For Anselm and the Patristic tradition, David Bentley Hart writes:</p>
				<p class="quotes">the closer the attention one pays Anselm’s argument, the harder it becomes to locate the exact point at which he supposedly breaks from patristic orthodoxy. The divine action follows the same course as in the ‘classic’ model: human sin having disrupted the order of God’s good creation, and humanity having been handed over to death and the devil’s rule, God enters into a condition of estrangement and slavery to set humanity free. … Formidable linguistic shifts aside, Anselm’s is not a new narrative of salvation.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-274" id="footnote-169-274-backlink">274</a></span></p>
				<hr/>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-12"><span class="bold">Key points</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list">The penal model of substitution arose as a way of trying to explain the Bible’s sacrificial language.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The model does not explain how guilt can be transferred to Jesus.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list">The model can be salvaged if the ‘punishment’ is understood as the paying of the costs inherent in the restoration of sinners and victims to flourishing life.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="Heading-A" id="toc_marker-17-13"><span class="bold">Transfiguring acceptance</span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">Because God loves the world and desires to draw it into love, Christians believe that God must hate all that keeps the world from love. When faced with people who have grown up in polluted air, so twisted and distorted by sin as to be incapable, to one degree or another, of the love to which they are called, the God in whom Christians believe cannot simply be indifferent to their plight. God yearns and strives for the healing and remaking of these lives.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Christians have sometimes put this quite starkly. God, they have said, desires to kill my ‘old self’, my distorted and self-centred or self-hating self; and God desires to create for me a ‘new self’: a self open to others, a self resting in the knowledge that it is loved and unrestricted in its capacity to love. God desires my crucifixion and my resurrection.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The incarnation is, according to Christian theology, God’s way of doing this. God saves the world by living in its midst a fully reconciled life: a life that is unrestricted in its capacity for love, wholly aware that it is loved, wholly caught up in love for God and wholly caught up in love for the world that God loves: a life that refuses to defend a safe location for itself in the world and also refuses to declare itself irrelevant and let itself disappear; a life that is lived for others, and which takes the inevitable shape that such selflessness takes in a world like ours: the journey to the cross.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Human beings encounter true humanity in Jesus, and that encounter both judges them (showing how their lives should look but do not) and calls them (showing them the true form that their lives can take, by God’s grace). Believers respond by accepting Jesus as their judge and as their saviour – that is, by saying in response to the judgement that they encounter in him: ‘Yes, kill my old self!’; and by saying, in response to the full life they see in him: ‘Yes, bring me alive with you!’ They commit themselves to the way of the cross and the way of resurrection: going down with Christ into the grave, and leaving their old selves there, and rising with Christ to new life, learning to be loved and to love. The processes by which these things happen are not abstruse metaphysical transactions or mystical infusions; they are the encounters and relationships that one can see portrayed in the Gospels. They are what happen when people meet Jesus, and are transformed.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jesus is, in this understanding, God’s way of loving the world because he is God’s way of killing people and God’s way of bringing them back to life. Looking at those whom he is saving, God sees not so much what they are, as what they will be – God sees their unChristlikeness condemned and destroyed, and their Christlikeness fulfilled. To put it in more traditional language, God sees Christ’s righteousness, not their sinfulness, not because that righteousness is already complete in them, but because this is what God has declared in Christ that God will do in them, and what God has begun by the Spirit to do in them already – and what they have accepted, in accepting Christ, that God should do. For Christians, their lives no longer make sense on their own. They are lives that have Christ’s name stamped on them, and so lives that are marked for destruction and reconstruction, crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">There is indeed a substitutionary logic in this understanding: Christ has stood in the place of sinners so that they might stand in his. He has lived unselfishly among them and suffered the consequences of their animosity and hatred, in order to destroy that animosity and hatred and to make it possible for them to live beyond its shadow. But he did not suffer and die so that they would not have to, but in order that they might die <span class="italic">with </span>him, and so be raised to life with him.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Let me put all this a different way, using a story from the Old Testament as a parable.</p>
				<p class="quotes">3Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, 4instructing them, ‘Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, “I have lived with Laban as an alien, and stayed until now; 5and I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male and female slaves; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.”’ 6The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, ‘We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.’ 7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">13From what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau, 14two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 15thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. 16These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, ‘Pass on ahead of me, and put a space between drove and drove’. … 20For he thought, ‘I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me’. …</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">331Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids. 2He put the maids with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. 3He himself went on ahead of them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near his brother.  4But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.</p>
				<p class="quotes-second-para">5When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he said, ‘Who are these with you?’ Jacob said, ‘The children whom God has graciously given your servant’. … 8Esau said, ‘What do you mean by all this company that I met?’ Jacob answered, ‘To find favour with my lord.’ 9But Esau said, ‘I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.’ 10Jacob said, ‘No, please; if I find favour with you, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God – since you have received me with such favour.’</p>
				<p class="source">Genesis 32.3–7, 13–16, 20; 33.1–5, 8–10</p>
				<p class="text">Jacob made a habit of running away. When he had stolen the blessing due to Esau, he fled to the land of his uncle Laban. Years later, once he had taken from Laban more than Laban intended to give, he fled back again. This second flight, however, brings him back towards Esau, and as soon as his brother looms on the horizon Jacob begins to panic. He makes elaborate defensive preparations – spending all the substance he has acquired in order to turn away Esau’s anger.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">But Esau runs to meet him, embraces him, falls on his neck and kisses him; he steps past all his brother’s defensive preparations and unexpectedly accepts him. Jacob, all his elaborate preparations undone, weeps in his brother’s arms – and becomes a theologian. He says to his brother, ‘Truly, to see your face is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me with such favour.’ In Esau’s disarming acceptance – this gratuitous, undeserved, unearned acceptance, acceptance that sweeps away all the attempts that Jacob has made to secure it, acceptance that makes a new future possible despite the tangled history that lies behind them – Jacob recognizes the likeness of God.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Jacob’s entire self is built from deceits, strategies, negotiations and defensiveness. He has practised it in all his encounters: snatching what he can from life, and running from the consequences. That is simply who he now is, and we have seen no hint of any buried resources that might help him become a different kind of person; even in the midst of their encounter, Jacob tries to win Esau over by offering him further gifts and by calling him ‘my lord’. But Esau responds, ‘I have enough, <span class="italic">my brother</span>.’ Esau reminds him that not everything can be negotiated, that he loves him because of the givenness of the blood relationship between them, rather than because of anything Jacob has managed to earn or coerce. And this reminder of a relationship deeper than negotiation, deeper than defence and coercion, acts as a judgement upon the self that Jacob has built, the self that he has become. It marks that self out as unnecessary, as destructive, as an obstacle to the recognition of this true relation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Yet Jacob, it seems, could not fully accept Esau’s sincerity. He weeps; he recognizes the face of God in Esau’s face – but if you read on you will see that he does not stop negotiating. Apparently still worrying that Esau is acting only to further his own advantage, Jacob refuses to call him ‘brother’, and keeps up his strategic use of the language of ‘lord’ and ‘servant’; he urges his gifts upon Esau again and makes his excuses so that they need not travel too far together. No common future is built upon the moment of clarity and recognition that Esau’s generosity has allowed, and the last that we hear is that the land has proved insufficient to support both of them, and that Esau with all his wives and children and livestock and property has moved to a place ‘some distance from his brother’. The two men continued to relate as rivals, as competitors, unable to find a common good in a land of limited resources; they do not find a way of living together as brothers, held together by a bond deeper than competition. Esau’s disarming acceptance of his brother, which undermines and judges the defensive stratagems from which Jacob had built his life, is not allowed to do its transformative work.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Christian gospel tells of something like the glimpse of God’s face that Jacob saw in the face of his brother Esau. It is a message of disarming acceptance – the news that one is held by a gratuitous love that undermines and overthrows the self one has built from defensiveness and calculation, or lost in self-hatred and distintegration. One is met by a love that steps over all the boundaries one has scratched around the territory one calls one’s own, all the ways one has of deploying one’s substance to negotiate a position in the world, all the subtle stratagems one uses to protect oneself against rejection, or all one’s ways of making oneself invisible, all one’s ways of vanishing behind other people’s substance and strategems. One is, Christians say, accepted by a love that is non-negotiable, as unavoidable as a blood relationship, and so by a love that one can neither secure nor avoid: a love in the face of which one’s manoeuvring and bargaining or disappearing and self-deprecation are irrelevances. It is a love that exposes and condemns the acquisitive, defensive, strategic ‘self’ or the dissipated, fretted, untended ‘self’ that one has created.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">So this Christian gospel is good news that crucifies. It eats away at the diseased roots of one’s self-understanding, one’s understanding of others and one’s understanding of the world. The gospel is, Christians say, the message that, because one is held in a loving regard that one can neither coerce nor fight off and that has no shadow of selfishness about it – no shadow of one’s being co-opted into somebody else’s strategies or fantasies – one is set free to see and to love one’s own finitude, one’s own limitation, one’s own mortality, and to surrender that finite, limited, mortality to the love that upholds the world. Because the gospel assures one that one is held by a love that invites one truly to be oneself, one discovers that one does not need to carve out, fence round and defend any other kind of space in the world; one does not need to throw up walls to keep out the barbarians; and one does not need to hide behind the faces of others.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">To believe in this loving acceptance is to know that one’s old self is judged and overturned; to hear this ‘Yes’ is to hear a ‘No’ to the current shape of one’s life. And so the gospel comes, according to Christianity, as a completely free, utterly gratuitous, totally unearned gift – but nevertheless as a gift that one has to learn to accept, if one is not like Jacob to walk away from it, carrying one’s possessions with one. In older Christian language, the gospel is an inextricable mix of ‘justification’ (the news that one is accepted, despite one’s unworthiness) and ‘sanctification’ (the total reshaping of one’s broken, defensive life to make it a reflection of this gratuitous love, which is one’s learning of what this free acceptance means).</p>
				<p class="text-indent">In the view I am expounding, justification precedes sanctification: it is both the condition for and the driver of sanctification. It is not that God accepts human beings once they have become holy or in view of the fact that they will become holy; God accepts them <span class="italic">so</span> that they will become holy.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">God’s sending of Jesus <span class="italic">is</span> God’s way of accepting the world – or, more fully, the sending of Jesus and the Spirit is God’s way of accepting the world. <span class="italic">That</span> Jesus and the Spirit are sent is God’s justifying, accepting work; wherever they are received, wherever God’s accepting work becomes real in people’s lives, that is sanctification.</p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Having said so much about crucifixion and resurrection, and so emphasized the extent to which the Christian gospel speaks about a discontinuity between one’s ‘old’ self and one’s ‘new’ self, it is important to balance this with a picture of salvation that stresses continuity more. We can, perhaps, use the image of ‘transfiguration’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">The Christian gospel assures me that my whole self – the self that I have become, that includes all the grit and moss that I have picked up – is the arena in which God is at work, to transform me and ready me for life lived ever deeper in God’s love. God wants to make my whole life, everything that I am, shine with the light of Christ.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">It is true, of course, that there is in Christian understanding no way towards God which does not involve what I have been calling crucifixion: the putting to death of one’s ‘old self’. But the process in which that takes place does not have to be seen as a process in which one ceases to be oneself, or as a process in which one is severed from one’s history. It can be seen, rather, as a process in which one’s whole self, with its history, is <span class="italic">redeemed</span>. The forgiveness, the acceptance, that meets one in the gospel is a forgiveness that takes hold of all this mess that one is, and uses it as the material of one’s salvation.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">Rowan Williams, in his book <span class="italic">Resurrection</span>, uses Simon Peter’s encounter with the risen Jesus in Galilee as an example of this. Having betrayed Jesus three times, Simon Peter is deliberately reminded by Jesus of his betrayal.</p>
				<p class="quotes">Simon has to recognize himself as betrayer: that is part of the past that makes him who he is. If he is to be called again, if he can again become a true apostle, the ‘Peter’ that he is in the purpose of Jesus rather than the Simon who runs back into the cosy obscurity of ‘ordinary’ life, his failure must be assimilated, lived through again and brought to good and not to destructive issue.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-275" id="footnote-169-275-backlink">275</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-line-above">Jesus invites Peter to discover that his betrayal has not broken the call that God has for him. He is invited to discover that Jesus ‘accepts, forgives, bears and absolves the hurt done’,<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-276" id="footnote-169-276-backlink">276</a></span> and that he can take Peter the betrayer and make him the feeder of his sheep. What Peter receives is not ‘innocence’ – the pretence that his betrayal did not happen – but transfiguring grace.</p>
				<p class="text-indent">Grace, then – God’s gift in the gospel – need not be understood as the gift of forgetfulness; it does not enable a Christian to pretend that her past has never happened. It is not the gift of a wholly new identity unrelated to what she has so far been. Like Jesus on the lakeshore, it reminds her of her history, takes her through it again, but invites her to see how the person who did all this, who is broken in all these ways, can become an icon of God’s life in the world.<span class="Endnote-Reference"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-169-277" id="footnote-169-277-backlink">277</a></span></p>
				<p class="text-indent">This learning is a process in which one’s self continues to be <span class="italic">made</span>. It is not the unlocking of an innocent self locked away behind this history, essentially unaffected by it; it is the transformation of the self that <span class="italic">is </span>this history. But the process of crucifixion and resurrection that I have been talking about is also a process in which one’s self is <span class="italic">found</span>: it is a process in which one uncovers the self that one is in the purposes of God, the self that God who sees one truly knows one to be, the self that is ‘hid with Christ in God’ (Colossians 3.3). One is called to the process of ‘becoming who one is’.</p>
				<p class="text-indent-line-below">God is, in this view, a bit like a conversation partner with whom one can discuss oneself, who constantly prompts one to think again, when one has settled into forgetfulness, or into smug or despairing attitudes towards one’s past actions and present options. God constantly needles one towards knowledge of one’s deepest truth; and the crucifixion and resurrection of one’s self that God brings about is not an imposition, but one’s awakening to true freedom. In calling human beings deeper into Godself, God is at the same time calling them deeper into an undistorted self-knowledge, self-knowledge <span class="italic">without shame</span>.</p>

				<ol>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">In this chapter I have swept past more detailed discussion of the nature of justification and its relationship to sanctification, even though this is still a complex issue with big implications for ecumenical debate. It is worth looking at the recent remarkable Lutheran–Catholic <span class="italic">Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</span>, available online at the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/ecumenicaldialogue/roman catholic/jddj/index.html. Other good resources include Gerhard Forde, <span class="italic">Justification by Faith </span>(Mifflintown, PA: Sigler, 1991); Hans Küng, <span class="italic">Justification: The Doctrine of Karl Barth and a Catholic Reflection</span> (London: Burns and Oates, 1966); Veli-Matti Karkkainen, <span class="italic">One With God: Salvation As Deification And Justification </span>(Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2005); and Alister McGrath, <span class="italic">Iustitia Dei: A History of the Christian Doctrine of Justification </span>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986).</li>
					<li class="numbered-list" xml:lang="en-GB">The debate about penal substitution is also a hot one. In fact, it seems to be one of the fault-lines of contemporary theology. On one side of the divide stand those who dispensed with the penal substitution model long ago, and barely give it a thought except to find fault with it again; on the other side stand those for whom it is the pith and kernel of the Christian gospel. To my eye, there does not seem to be a great deal of middle ground. Good accounts include Steve Holmes, ‘Can Punishment Bring Peace? A Reconsideration of Penal Substitution’ <span class="italic">Scottish Journal of Theology </span>58.1 (2005), pp. 104–23; Kim Fabricius, ‘Ten Propositions on Penal Substitution’, Faith and Theology blog, 1 August 2006, http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/ 2006/08/ten-propositions-on-penal-substitution.html; and Steve Jeffrey, Mike Ovey and Andrew Sach, <span class="italic">Pierced for Our Transgressions: Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution </span>(London: IVP, 2007) together with a response by N.

This is a Christian reading: a reading that starts by putting this story in the position that Christian tradition has given it (as the story of the first sin and its punishment, the paradigm of all sin and punishment) and then reads it again to see ways in which it might not quite fit into the traditional story as normally told, and ways in which it might be reread so as to make us reconceive the topics to which, in Christian tradition, it is tied.</p>
