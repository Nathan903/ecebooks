<h2 class="fronttitle"><i>FAITH AND CULTURES SERIES</i></h2>
<p class="frontc">An Orbis Series on Contextualizing Gospel and Church General Editor: Robert J. Schreiter, C.PP.S.</p>
<p class="body-text">The <i>Faith and Cultures Series</i> deals with questions that arise as Christian faith attempts to respond to its new global reality. For centuries Christianity and the church were identified with European cultures. Although the roots of Christian tradition lie deep in Semitic cultures and Africa, and although Asian influences on it are well documented, that original diversity was widely forgotten as the church took shape in the West.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, as the churches of the Americas, Asia, and Africa take their place alongside older churches of Mediterranean and North Atlantic cultures, they claim their right to express Christian faith in their own idioms, thought patterns, and cultures. To provide a forum for better understanding this situation, the Orbis <i>Faith and Cultures Series</i> publishes books that illuminate the range of questions that arise from this global challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">Orbis and the <i>Faith and Cultures Series</i> General Editor invite the submission of manuscripts on relevant topics.</p>
