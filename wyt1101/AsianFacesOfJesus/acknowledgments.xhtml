<p class="indent">Though at the outset producing a book may seem to be a solitary effort of a single person, in reality it is a corporate work of a number of people. I am deeply grateful to the following for their generous help: Robert Ellsberg, the editor-in-chief of Orbis Books for asking me to edit this collection; Susan Perry, editor, for her invaluable comments and, more important, for her friendship and support; Daniel O'Connor, a former colleague with whom I first discussed the idea of this volume, for the encouragement which enabled me to carry this project through; the Central Library staff at the Selly Oak Colleges—Meline Nielsen, Louise Wilmot, Katrina Youster, Griselda Lartey, Gill Davies and Willemina Morton—who continue to welcome me in spite of my outrageous demands; all the copyright holders of the articles for their kind permission to reprint them; and finally, my wife, Sharada, whose presence persistently reminds me that there are many paths to the Truth.</p>
